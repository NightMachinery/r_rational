  There were a lot of components that went into any good magic system,
#+end_quote

- Really interested in hearing what AW identifies these components as.

- Also, there's a parallel to Joon's ultimatum to Blue and Perisev's to Joon. Both Blue and Joon are very fixated on self-justification here. Joon ultimately refused cooperation - will Blue?

- What does the Gold entity(?) want? It appears intelligent. Will its ever increasing demands seek to ruin Joon? Can he negotiate with it, perhaps at high levels of Gold Magic? Is it guided by any goals other than increased marked gold, and if so how strategic is it about them? Is it something like a homunculus Gold!Joon (similar to the levelup!Joon if he had been a separare entity?)

- It seems like Gold Magic might be about sunk costs, or digging yourself in deeper, or knowing when to turn back (paralleled with the logistics of the flight to the moon and space-travel's associations with points of no return...) And also about paranoia, obsession, abusive relationships, and voices in your head. So far, it seems to have already have begun on a path of setting some cracks in Joon's relationships.

- Joon beat Onion in a bladebound contest. Joon didn't get to use the same tricks here - instead, with his hoard of gold, he out-dragoned Perisev.

- Also, barring finding the relevant exclusion, this ends the Joon/Amaryllis-self-modification discussion. Hopefully this and the gold magic don't result in a downward spiral.

Doubt she's a DMPC. Realistically it's just a straightforward factor of the Doe seeing her as a shackle. And the Doe has obviously known Solace for centuries through multiple rebirths- it makes sense that the Doe sees Solace as a crone.

Joon can't self-modify 'effectively,' but he could still feasibly fumble around with Spirit magic and make long-term changes, even if he can't see what he's doing the way he could with soul magic.

**** There are a couple reasons to think that path is barred. One, is that it was brought up so explicitly right before all those plans were made obsolete - it seems unlikely that this would turn out to be of no consequence, from a lower-case n narrative standpoint.

Two, Joon had an unrivalled facility with Essentialism. No other soul mage got clear labels and numerical values. On the other hand, what Joon has for Spirit is perhaps as bad as possible, and without being able to refer back to what's going on in the Soul, it is unclear whether he can even determine a collection of threads whose modification would yield what he wants. Just confer with all the discussion around whether Joon's clamping down pain made him into a homicidal maniac Onion-killer back a few posts ago.

Spirit doesn't work in a clearcut way like Soul, so the default /isn't/ "just turn some knobs". And we have no reason to think that something as complicated as creating a sex-drive for Amaryllis, potentially ex nihilo, is within Joon's purview. That said, the author could go any number of ways with things, and often does the unexpected. We don't even /know/ that essentialism's out, that they won't find it conveniently Excluded to their current residence once they turn back home. But I think a lot of us assume that the default position is that those plans are gone.

** I found these chapters hard to read, not in the sense that they were poorly written or constructed, but because I found the undercurrent of fatalism, futility and hopelessness running through them tough. There were much needed moments of levity and happiness that I really enjoyed, but threaded through every event was just this sense of inevitable failure. In that way it feels like a sharp contrast to the last batch of chapters, where we left on a (relative) high note and a hope for the future of the Doris Finch EZ.

In particular, the killing of the two dragons was /almost exciting/, but just felt wasteful and sad

The news shows you the missiles go up, doesn't show them when they go down. Especially the bodies.

I have a rant where I complain about how silly/messed up it is that Vader killed millions and millions of kids but when it's /his/ kid on the ground going "daddy it hurts" he suddenly grows a heart. Onetime someone thought I was talking about the prequels and I was like "no bro, that was the very first movie. He blew up a planet. /There were kids on that planet./"

Yeah, the whole second half of this act (basically everything from the first confrontation above ground on) just made me feel irrationally angry. Like yes Essentialism has been ridiculous, /but/ it was also integral to almost everything the party has done and the dangers they faced meant it wasn't really a mismatch that the DM should have removed. It's resolved otherwise intractable problems in interesting ways, and offered hints about really cool ways that some of the most unsatisfying permanent losses might be resolved happily someday where no other skill could do so. With that tool gone, an entire world of numeric certainty is gone, and the exclusion doesn't even appear to be enpersoned or locational so it seems like he's just completely screwed. Amaryllis can never become his perfect mate through editing herself to gain a fundamental part of human experience that she was born without, so that whole sexual incompatibility is just going to grate on their relationship either forever or until it breaks. Without the ability to repair from his backup soul he might now be permanently disfigured from the dragon fire which would just be gross. This loss is just so enormous and the enormity hasn't even sunk in yet.

Gold magic is at least /explicitly/ temporary which will make its eventual loss still annoying but decidedly more palatable, but the last paragraphs where people are just being silent at Joon make me expect that it will fuck up all his relationships even worse than they were already fucked up and I think he's going to make some really really annoying choices before he gets off the ride. That's going to be hard for me to read. ugh.

And in the face of all the rest of it, losing the Egress is a huge blow too. That would have been devastating alone if we didn't have much worse things immediately adjacent.

I think the problem from a more meta perspective is that Joon found ways to gain ultimate power early in the story at a low level. They were really cool to read. But then because of all the munchkining (which don't get me wrong I looove that shit) he doesn't have any urgency towards getting "legitimate" level ups that would let him have a high /base/ power level without the "cheats" that seem to cause exclusions. Thus the only way to continue to have a "boy becomes man" type of story, is for him to get periodically nerfed into the fucking ground. Ouch. Maybe he'll figure this out before things get worse, or maybe in the end he'll find a way to un-Exclude things and reform them so they don't get excluded again (I can dream).

--------------

Ugh. I still love the story overall. Gold magic is new and interesting from an MC perspective. The fights with the dragons were exciting. I still want to see all the skills and their virtues get revealed and munchkined--that's been really really creatively and excellently done so far. But I feel kinda winded. Maybe I just like Mary Sues too much, but fuck the Dungeon Master. I can't wait to see him get killed/usurped.

I really feel the need to comment on this because I feel like it's...look, I'm gonna settle for "Joon editing to match instead would have been an equally valid option". The human experience is different for everyone, and barring base survival requirements like "everyone drinks water" I don't think any part of it can be said to be fundamental. To the species as a whole, sure, but not to every individual or even to every group of individuals.

****** That's true, although my understanding is that a lot of how the spirit was understood was through where it hooked up to the soul; without the soul sight aspect of Essentialism, it'd be a lot like trying to modify a program with generic variable names to produce targeted changes in a database which you can't see.

I can think of a couple things that might work (looking for differences in spirit activity while engaging in sexual activity being the most obvious one) but they'd come with risks (primarily, the risk of modifying something unintended) that I can't imagine the party signing off on. Basically the spirit just isn't labeled nearly as well and I think that nixes the idea.

...I hope this isn't going to come back and cause problems with the level up thing somehow later down the line. levelup!Joon did promise some pretty scary stuff if he ever returned, I'm not sure how they'd deal with it this go around, and fumbling around half-blind with the spirit seems like a good way to accidentally summon him again. What is it they say around here sometimes? "I will not call up what I cannot put down"? Something like that. Let's hope these guys are smart enough to keep that in mind...

***** Meh I don't agree with that at all (and by extension, yes, I don't agree with Joon's idea in the story that editing himself is equivalent. It'd have been an act of caring in a more extreme version of people who shave their heads to support those close to them who have cancer, but it's not equivalent).

But I guess it depends on how ridiculously narrow you want to define "core part of human experience." I think all five senses, as well as the emotions, maturation stages, and the generalized life experiences that the vast majority of the species get, all qualify easily. I think that it's both absurd and inviting bad outcomes to exclude any of them conceptually, and just because not every single person gets an experience doesn't mean it's not fundamental. Importantly, the concept doesn't mean people without sexual desire are less than or deserve exclusion any more than it would mean the same about a blind person. It merely recognizes that there is something which is both important and typical that they sadly don't get to be part of, and that that is true whether or not they feel the loss themselves prior to having the experience become available through magic.

But I can concede at the same time that the classification is one based at least in part on subjective value, rather than moral principle. I think it's silly to do so, but it's not /objectively/ wrong.

****** I read (past tense) "fundamental" to refer to the experience being fundamental to BEING human (which implies...less humanity in asexual people, since they're missing something that's "fundamental to being human", which definitely invites bad outcomes), and I'm like 98% sure that's not at all how you intended it based on what you've said here. So, definitional mismatch on that, I think.

Similar feeling for the "core part of human experience" thing; I'm not sure I even understand what the term means if it's not "core part of the experience of being human", which then again kind of implies that missing any of it means being less human (unless you can be human but not experience being human, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me). Again, though, that's how I read it. I wouldn't say it's an entirely out-there reading (which is why I felt the need to comment), but at the same time it doesn't look at all like what you were going for.

Regardless, I would define core human experience VERY narrowly, and I'd disagree that that's a ridiculous stance to take. I'd refer to the stuff you're describing as "core" as something like "common" instead; the vast majority of people have that shared experience, and that's useful information to keep in mind, but assuming any individual does is also something that'd invite bad outcomes. Take note of the majority but account for statistical outliers, don't assume any individual falls into the majority simply because it's likely, etc. I'd reserve "core" for...you know, I'm actually not sure; I tried thinking about how I'd classify "language" and realised it's a grey area. I'll have to ponder that some more; this post is long enough as it is.

That said, I don't think it's the only valid stance, and it seems apparent you have a different one. That's fine! The thing I was worried about was this leading into dehumanisation of asexuals (I have a personal stake in that not happening, though I am not asexual myself), which doesn't seem to be the case here and which I'm definitely not accusing you of. Maybe a little trigger-happy because it's something I'd accuse OTHER people who have used this line of reasoning of, but that's not really relevant in this context beyond explaining my initial motivation.

Although I'm not sure "missing the desire to have sex" and "missing the ability to see" are quite comparable, and there are SOME issues surrounding the idea of treating asexuality as a disability in the same way we do blindness, that's ultimately secondary to the underlying conversation. It mostly manifests, I believe, as more asexual people refusing the hypothetical option to become more sexual than blind people would refuse the offer of sight, and in theory both groups should be respected in their decision regardless, so it really shouldn't matter.

I will say I prefer my perspective because I think it gives me a better sense of how drastically different from each other people can be while still being human, but I'm pretty sure everyone prefers their personal perspective and I would guess that yours acquires that sense via a different mechanism; I can vaguely picture a few, but they're not my own so I can't get much further than "they exist and are workable".

I'll also say that writing this gave me a good opportunity to really sit and think about how I viewed these sorts of things and (more importantly) how other people do, so I do appreciate that.

Oh, and I think it's important to note that the impact of becoming sexual/becoming asexual (coming from the opposite, in a highly simplified sense) is also something that varies from person to person; I'd guess the idea of becoming asexual is fairly negative on your end, I'd guess it's less negative on mine, I can't really guess how Joon/Amaryllis feel about it (I probably should be able to, but top of my head, nope), and I'd also guess that impacts how different our views are on the subject.

Lemme know if any of that needs expanding or clarifying; this has been, like, half journal entry for me and I'm posting it now before it gets any more out of hand, so I might have left some rough edges or disjointed stuff in there.

If you or anyone else wants a tl;dr: I think mostly I misunderstood what you meant, but I also think it wasn't an entirely unreasonable way to read it and I'm glad you let me know more about how it was intended. Also some brain dump that probably didn't need to be in there, but adds context to my position and response, I suppose.

******* I enjoyed reading you think about this. One thing which might be of interest to you is deaf culture. Cochlear implants basically cure deafness, but they are only effective (brain plasticity issue) if implanted in young children. Deaf culture is on average strongly anti implanting grounds that it mutilates the child by removing its deafness. Children with cochlear implants are frequently bullied / rejected by deaf people to such an extent that institutions (schools primarily) designed to care for them usually have to separate them. My familiarity with this is due to the majority of my many siblings being deaf and one of them having a cochlear implant. This seemed very tangental I'm sure so let me bring it back to the topic. I think it is very very easy to turn your (general your, not you specifically) disability into a point of pride / identity. I think this makes people resist cures for both themselves and others because it damages their self image. They allow this protective impulse to set them against something that the vast majority of people who have that thing love and would never give up. To explicitly tie my points together. I think your position on asexuality is similar to the deaf communities stance on cochlear implants and I think both are incorrect. I think hearing and sex are both overwhelmingly likely to be sources of joy and that even though people build identities around the lack of those things, we should still treat them as disabilities we would desire to cure.

******** Okay, this came out to about 16,000 characters, so it's getting split up. Whoops. Original post begins below:

This is a good example to use in this context; I have a few thoughts about it. (...reading this understated opening two hours later when I've finally finished typing was pretty funny)

Firstly, personal perspective (and probable bias contributor): I sometimes feel like my sexuality gets in the way of other things in my life, and I feel like for me personally if I was offered the option of giving it up (or, say, tuning in down; something that'd be considered equivalent to "hard of hearing" in your example) it'd be something I'd have to weigh with pros and cons rather than a "what, no" sort of situation. This gives me the initial intuition that it's not quite a one-to-one comparison, but probably leans me towards the conclusion I reached above.

Secondly, I honestly hadn't even considered the topic of minors or young children who are having others make a decision for them. That gets a little complex, and I do get into it later as it's the real meat of the argument (in cases where people can make decisions, respecting them is correct for me pretty much as a centrepiece of my subjective value system; where they don't cause harm to others, etc etc, but we're not here to dig out my entire values matrix!) but for now suffice it to say that none of my reasoning really applies to "what to decide for people who can't decide for themselves", and also to say that I'm not asexual myself which changes the character of my position compared to a deaf person arguing against the implants for someone else.

Thirdly, there's some inaccuracy in comparing sexuality to something like hearing. The big one is that hearing provides obvious mechanical benefits to a variety of activities; sexuality provides, to the individual, access to a single class of activity and primarily social benefits otherwise. Obviously there's tangential overlap between sexuality and other spheres of experience, but in most cases that's by choice: people produce art related to sex, or bring sexual topics into other areas of life. In the case of sound, the effort required would be to keep them OUT, so there's a baseline part of most (arguably all, if one considers "silence as distinct from sound" to be part of being able to hear) experiences that's gone missing.

The other main one is that sexuality brings with it a level of compulsion (at least, this is how I understand it). There's a case to be argued for this for any sensory input; that a desire to consume sugar to excess isn't a reason to argue taste is a net negative, for instance. The difference I'd draw here is that I'd blame the desire on sugar in the first instance, and on sexuality itself in the second. I feel that offering someone with sex addiction the opportunity to become asexual would be declined less often than offering someone the loss of their sense of taste in response to unhealthy levels of consumption, and I feel like this matters in some way. (Note though that the use of "feel" was consciously chosen here; I have no hard data and only my general instinct on how humans work to draw on, so I'm mainly putting this here as part of my thinking. In particular it can be argued that sexuality is multifaceted and level of compulsion is but one of those facets, and that adjusting it in isolation would be preferable to turning the whole thing off)

There's some additional nasty complications around a "cure" for asexuality being conceptually similar to a "cure" for homosexuality. There is something in there which is okay on paper (the hypothetical ability to allow people to change their sexuality at will is hard to construe as a negative; even with social pressures, the blame rests with the social pressures and not the technology), but referring to it as a cure causes...I want to just say "messiness", but the sort of messiness that can make it actually worse in practice to try and develop something. Like, if you go out into the world and say "we should cure asexuals" that's liable to lead to people doing stupid bad things a la conversion therapy.

There's also the literal meaning of "disability" to think about. Deafness is literally an inability to hear, but attempting to express asexuality in similar terms leads to something like "inability to feel sexual desire/attraction" (pretending for a moment that asexuality refers just to the endpoint on a spectrum of sexual desire, rather than the swath of that spectrum considered sufficiently lower than average as is traditional). It's a different kind of lack, and unlike the inability to do something, the general class is not inherently negative: an inability to feel despair would be argued by many to be a positive. This means that disability is a poor match, term-wise, for asexuality, and that its use loads towards asexuality being a negative in a way that I don't consider justified. I don't know what term I'd use in its place, though.

After sitting and writing, I think what I'm coming to is that...I was originally going to say something about a category difference but I keep coming back to the idea that there are some environments where one would PREFER to be deaf, hypothetically, but we a) basically don't inhabit one, and b) have tools to apply temporary deafness (earplugs, etc) if required. Sexuality lacks both of these; there's no on/off switch, and it's a lot more ambiguous as to whether an individual would prefer it or not in many environments that exist or could reasonably exist today.

What I'd argue then, is that in the case of asexuality there's an argument to be made that sexuality is...okay, nothing is truly an unalloyed good, but sexuality is less so than hearing and a line must be drawn somewhere and wherever I'd draw it, it's somewhere in between them. It might just come down to personal value; I value differences between people fairly highly, and value finding joy more than following a path to it. The tricky part, then, comes in determining what is best for someone whose own values are unclear or undeveloped.

On that subject...I don't know. There's enough differentiation that it feels wrong to me to make an irreversible decision for somebody early in their life in the way that one would for deafness, but at the same time it's easy to picture people regretting that the intervention wasn't performed on their behalf later in life, but at the same time it's easy to imagine that that's not fundamental but rather due to societal values in which case I'd argue the fix is to change those values rather than change people to fit them (this is a general position I hold; change society before forcibly applying change to people), but at the same time we live in a society [bottom text haha] so it's really difficult to tell whether it's a social issue or fundamental one.

I suppose when it comes down to it I would say we should err on the side of social when uncertainty exists because as a general rule that will cause less harm (certainly, enough harm has been done by erring on the fundamental side that I would prefer to give the alternative a go), but I am aware that if I were actually in a decision-making position this would be a high-stakes decision that would require constant outcome monitoring and course correction. Weighing on this, too, is that I think erring in favour of non-intervention is an important principle in this area; the burden of proof is on the intervention to demonstrate overwhelmingly that applying it is a significant positive and not applying it is a significant negative. This will lead, in individual cases, to interventions not being applied that may have provided net positive, but sticking to the principle will additionally prevent interventions that apply net negatives (potentially quite significant ones) which I believe to be a net positive trade-off, to the degree one can ascribe "trade-off" to people's lives.

********* [Post-cut second section; I could probably have been more succinct, but there's enough nuance that I don't really trust myself to not express something seriously screwed up that I don't actually think without a full brain dump, so to speak. This way I can be assured that if I do express something of the sort then it'll be something I ACTUALLY think and attacks on it will be justified]

I'm getting a brain tingle here on "deafness enhances other senses and provides a different but not worse sensorium" as a line of argument, and that hearing is primarily better also because the world has been built for people who can hear and we could change that instead, and even that requirements to hear that aren't social have largely been eliminated...and I almost feel like there's some merit to all that, as it's similar substantially to what I'm saying about asexuality, and there's interesting comparisons to make to hypothetical alien species with different sensory experience. One could say that the human sensorium co-evolved with hearing in mind, but the same is true of sexuality! But then that could devolve (heh) easily into saying it's true of HETEROsexuality, which would flow into curing people of homosexuality, which there's a much stronger and obvious ideological objection to.

Actually, that brings up an interesting point: sexuality is a spectrum; there's not just "sexual" vs. "asexual", there's differing levels of desire and compulsion and payoff for each individual. Supposing we found an "ideal" point on this spectrum: would it then be correct to, assuming it possible, tune everyone to hit that point? Hell, if we found a point on the spectrum that no human is born with that provides more joy than any point humans ARE born with, should we tune for THAT? This starts to intersect with the idea of engineering people for enhanced pleasure and away from their humanity as a result, and into questions of what a "human" really is, and...well, parsing the implications could be an entire topic in and of itself, but I think my conclusion is that making changes to "increase joy" isn't an unalloyed good and that the argument for cochlear implants that runs along the lines of decreasing suffering instead (hearing being a useful tool to avoid negative outcomes in a variety of circumstances) is stronger. That argument doesn't apply to sexuality, which I would therefore say weakens the comparison.

A comparable subject is perhaps autism; I received an intervention for this in my teenage years (cognitive behavioural therapy, specifically) and I don't know whether to credit it with improved personal functionality but I do know that there are a number of things that are generally categorised as "part of autism" that I would regret no longer having on an object level rather than an "I've built my identity around it" level. Well, half and half; I have built an identity around these capabilities and behavioural patterns, to an extent, but I feel like from a neutral position they would still be valid things to select. I feel like sexuality constitutes an opportunity to engage in a specific source of joy but also a kind of push to do so, and that the negatives of the push could for some people be considered to outweigh the positives of the option (I know I've felt this to be true at times >_>).

Perhaps, then, the answer is that we shouldn't be looking for a "cure" so much as a way to deal with negative externalities that might arise. An option to allow people to "switch on" without soldering the thing into the on position. I think that's where I'm running into friction: The negative externality of being deaf is not being able to hear, but the negative externality of asexuality is not feeling a specific motivation towards a specific activity and a specific payoff from engaging in it.

Bringing us back on topic, Amaryllis engages in sexual activity in the story and receives a payoff: Joon's satisfaction from the encounter. She just doesn't experience the motivation or payoff that someone with "baseline" sexuality would. Without going into too many personal details that I'm sure nobody wants to hear, I will just say that from personal experience I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this modality. Certainly I don't think there's enough wrong with it to justify early life intervention to prevent it. (EDIT: whoops, unintended double negative)

Indeed, of hypothetical magic solutions to the issue, the ability to snap one's fingers and select a sexuality (pun intended) at will seems more appealing. Of course, a volume knob on one's hearing would be strictly superior to the cochlear implant we have today, but I think more people would spend some of their time tuned to "asexual" than tuned to "deaf".

To conclude my ramblings...I think it's a good comparison for illuminating the issue but I don't think it's a good enough comparison to function as an open-and-shut case. I think in the case of people competent to make decisions we should respect their wishes in both cases; I don't think this is a point of difference.

But I think in the case of people we have to make decisions FOR...well, ordinarily I'd say try to have them understand as best as possible the decision being made, but the nature of sexuality makes this both impossible and irresponsible. As-is, what I'd say is that the focus should be on dealing with unambiguous negatives rather than chasing even unambiguous positives; I think the stronger argument for hearing is that there are negatives attached that are not "missing out on a positive", and I don't think that argument applies to asexuality. Combined with our general history of intervening in sexuality at younger ages, I would say that seeking a "cure" is not a good use of time or resources and that if we're going to wish for hypotheticals, it would be better to wish for a comprehensive at-will sexuality modifier than for the removal of asexuality during development.

Perhaps later advances in relevant fields and human understanding will open up some path I'm not considering or change the calculus, but for now I think this is where I'm at. Definitely something to reassess as society progresses (notably we could find that asexuality has baseline negative impact on overall psychology, but equally we could find that it has baseline POSITIVE impact; evolution is a blind idiot god, after all), but for where we're at now I'm...not necessarily "comfortable" with this position, but I think it's the only one I can feel reasonable staking out as part of a complicated issue. I don't think asexuality causes direct negatives, I think the indirect negatives (i.e. positives being missed out on) are not absolute, and therefore I don't think that early intervention is justified in the same way that it is for something like deafness where there are direct negatives which are being prevented. Indeed, the ease of building up an identity around the shared non-experience indicates that we generally do not end up with people regretting not having received an intervention earlier in life, which further suggests that such an intervention doesn't clear the bar to be performed.

There's some more big-picture questions, like where the correct trade-off point between species-wide human suffering and species-wide human diversity is, but that starts bleeding out into other topics real fast, so I'll cut it here. Again, well-chosen example; while I think the comparison has flaws that render the positions sufficiently non-identical to hold differing ones on each side, I think FINDING those flaws has been an important exercise in clarifying why doing so is reasonable (at least, in my opinion).

In case anyone wants a tl;dr: I don't think the comparison is apples-to-apples enough to justify a hypothetical intervention for asexuality similar to cochlear implants, I wouldn't support such an intervention if it existed, and I don't think the comparison correctly captures my position, either. I think it's close enough to be interesting and informative, but not to correctly sum up or fully analogise the position I have taken. I also don't think disability is the right word for asexuality, I think asexuality itself is more like the zero state on a multi-dimensional spectrum of variables that comprise sexuality (EDIT: As discussed and as Amaryllis presents in the story; in common parlance it refers to a whole slice of the spectrum), and I'm not convinced that even said zero state is an unalloyed or even net negative, let alone other states on that spectrum. In terms of hypothetical interventions, I think the only reasonable ones would require informed consent and that any intervention prior to the capacity for informed consent is not indicated.

Again, let me know if any clarification is desired or of potential negative externalities from this line of thought.

********** Again, I appreciated watching you think about this. I feel slightly bad that I'm not going to give as extensive of a response.

Deaf adults pretty uniformly deny that there are meaningful downsides to being deaf and that there are social benefits to being deaf that outweigh the minor downsides. That makes it seem, through your lens, like we should not be attempting to ‘cure' (A word that deaf culture hates) deafness. However, deaf adults have an average of a 6th grade reading level (average of 10th grade for the gen. pop.) and correspondingly lower income. As a very interested outside observer, deafness seems like it actively degrades quality of life (QoL) yet, from the inside, they cannot tell.

I don't really know anything about the asexual community and a brief Google search did not turn up any research that looked either topical or credible. But I have the opposite impression that you do. I think (to acknowledge your intentional use of feel I want to point out that I used ‘think' here as a concession of uncertainty) that asexuality must reduce QoL on average. It seems like it must make it harder to pair-bond in the long term ways that bring long term QoL advantages. The number of people that would want to pair-bond with an asexual must be considerably reduced and presumably they don't benefit from the oxytocin bonding effects that most of us get from sex. I could be wrong about all this but my experience with the deaf community has primed me to be suspicious of self reported outcomes.

I actually totally agree with you that persons (roughly adults) should have final and full decision making power over their self, whether or not they make ‘bad' choices with that. But I don't think society should make the mistake of promoting things that are bad for most people even if we promote autonomy that allows people to make ‘bad' decisions. I think our society should be encouraging the implantation of deaf babies and (research pending, assuming I'm right about QoL) encouraging ‘curing' asexuals.

*********** My lens doesn't say curing deafness is a negative; the point I was making is that I'm not using QoL as a metric (or at least, limiting the use in specific ways) because it's corruptible. If you're arguing for "all changes that improve QoL should be taken", you run into issues with turning people into joy machines (or more realistically, designer babies). This isn't automatically bad, but it's not automatically good, either, so I'm not relying on it without having settled on a conclusion. So the metric I'm using is more along the lines of "what bad thing happens" rather than "what good thing doesn't happen".

With deafness it's stuff like "you don't hear a car coming and get hit by it", whereas with asexuality the 'negatives' are all things like "people who consider sex integral to a relationship don't want to be in a relationship with you", and of course the reduced experience from doing something sexual (one thing I did mention last time is that it's not the same thing as sex AVERSION; this comes up in WtC where they engage in sexual activity and Amaryllis mentions that the act itself is meh but knowing someone she cares about derived enjoyment from it is a positive for her, too). In short, lack of positives.

Anyway, the point from earlier was that I don't think we should perform interventions to add potential positives, but thinking about it more I come to two things: firstly, we shouldn't be doing that YET, it's something that should probably be a whole package deal and "ensuring peak sexuality" comes under the same umbrella as things like ensuring peak muscle and brainpower; it's more like "curing" people of being born with less potential intelligence than it is something like deafness.

There's a lot of literature on this subject (GATTACA is the, like, baby entry-level thing but it's what I'm remembering right now, and there's that short story Yudowsky wrote with three types of alien, one of which was called 'babyeaters'? Three worlds collide or something?), but the point is that the decision to go for species-wide enhancement is distinct, in my opinion, from the decision to do things like curing deafness or genetic edits for faulty cancer-y genes, and while asexuality could be argued to be a grey area I'd argue that it's on the enhancement side. This warrants significant caution on any implementation, which I think separates it from the deafness intervention.

I'm mostly arguing for this point in time; I'll acknowledge that there might be some hypothetical future knowledge set that leads asexuality intervention to be a good idea...but technically that's possible for deafness, too? Less likely, but the future is inherently uncertain and all that. I'm just mostly looking at the here and now and the probable near future, and not seeing it as a good option.

Secondly, I don't think I talked about this enough, but it's very hard to say "we should set people with zero sexuality (out of a hundred, say) to a higher number" while saying "we should set people with one sexuality to that higher number, too". If you wanna set them to one then that makes almost no difference so why bother, and if you want to go higher then it's no longer about giving sexuality to people lacking it, it's about giving more sexuality to people without enough. This is a pretty crude way of putting it, but I didn't just want to say "slippery slope" and run away and I think there is a difference in kind here that highlights how "sexuality" is distinct from "hearing ability" in a way that matters and separates the two in terms of argument.

Also I'll be a little blunter about this, this time around: Part of that argument works against homosexuality. The number of people who want to pair bond with a homosexual is reduced because more people are heterosexual, therefore it reduces QoL on average, therefore we should "cure" it. If I want to reject that (which I do) then I'm rejecting the same argument applied to asexuality as well. (EDIT: Quick train of thought: assuming we have an intervention it could be applied to make the population 50/50 or apply some mix that's considered ideal; but then, that's off into the "enhancement" weeds again, and who's making the decision on what's considered ideal? Big, scary stuff)

The core there is, again, difference vs. diminishment, and I mentioned some stuff about sexuality itself being a possible negative (there are people addicted to sex for whom that reduces QoL; it could be argued their QoL would be increased by having been born asexual). There's some stuff about broad human variability being a positive that has to be counterbalanced by SUFFICIENT negative QoL, not well versed on that score though.

Not sure about the bonding effect thing, but top of head I'm not buying it as an unalloyed positive; it works on people in both good and bad relationships, and as someone in a relationship with an asexual person it kind of feels more meaningful because I know that's not present and it's still working; more room for it to be personal connection and compatibility as opposed to a very direct "I like you" chemical. I doubt this is a good generalisable argument, but the point is more that there are points of view, possessed by non-asexual people, from which the pair bonding itself isn't enough of a reason to intervene.

Random side-train: without some "padding" around what to intervene in and what not to, it would be easy to argue that either asexuality reduces QoL in which case we should intervene, or it INCREASES QoL in which case we should intervene in non-asexuality instead (chance of it being strictly neutral being extremely low). This then goes out to "everything should be changed because everything has some impact on QoL", etc, etc, etc.

The point this makes is to say that I think there's a buffer in here where something has to reduce QoL SUFFICIENTLY to be intervened against. (and, as above, in a removal way rather than a "lack of potential upside" way)

Oh, there's also the whole "change society before changing people" thing. Something can reduce QoL because it's stigmatized in which case the correct response is absolutely not to remove the thing; it's to remove the stigma. So straight QoL research would have to link the reduction to things that apply regardless of culture, which I would think to be a fairly difficult task in this case.

Also! Someone else commented saying that cochlear implants are approaching improvement over regular, unmodified hearing. That actually sums up a lot of what I'm thinking/feeling; asexuality intervention feels a lot more like those implants getting further ahead and then arguing for giving them to people with baseline hearing rather than just people born deaf. It's a different character of argument that comes broadly under "upgrading the human race" rather than "curing things", and I feel roughly the same way about asexuality.

Anyway shorter response was expected; I did a long one because it suited me. Summary is I'm not convinced it's all upside, and even if it was I don't think it's the right kind of upside to make a slam dunk case. I'd be open to new research, although, uh. I'd point to similar "research" about homosexuality and suggest a lot of caution; science may be flawless, but scientists are not.

I'm almost tempted to say that where society is now we literally can't make a good collective decision and so we should stay away from the topic altogether due to a lack of urgency; not in a "don't wrongthink" sense, but in a "conducting unbiased research on this topic is close to impossible because controlling for confounding variables can't be done" sense.

Well, either way, the solution is to completely banish asexual stigma before getting started, so I suppose I'm fine with whichever. If we're ACTUALLY in a world where the research would be conducted out of pure intellectual curiosity and would not be tainted by social impact on the subjects, then we can start answering the question. I don't expect to see this in my lifetime, mind.

EDIT: Also quick pin in "diversity of human experience is valuable in general terms"; I think there's positive there you need to overcome in tradeoff in order to remove any potential experience from all members of the species, and I think existing without sexual attraction (or with a lowered amount) is a distinct experience in this regard. (So is lack of hearing, mind, so it's evidently not an unclearable bar, but)

Actually this opens up a kind of third path: I was talking about a "hearing knob" being superior to a straight deafness cure in an earlier post, and it kind of sounds like that's what she has (indeed, that functions as a much harder slam dunk against the "don't provide the implants" argument; she could choose to remain deaf if she wanted).

I was also talking about an analogous thing for sexuality, which would sidestep the issue entirely, in theory; although now I think about that if we invented it today it would almost certainly be used to have everyone conform to what's considered the social norm, which...sounds really bad.

I think I'm concluding that society sucks and that screws up most if not all attempts at doing something in this area, and that regardless of stance the correct thing to do is get rid of the social forces in question before doing anything else.

#+begin_quote
  I was going to write a whole big thing here about why writing is slow, and what's been going on in my life, but ... it would probably suffice to say that I have a small child who I'm the primary caretaker for, and the unexpected appearance of the coronavirus in my life has meant that he's no longer going to preschool, and we're being more cautious with his grandparents, and it's causing a lot of anxiety, which inevitably leads to depression. I live in the United States, and have been waiting and watching the numbers go up since early on, when a friend on Facebook who live in Wuhan began talking about what was happening there.

  Similarly, I live in Minnesota, and have spent a fair amount of time in the Twin Cities for one reason or another, with a lot of friends and family there, and the protests, and riots ... the world is feeling particularly oppressive at the moment, and the coming American election has me expecting the worst and wishing that I lived in less interesting times, or at least in a less interesting country.

  So writing has been slow. I've been anxious and depressed. The days have been blurring together, and I'm putting a lot of my little remaining willpower into being a good father and a good husband. I sit down in front of the computer to write, and get a couple sentences in before my mind wanders, or I get depressed by the stuff that I'm writing on top of where my mind has been. I took an internet sabbatical, but that didn't really help much.

  (I want to say that the last week or so has been better, but it's really just been more focused anger than anxiety, which is a step up, but not exactly healthy.)

  Anyway, that's the abridged version, I'm sure you have your own travails, and hope you're well. Thanks for the support.

*** Since reading that "Aerb is shaped like a hexagon" is part of the world's common knowledge something has been tickling me. This link prompted me to finally sit down and work through it.

A plane tiled by a hexagon is /also/ tiled by a rectangle, so this fact about Aerb is more of a statement about the conventions of the inhabitants than a statement about geometry. (Barring some extra in-world demarcation of the boundaries).

The following rectangle (in hex coordinates) will do: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0, 0.5, -0.5), (1, 0.5, -0.5). However, it's still not the same as an ordinary grid.

More generally, there are 17 ways to tesselate the plane, each of which has a corresponding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#The_seventeen_groups][wallpaper group]]. Aerb's tessellation corresponds to the group p1.

Tessellations of this type are characterized by a pair of translation vectors. For the ordinary grid the vectors are equal length and perpendicular to each other, so we can draw a map on a square and the edge will line up. With Aerb it wouldn't - the translations are offset by thirty degrees. To tile the plane using our rectangle we'd need to shift rows over in a brick wall pattern.

But a parallelogram doesn't have that problem. A parallelogram aligned with the translation vectors would tile the plane cleanly.

To quote:

#+begin_quote
  But doesn't it work equally well to map Aerb as an infinitely tiling offset grid of rectangles with ratio 3/2:√3?

  Yes. And yes, this is easier to fit on a conventional rectangular map without wasted space. However, there are two considerations here. The first is that if you make a map that just shows a rectangle, the offset means that your map needs additional information about where you end up if you go north, south, etc. Going north on the right half of the map means that you end up in the south of the left half of the map, but going north on the left half of the map means that you end up in the south of the right hand of the map. You could maybe make up for this with color-coding the edges, but it's kind of ugly, and doesn't result in good distance calculations. Second (and this is long-standing Word of God, canonized in "A Brief Description of Aerb"), Aerb fits more neatly into a hexagonal shape than a rectangular one. In other words, you can fit all the major and minor landmasses in a hexagonal shape without cutting anything off, but you can't do the same with a rectangular map.

** I enjoyed these chapters a lot. They definitely had a bit more of a bite to them than the last batch, but that's not bad.

There were some great costs to the battle, but probably the thing that has me most on edge are some of the character relationships. The last conversation with Raven didn't end great, and the batch ends on the note that most of the characters didn't have much to contribute in the dragon fight. And the solace thing, wow, I have no idea what to make of that.

(Incidentally, the fights where everybody is contributing are tons of fun, so I do hope we still get more of those. Still waiting for a Juniper/Raven team-up.)

We also end on the note of this 'call of the gold', although it's unclear that Juniper will be able to hold onto gold magic much longer no matter what he does, and he can always just choose to lose the power. But somehow, I suspect the world will set things up so that it always seems tempting to keep it going just a little while longer.

Essentialism is gone, and that was a huge driver of the story for a lot of it, but I think it's great that we'll get to focus on some other things.

- I like that AW isn't afraid to have "numbers go down" (i.e., take major OP powers away).
- I wonder if they'll be able to find the location it's excluded to? If so, they'll get some limited use out of it back. But it might be more interesting if they can't.
- Soul magic is so uncommon, that there probably won't be a lot of knock-on effects. Although, tattoo magic supposedly had a lot of knock-on effects, but our cast actually hasn't really had to deal with them (kind of disappointing, now that I think about it).
- And honestly, it makes a lot of sense if AW's/DM's plan is to force Juniper to blow through some OP powerset when it becomes absolutely necessary, then make him pick something different for the next one.

Never imagined this would be the reason they go to Celestar. I did like the explanation for why all their stuff survived catastrophe.

Tommul attacking out of nowhere and causing the exclusion to happen earlier was an absolutely hilarious move.

Appreciate that AW has the balls to talk shit about his own magic system in-story. (TBH, I'd sort of thought the same thing about gold magic myself.)

The elevator monologue was funny for some reason. The scene setting was good (I dunno, just the image of them standing there going down listening to this super-monologuey monologue was great) and their interjections were funny too.

I love the idea of them prepping for some big zombie fight and then finding they have to deal with a humanitarian crisis instead. Hope we get more of it in the coming chapters.

Emphasis to the "in-story" part of that though. Juniper is not omniscient, and while to him Gold Magic's abilities might be poorly connected to its requirements, it seems highly likely (at the very least at the Doylist level) that gold magic's actual ability is "go hand-to-hand against a Dragon matching its strengths " - in which case the requirement "have a large hoard of gold" makes a whole lot of sense.

** So I've had some big picture thoughts after rereading portions and rereading old comments, a few of them are actually pretty relevant to these new chapters. There are some interesting ideas in old comments that haven't been discussed much yet...

- So Uther's knight are all twist on characters that his friends had role played. What if Fel is Seed meant to be Juniper's character? Like is Uther went on a quest to find/meet Juniper and met Fel Seed in a horrifying display of DM sadism?

- Uther's experience with meta-narrative seems different than Juniper's. Juniper assumes his is correct since he met the DM but what if there is some broader meta-phenomena driving it? Like if “narrative” is actually a unique pseudo-magic that got concentrated in Uther (possibly by Vervain?) and personified by the Juniper in the form of a DM (kindred souls)? The conversation with Perisev fits this theory pretty well. It seem like Amaryllis and other interested in Uther would have considered this possibility but if it was subtle and ineffable and spread out before Uther maybe they missed it. In this case, the climax with meeting Uther is going to be some very reasoning on what the meta rule about the narrative actually is.

- Related theory to the above two... Fel Seed is a result or an element of Uther's attempt at meta-narrative manipulation, perhaps to stop the heightening escalation, or to create a story that traps him and draws up a new protagonist (to meet Juniper?), or some other purpose....

- This chapter added some more fuel to the Solace DMPC fire. I'm hoping it's just resentment over being coped up a bottle for centuries.

And some thoughts on these latest chapters:

- Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is horrible, but not implausibly so... I'm reminded of the absolute worst of the most extreme “libertarian” thought that engages in apologia for child labor and selling yourself into slavery and such.

- Amaryllis's religious studies are surprisingly accurate in predicting the DM. I would go so far as to count this toward evidence that the DM and meta-narrative aren't quite what Juniper thinks they are.

- Once Juniper naturally levels soul Scaphism, all sorts of degenerate abuse would be possible with a good logistical system to collect souls. So the exclusion isn't too unreasonable (especially if the DM only excluded soul Scaphism). But excluding all of soul magic seems excessive. Furthermore people will notice Juniper is now involved in 2 exclusions leading to problems. But the zone might not be on Poran since they couldn't get into their souls while there.

- How does the DM expect them to win these ridiculously high level fights without abusing the system? It seems like evidence against Junipers conception of the DM and more in favor of Uther's perception.

- I am sure there won't be any large scale consequences for devastating Celestar... (I bet Elves will notice even from Aerb).

I think it's more about learning how to let go and move on. By procedurally excluding the magics that Juniper learned to break, we get to see a story about a person who perpetually needs to update strategies in order to survive.

It seems like most of the people we've encountered with soul magic are the exact /wrong/ people we would want to have soul magic, and I'm not sure that a marginal benefit to our protagonist outweighs all of the probable abuse happening behind the scenes. (Especially when Joon ends up being able to solve his problems anyways, just using other means.)

In fact, it seems like a lot of exclusions are put in place solely in order to prevent what might otherwise be major threats to civilization as a whole. The price of survival is letting go of everything that's hinders that survival.

I think there's also an argument here about Joon and Amaryllis using Essentialism as a crutch to solve their relationship issues. I think that they're going to grow more through dealing more directly with their problems. It's like, the world didn't end when Farming magic was excluded.

Even the locus might be unable to take him back from Celestar, because all of the greenery there is fake and orderly, undying because it isn't alive in the first place.

  In theory, the call of the gold would be able to tell me where my gold was, but part of the reason that I was being asked to do this was so that I'd have a way, way harder time getting this gold back if I ever broke the compact. The least I could do was to acquire a few landmarks in case I needed to return without the help of gold.

** I guess my biggest question with Captain Blue is, why?

Why keep going with the zombie procedure and even do worse things over time (selling children's souls to the hells, where it's unclear what he actually got in exchange).

What's actually driving him to do this? Why isn't he happy to retire with a small population of zombies/humans in his EZ? It seems like he's driven to keep expanding and growing his economy, and feels like he's forced into making lots of horrible tradeoffs because of this. But these tradeoffs are totally not required! He could've just not expanded! I feel like what drives him to continue on could've been better explored. My best guess is simple pride, he wants to rule over a rich and powerful polity, and feels like that was taken away for him because of other people's hypocrisy.

I'm also confused about all the extra labour zombies he has underground. If he kills the children and sells their souls then surely they can't be made into zombies? So where do the new zombies come from? The few conscientious objectors?

Captain Blue was evil enough to have a lot of enemies who want him to suffer horribly, at which point "live out your retirement" might no longer be on the table.

By "educate" was Uther really considering something more like human-value-aligned Dragon upbringing? Then Raven's meaning is that the problem with the plan was that it wouldn't work, not its morality.

Or maybe Juniper just thinks this is such a flimsy reason to give up on a plan? Additionally, he may suspect motivated cognition.

** I took notes while doing a reread between the last posted set of chapters and now, and then condensed those notes down at work last night when I noticed the document said this batch was being posted today. Posting these before I read the new batch (which I will do tonight at work); I'll edit this if anything ends up being addressed.

- Random pieces of worldbuilding serve to disguise Chekhov's Guns---any number of things could come back up again, but almost definitely not /everything/. Numerous examples of this throughout the story, but the one that made me think about this was Raven's mention of bloodline attacks, which are excluded, but given how many other excluded magics have been mentioned it's hard to know whether it will be used (like illusion magic) or not used (like frost magic, probably).
- Tree magic doesn't exist. In-universe, Aerb!Joon came up with all of this stuff and put it into a game, and just happened to be surprisingly correct about stuff like Library Magic, Spirit, and the Monk superclass. Tree Magic is something he came up with but didn't use, and it doesn't actually exist. In fact, given the recent mention of Joon making "new magic" like Arthur did, it's possible this is Tree Magic, which would bring up a lot of interesting questions about predestination.
- The number five comes up a lot, with some notable examples being: five dream skewered (other than Arthur and Joon), five gods, five forerunner races (that Raven knows of), and the five rune forges. What if these are all connected? The five gods (Mango, Armada, PPMD, Hungrybox, and Mew2King) are the only remaining members of the five forerunner races (endlings). They created/oversee the rune forges, and in an effort to emulate the DM they also brought people over from Earth to act as their champions (like Arthur), but weren't able to replicate the Knack or any of the game elements.
- Of the Jubjub bird, Pallida said "I'm pretty sure that a five hundred foot tall bird would stick out like a sore thumb." Now I'm really curious where the Jubjub bird is hiding in plain sight, because that's too good a setup, but I can't think of anything that could be it.
- The value of "level up" was lowered too much, and that effects the extent to which Joon is willing to prioritize it, even though leveling up is still really useful. It was said to be lowered to "rock bottom", which implies neutrality/negative feelings towards it, which isn't the best idea. I'm honestly surprised Amaryllis hasn't brought this up already (although it's possible she did off-screen).
- Arthur made the same deal with Perisev that Joon did---stories from Earth, retrieved via an entad, in exchange for increased goodwill on her part. It would explain why she knew Arthur was dream skewered, and her question about whether Joon would use "the same entad that Uther had". Contemplated not including this note since it seems very obvious.
- Amaryllis is going to be turned into a zombie, and she might just die afterward. Her story arc is done, Joon had a conversation with Grak where he was like "I should get over myself and tell her that I love her" which means that definitely won't happen, and the party is now incredibly powerful with all of the items she's providing them. Honestly the smartest thing to do might even be for Joon to respec Charisma and become the face of the party so she can stay somewhere safe and guarantee they keep their items, but that would either fuck with the narrative and the DM would kill her anyways or Mary would /argue/ that's what would happen and they would decide not to do it. This is likely already addressed in the new batch, so edit incoming.
- "She had everything, we had nothing, and she wouldn't share", per Star Doris. While there's a roughly 50% chance that any clone would be descended from either, it's perfectly fitting for Doris that the very first clone she made would have killed the original to get her stuff.

The "singularity" obsessed elves managed to build a perfect garden. Not: "Perfect according to Elf Standards". Actually perfect. They then discovered that the contrast between the garden and their own, by comparison, imperfect selves was intolerable. They could not bring themselves to /unmake/ the garden, either, so they all left so they could stop thinking about it.

And any young elf who takes up gardening gets very frosty stares until they give up on that idea.

So why do all those expeditions disappear? Because nobody who is not an elf can bring themselves to leave. Or bring themselves to tell the world, since it becoming a tourist destination would obviously damage it. So all the space travelers who get there defect and stay.

** Really enjoyed this set of chapters.

This batch made me adjust upwards some of my ideas about how significant it is that Juniper's relevance to the party is very much mediated by the fact that he's the source of ungodly supernatural power.

For Amy in particular, first and foremost, Juniper matters because he's a 'lever by which the world can be moved'. Enjoying her relationship with him to the extent that she does is secondary to the extent that it isn't helping her to utilize him as a lever to move the world, which is her ultimate priority. I choose to believe her when she said she would 'smash his head in with a hammer' to keep her world alive, and her loyalty to him is contingent on that being what helps her to keep her world alive.

What I'm saying is, Juniper really is to a large extent merely the conduit for the power that he represents. What this means though, is that if she thinks that acting at cross purposes to Juniper is worth it to achieve what truly matters to her, she will do it. And Juniper, for all the power he has amassed, has a big SOC shaped hole by which he can be manipulated and deceived. I don't think his party is above taking advantage of that, and the more WTC I read the more I get the sense that there is a lot of it being gestured at, in big ways and small. Maybe I'm reading too much into the significant looks that party members give to each other in the text and other hints of that kind, but while Juniper is playing his game, the others are occupied more than anything with simply trying to keep a handle on him and best nudge him in their preferred direction, something that only becomes more true the more powerful he gets individually and the more unilateral control he gets.

hashed predictions based on this batch:

*** Let me guess , you were also on the train of people that thought Mary soulfucked Joon?

There is a portion of WtC's readership that share the view that " Juniper really is to a large extent merely the conduit of power he represents" for his party (and especially Amy). The problem is that you are largely evaluating their situation as the Chosen One and his companions in a vacuum , while mostly ignoring how their individual interpersonal relationships and their significance might impact that situation.

For Amy in particular , that view was absolutely true... in like the first 1-2 books of WtC. She was pretty blatant about it too , even Juniper picked up on it immediately. Around the time they traveled through the Datura Desert (when Amy sprained her ankle and Juniper carried her on a sled) , she began by her own admission to have feelings for him. I don't particularly care going into more detail , since the developments that have transpired since that point in the story are many , considering its length , but it has become fairly obvious that her loyalty to Juniper ( which sits 26 by this point , only behind Val's , for whom Juniper is pretty much the pillar of her existence) is in no way "contingent on that being what helps her keep her world alive" and is deeply personal. The conversation June and Amy had right after Rosemallow's murder all but says it outright.

​

As for the rest of the party and your belief that they are not above manipulating him through his obvious SOC deficiencies , they are personally loyal to him in pretty much the same way , with the exception of Raven, whose precedent to the situation is the complete lack of influence she could exert on Uther who pretty much always acted unilaterally . Even if they were not loyal , Bethel wouldn't care at all , it's not Grak's style and the Locus is the Locus. Val as it stands is certainly not above manipulating Juniper , but it's pretty much strictly in what she believes will ''benefit" him in her often misguided way , and that manipulation is limited to small interpersonal matters.

**** Is it insensitive to feel that your depressed headspace might've made the desolation in these chapters more...palpably wretched? I can't remember what the method acting equivalent of writing is, if there is one. I think a lot of us are feeling small and trapped in the slipstream of our times, but (pardon the ouroboros) taking a page out of Joon's pad, the less-than-eudaimonic reality and wicked problems of the world are things we have to confront sooner or later to grow, adapt, and overcome. Even if reading about shit mountains is eliciting escapist or vicarious narrative dissonance, literature occasionally serves to push us out of our Comfort zones and it's still much gentler than life. The timing and serial format are unfortunate, but it's not like WtC ever catered to wish fulfillment anyway.

BTW thanks for introducing ludonarrative dissonance; it's such a great fit in the litRPG context. A degree of reasonableness and it moonlights as a critique of the litRPG genre: it reminds me of the friction between "roleplaying" and "game", the disconnect between narrative and game elements, and the reader's malaise as the tool grows so large that its gravity distorts plot and meaning. Throw a few more degrees and it's an iffy metaphor for life - that storified delusion/feeling that we're meant to do something, but the mechanics of circumstance dictate otherwise (or theoretical vs practical). So all's to say no surprise on the fiction-is-better-than-reality crowd.

Thanks for the chapters and hope you're finding simple pleasures!

** I've recently been dissatisfied with the story because it has gotten sloppy about how narrative is applied and is mixing it into the writing directly. There used to be three layers going on:

1. The physical reality of the physical world of Aerb
2. What the DM is weaving on a narrative sense
3. What is actually going on when Joon takes action in the world (the written story we all read)

It feels like the story is breaking down between layer 2&3 and being written as if there is no longer a distinction. The DM can control the setting, but he is not controlling if Joon decides to pick up a void pistol and blow his brains out, however the story is being written /as if the DM is controlling that/.

There's been half a dozen bullshit encounters against insurmountable combat threats in a row: Mome, Captured, Onion, Shia, Doris, Blood God Doris, a million zombies, and 2xDragons. The author knows that Joon will be fine at the end of the fights because he's writing it. Joon will do whatever he can to survive. But the DM isn't acting rationally because it's nonsense to expect the players to invent a new 'bag of holding in a portable hole ICBM' and then keep doing that five times in a row. It's even more nonsense to punish them for it when you planned it in the first place.

What was the DMs intended resolution having two dragons attack Joon? Did he plan for Joon to invent some new bullshit and get excluded? Did he not plan and just assume Joon would die? Or was he not involved at all?

I'm trying to give the story the benefit of the doubt, and the only sensible conclusion that I can come up with is that layer 2 is now gone. The DM isn't scaling encounters because he's not there; fights are going off the rails because dominos he set up a while ago are now colliding in imbalanced ways without him there to nudge things or are part of the setting of the world (eg exclusions). Hence a dragon cutting off diplomacy and going bloodlusted when there is zero way for the party to fairly defeat her.

If that's the case though, it's frustrating because Joon doesn't even bring up the possibility (eg layer 1 is disconnected). If the world is running on a new paradigm that's DM-less or at least functionally so, then Joon needs to adapt. If encounters aren't being scaled to difficulty anymore then Joon needs to go grind on skeletons or something* until he's not needing to risk party wipes and exclusions every single encounter. It's not something he'd allow if he were DM'ing but either he's not DM'ing anymore or he's DM'ing badly and that layer of the story no longer makes sense.

**** A DM can put a party up against an insurmountably more powerful foe once or twice and expect them not to fight. A DM can't reasonably run a 6 month campaign where there is nothing but insurmountable foes and expect the party to never fight if the majority of their skills are combat. And most of those were forced moves or had reasonable expectations of combat. You flip a coin 10 times, it's going to come up heads at least once, and in these cases heads was always "Joon needs to cheat or there's a total party wipe."

Keep in mind that the party /didn't/ fight more than half of the insurmountable combat encounters: 2xDragons the first time, the army of Doris Finch, Blood God Doris, or the millions of Blue's zombies. That is much more pacifist than I'd expect any tabletop group to be.

Hell, take /this chapter's encounter/. Perisev waited at the exit of the dungeon when she attacked the party. If the DM was pulling the levers, then it was his decision to make when he had a dragon start an impossible combat. It's not like the party ran at her swinging swords. Then when they were busy /not/ fighting the dragon, their travel was interrupted with a different dragon. If there's any DM hand in these events, it's pushing them into these encounters well above their level.

***** Well I feel personally attacked right now, because "avoiding combat" and "introducing insurmountable threats you don't expect the party to face" are both things that I do in my (generally well-received) DnD campaign. That being said: if they had been sufficiently afraid of Perisev they could have killed Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle like she demanded they do. Instead they were willing to deny her, to her face, because they thought they could beat her. Same with Onion, in-fact: Joon demanded a trial by combat, despite knowing Onion's reputation, because he thought he could beat anyone they put him up against. It's not the DM's fault that Joon is confident.

Plus, for a lot of those encounters, they didn't need "bag of holding in a portable hole ICBM" solutions. They did for Mome Rath, Onion, and Tommul, although it's uncertain what other options they had, since they just jumped to these incredibly powerful methods because they knew they could do them. But they otherwise used things like Spirit, Gold Magic, void, and warding.

Hell, take /this chapter's encounter/. They used a bullshit solution to try to deal with Perisev and it didn't work, and then they resorted to using the Egress despite knowing they had the dragons' attention and that it would likely attract attention, forcing them to waste Scaphism and Meta Stilling on Tommul---this honestly seems deliberate on the DM's part. Then for Perisev, Joon used Gold Magic and void bombs, two of the earliest things introduced in the story, which he could have done from the beginning instead of having to resort to exclusion-worthy tactics.

What do you actually suggest Joon should have done otherwise with Onion?\\
Onion is a person with a reputation for killing people and he'd just broken a truce at a neutral meeting to drug/rob/torture/imprison Juniper and then told Juniper that he'd murder him and flay him alive. Juniper could either challenge him to a duel, get captured by the baliffs, or have him and all party members become outlaws chased by Anglecynn. With /any/ of those options Juniper would have to face just as hard or harder odds.

Either the DM didn't set it up. Or he did set it up and gave the players nothing but bad options and then punished them for choosing Bad Option A instead of equally Bad Option B or C, which is bad DMing.

#+begin_quote

No, they were still talking when she decided to get unreasonable and go for combat.

Captain Blue-in-the-Bottle is himself a high level threat with millions of zombies. In some alternate world where Joon agrees to Perisev right there /within earshot of the zombies/, we just get to have this conversation again about them being against imbalanced impossible combat except this time it's dealing with millions of zombies.

(And notably, we should assume that antagonists aren't stupid. Perisev went and got support from the other dragon because she's not stupid. Captain Blue had one of his literally millions of followers free him because he's not stupid.

And no, /I can't know for sure/ that multi-billionaire genius Captain Blue had a contigency plan. But in an alternate world, we'd be arguing that Joon shouldn't have fought 10 million zombies and should have just talked to Perisev and /we can't know for sure/ that she would have cut off diplomacy and attacked.)

Situations are occurring where there is no option except for combat into impossible scenarios. That is either a bad DM or the DM isn't setting up situations anymore.

Lacking the help of these party members, he so out-classed his last adversary that he won despite having what appeared to be his most powerful ability excluded. It took creativity, sure, but as noted he's been pretty consciously saving "becoming a gold mage" for a rainy day this entire time. It was also shown with Blood God Doris that even when given an explicit quest to destroy an enemy, there is room for alternate paths and compromise. Here he didn't even have a quest to kill these dragons, and there might very well have been paths he could have taken to avoid the fight.

*** Joon is a level 19 adventurer at this point. By D&D standards, he /should/ be facing off against threats that are basically unrealistically powerful. The problem is at least partially how poor his build is - if he actually had a good build, focused on a single stat or having brought a single skill up to max, he would be fine. Even better if it's pseudomagic like Bladebound or something meme-y like Woodworking, which he got rid of. It's a modern RPG, there's no grinding needed, but you still need to stick to your build, not go for a Wizard/Fighter mix with two levels in Rogue and expect to perform to the same level of combat in a game that's intended to be 'hard'/is scaled around your munchkining.

If he was a bladebound and focused purely on bladebound abilities and the related physical abilities, he could feasibly have been at Onion's level in a one-on-one fight by the time he reached Onion. Onion was at least partially bad luck/limitations and a forced chance to test physical combat, because Joon's build has otherwise gone fairly heavily into the magic route, but even with his 100x learning speed or whatever, time that he spent taking water magic to level 20 could've gotten Vibrational or Still magic up an extra ~5-10 levels for a permanent virtue. Ink Magic is probably up to ~30+ at this point and has had a couple nice knicknacks but mostly duds, but maybe that'll turn around in the future.

I think Soul Magic exclusion helps. He was 100% abusing it and he certainly got to have his fun with it before it was slapped down. The single other earlygame OP tool that's still being overused to this point is the unicorn bone. I almost feel as though if he achieved Meta-stilling 'normally' at skill level 100 (which has been the driving force behind both exclusions), with Scaphism normally at skill level 80 or Kenner's Eye through his own work on Tattoo magic and Art, they wouldn't have been excluded.

Also, at the end of the day, he did bust out Gold Magic and has at least ~two other OP options to use (Runes, other memetics), plus the power of friendship (aka Blood God Doris or Bethel). I'm really thinking that messing with rune exploits will cause an exclusion, which then means being forced to tackle the hells. He'll also be "allowed" to use Gold Magic at least once more, and there are a host of other magic abilities to pickup or treasure troves to find through his existing quests. He could choose to stock up on other creative options- not that Soul Magic was bad, but I felt it was at the point of overstaying its welcome considering how OP it was and how it felt like it was able to solve basically any situation. And he didn't even use his companions in this fight, so anything that used them would've been a fair expectation from the DM. Most PCs don't solo a dragon at their level, they do it in a party or 4-6 adventurers.

Finally, it was their choice to oppose Perisev, and it shouldn't have been a surprise that they'd need to consider going up against a dragon and prepare the necessary tools or resources.

**** Joon should be stat capped for most relevant combat skills which is due to his level, because skills are locked to 3xPrimary or 5xSecondary stats.

If Joon was going all-in onto a grouped stats like phys, level 18 would get him to 22 in a group of 3 stats (40pts counting IIRC a +2 stat point boon he got, which would leave all other stats at 2 except luck at 0). Assuming he managed to get stats that all had both primaries and secondaries in the same stat group, he'd be capped at 66 for any of those.

If Joon were to dump all stat points into a single stat then try to pump up the secondary stat to match, he could reach 27/17 in a single primary/secondary stat, which would only let him get up to 81 in a single skill.

In comparison, Onion was at least level 100 in Parry and One-Handed (which are SPD and POW primaries respectively). If Juniper wanted to copy Onion's build and exclusively rush to just Parry and One Handed, he'd have to be level 41 at the /minimum/ and Joon speculates that his skill is even higher than that. At the very minimum, Onion is over double Joon's current level and was probably closer to 3x his level at the time of the fight.

I don't think any level of optimization would help Joon overcome these challenges aside from exploits (which get excluded).

How moral do you have to be to put the effort he has gone to? Think about it from his perspective for a moment and consider the insane efforts he went to to justify his work. Consider any actual real world situation, has any business mogul ever gone to this effort? No of course not. He must be spending billions on what is basically charity work that gets him no tax credits and no benefits from good will.

1. His position won't convince anyone.

This guy has decided to murder kids at 8. He must know that no one would be convinced that this is moral. So why bother doing it? Why not just kill them the moment they develop a soul? He spent billions of dollars and seriously massively ruined his own business for no benefit at all.

It would have been far more efficient if he didn't make people sign contracts that no one accepts as justified. So why did he do that?

1. No one will ever know about anything he did.

This guy did not plan to be discovered or have to surrender. In fact considering how he organised (or rather lack of) he doesn't even care that much about legacy if he suddenly died all of his paperwork and the such would have been useless. His sudden planning for this surrender shows that he did not prepare for any possibility that he would be dead. Therefore he never intended to share any information with the world. Most people, you, me and everyone else, are moral in large part because of social pressures. When we're in different societies, even different groups, our morality shifts. But this guy has literally no one pressuring him to conform to social moral standards. So why would he bother?

1. We are given no reason to doubt him.

You might say perhaps there is another reason why he waits to 8, why he bothers educating or getting consent but we're given no reason in text to doubt him and if anything it's verified via the crown.

--------------

So from his perspective instead of becoming a multi trillionaire murdering babies before they're out the womb, enslaving vast numbers of people without any threat of recourse and profiting far more he increases his cost of business by THOUSANDS of percentages for NOTHING?!?! So he can feel that he's justified in his position?!

It's insanity! Show me any IRL capitalist who has gone to this efforts. IRL capitalists worked against labour laws, they only give to charity for the tax benefits and social capital. This guy has given more to charity (and real unrequited charity with zero benefits for him outside of his psychology) than any other human in existence on this world (maybe apart from Arthur).

Imagine going to the effort of making studies and making education programs. He could have just waited until they were 18 or 100 or whatever and then sold their soul right? After all he's already made it clear that he's willing to give up profit for morality. So that means that he was genuinely convinced by his studies that his test he devised is genuine and 8 year olds can prove consent at this age. It means that he genuinely thinks people can give up their autonomy in a contract. And yet he's still choosing the minimum

Seriously it blows me away just what a good guy he is trying to be. You might think your moral but IRL practice shows that if you can save 1 trillion dollars by reducing the age of the test to 7 years old or 1 year old every capitalist will do it. But this guy fucking resisted that massive temptation. Not for PR, not for tax credits, but for his own morality?

It's impossible to believe someone can be this good and also still run the business he is running.

Every day he must be faced with yet another problem about contracts or about feeding millions of children and realise that yet again this is entirely self imposed regulation. And with no threat of someone coming in to regulate him. Again as far as I know this has no real world example, businesses only regulate themselves to stop the government making a regulatory body.

** Until the latest exclusion, there was a hope of finding the places where various bits of soul magic were excluded to and using them. Now, if the soul magic exclusion is in a different location, does that mean those exclusion zones won't work?

Possible workaround if the DM willed it so:

On different planes, the soul magic exclusion overlaps with different pieces of excluded soul magic. So now you can only use Gestalt in a certain part of the plane of blood, can only change your species in a certain part of the plane of chitin, etc.

But there are also already other mini-soul magic exclusions for individual aspects of it, i.e. we already know that Manifest's exclusion likely had something to do with soul magic.

Also, it'd be kind of silly to take away what was basically an overpowered hammer, just to let him find some trove where he can use it to fully reoptimized, respec his character sheet to get rid of the "new" dump skills (i.e. gold magic, eventually), etc. It might be cool if it was some middle of nowhere place, though, if it allows him to do something like yolo with Analysis or Engineering to produce plans/create something that he or Mary can execute on afterwards, rather than combat skills in the moment.

Obviously Joon is going to replace Solace as the Last Druid.

I like that Essentialism is excluded. That was a huge Damocles' sword above the team's heads and skill sacrifice + scaphism was pushing Joon into a diminishing-returns arms race with every new challenge he faced. Hopefully we will see less munchkinry, more playing to their actual skills + specificities and especially *more teamwork*.

I think Elisha Blue's quest stands ultimately as a way to force Joon to question the ethics and author responsibility with his designing Aerb the way he has, by putting an emphasis on the ongoing and HUGE issue of the Hells. The captain essentially is wedging himself in between his victims and the crapsack nature of Aerb, in order to coerce them ‘consensually' by ensuring existence itself constrains their choice to what he ‘offers'. The only way Joon is getting out of this satisfactorily is by designing better alternative existences for the victims and therefore for everyone in Aerb.

** Am I the only one who thinks that the way Six-Eyed Doe sees Solace might not actually mean anything negative? Imagine an old woman walking alongside a horse, and the old woman has a rope tied around the horse's neck. What's their relationship like? A single rope isn't going to meaningfully restrain a horse the way a bridle or harness would; all it would do is guide the horse the way the woman would want it to go. If the horse did try to run, it would probably just yank the rope out of her hand. You wouldn't see this being done unless both the horse and rider trusted each other. In terms of Solace and the locus, seeing Solace that way could just mean that Solace is weak without the locus's power, but the locus is willing to lend the power to be used as Solace wants because they trust and take care of each other.

** Mildly obnoxious objection that occurred to me about an hour after reading: Amaryllis has Synergy, so she has half of Joon's skill levels, right? And Joon, as of the moment he's flying into Celestar, has at least 13 in Gold Magic, which puts Mary at 6. Now, she doesn't "own" an actual giant heap of gold at that point, so you could argue that her skill is irrelevant, but Joon has a virtue, courtesy of the Doe, that allows him to fudge technicalities, and that seems like the kind of technicality that really deserves a fudging. Unless you argue that six-eyed only applies to Joon personally trying to BS the DM on his own behalf, which I think goes somewhat against the spirit of it.

Bottom line, I think Mary had a fair case for being allowed to fly up and stab Perisev a little bit, even if it would be just like the DM to only consider her to "own" half the gold pile.

I could see any number of annoying limitations being built in by the DM, like forcing Mary to assist Joon in appeasing his goldbug, or her effective hoard limit being half as big, but requiring her to have her own hoard would be effectively impossible since it would turn her and Joon against each other.
