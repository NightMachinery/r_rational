Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** There is a common magic trick of pulling a coin out from behind someone's ear. This is usually done by hiding a coin in your hand first, then reaching out to the back of someone's ear before revealing the coin in your hand.

You on the other hand, have the magical ability to do this trick for real. An actual coin magically appears in your hand whenever you do this trick, under certain conditions:

- The coin that appears is a duplicate of a coin you have on your person when you perform the trick.
- You can only do this once to each person.
- The coin must be small enough to have reasonably been hidden somewhere within your hand during the trick.
- Once your hand is behind a person's ear and out of sight of any observer, the coin will appear within your hand in a place where it could reasonably have been hidden in.

What can you do with this power?

*** So, you can duplicate a coin, once per person, as a magic trick.

I'd probably figure this out by using my friends and family up, especially if it's only one trick per person. I'd try to obtain a gold coin to duplicate, for money. The original gets returned to whoever I borrow from, and i use the new coin to duplicate further. Gold isn't the most valuable material, but it would be valuable enough to purchase a platinum coin, which is more expensive. Platinum is valuble, but not the /most/ valuable, so I'd shoot for making a coin out of either rhodium, ruthenium, or iridium, whatever turns out to be the most expensive.

With a 1oz coin of rhodium, I'd be making 2500$ or so per person. That's enough to just pay people 20$ to show up and have the trick performed on them. Selling off the rhodium at fair market price will likely be the hardest part. Partnering up with a metal recycling company might be a good move.

Make sure to pay my taxes, the IRS will be very interested with my rapid spike in income.

*** I mean, if I have to live in a world where there's an actual requirement of min/maxxing (and not just doing the rhodium coin like [[/u/WilyCoyotee][u/WilyCoyotee]] mentions), a person could surgically expand their hand so that (after sufficient time, and depending on the power's definition of the word "hand" and some excruciating expanding surgeries or exercises) a person could load a large backpack (possibly not even having to carry it, it could just be attached to them to count as "on their person"), then just about anything that would fit into a certain-sized puck (Probably at least a few feet in diameter) could be duplicated, assuming you nabbed a new person to duplicate it behind.

The power does not limit what exactly you can duplicate, so other powered people that are small enough to squeeze into the puck are a possibility. Generation ships (Arks for restarting humanity elsewhere) just became a lot easier to fuel, with all those people in interstellar space, I get a new puck of fuel--probably plutonium or Uranium, although this is a situation that antimatter may be possible, assuming a loose enough definition of "behind the ear" and "within your hand." (Can antimatter storage be built into my hand, so it appears "within my hand?")Even a few ounces of antimatter per person's lifetime may be enough to fuel the ship indefinitely. Of course, we would have to acquire the antimatter puck to begin with. Alternately, of course, the puck itself could hold the antimatter, so my hand is free to generate other essentials. None of which, however, would generate as much utility based on the constraints as the antimatter.

*** Here's some general ways to munchkin those rules:

Rule 3: Make your hand as large as possible. You can have one hand surgically enlarged to increase the size of the coins. This is likely to have a large quality of life cost though.

Rule 4: Doing it in a enclosed and unmonitored room with the volunteer's eyes closed might let you copy coins that wouldn't fit in your fist. If their eyes are closed the coin could have been "hidden" just by being held in your hand unenclosed.

Crazy ideas:

Get ahold of liquid LSD, put it into a coin and replicate to your max. LSD is extremely value dense if you're willing to sell it, and casually throwing a handful into someone's face is a great non-lethal secret weapon.

Be a supervillain. Get ahold of dangerous substances, coinify them and extort the world. Terrify towns with chemical weapons, threaten the world with pathogens and bioweapons if you can get them. Even relatively safe bacteria can be terrifying if you get exposed to grams of them. A coin throwing villain is terrifying when they're full of gas weapons and anthrax. On your person with nonmetallic coins or them disguised as currency would let you move through security with ease.

Reasonable:

Get rich and make the world rich. Make a ton of rare earth metals so chemical engineers can use catalysts for everything, and computers can be made of gold. Use it on complex alloys, carbon nanotubes, and high temperature superconductors.

Pharmaceuticals: if they can make any amount of their drug you can double it until you're making at least tens of grams of it at a time. This is probably where you can earn and help the most once you're established, some drugs are measured in nanograms so you could be the entire production source for them.

**** I always got the impression that drugs were expensive because of the ludicrous costs of R and D/FDA approval, plus various perverse incentives built into the law that let them jack up the price. Once you've got the means to make some of a drug, there's generally nothing keeping you from continuing to make it, no? You're restricted only by the supply of ingredients. I'm not involved in drug manufacture, mind you, I just work in pharmacy, and as a tech at that.

***** Great point! I have no idea what the gross % profit of drugs per dosage are, I was just thinking of all of the drugs with tiny amounts of AI that have a high consumer cost.

At least this would still be useful for drug testing and rapid production of new drugs. Imagine having a flu vaccine that doesn't need the composition chosen half a year ahead of time, or not requiring manufacturing for drug trials.

Would the trick work on, for instance, a human tissue embed into a coin-shaped case?

Maybe it would be possible to use this method to clone anything that is inside coin-shaped container, even small living insects, etc

** Reverse munchkinry: What powers would you need to achieve a Men in Black situation? You are in charge of a world-spanning organization that is keeping an significant Secret [in MIB aliens routinely visit earth, many live on earth, and earth have access to sci-fi level technology but it could be hidden vampires etc.] successfully hidden from the world population with modern day technology. Obviously you could achieve this if you had an worldwide 'erase memory' power that triggered automatically every time someone suspects that this is indeed the case. What is the lowest OP power or power combination that could realistically achieve this and who/which organizations would at minimum need to be in on this?

Solutions needs to take into account that:

1. How to handle civilians accidentally being affected by the Secret directly and indirectly [seeing a fight between aliens or family suddenly missing]? How do you make sure that you catch all incidents?
2. How to handle dedicated Secret hunters [conspiracy theorists, astronomers, etc.]?
3. How do you handle leaks from within your own organization? Bigger organizations have higher chances of leaks but even small ones might have big enough disagreements.
4. How do you handle the Secret being revealed by technology [microphone, phones, security cameras, satellites, etc.]?
5. How do you handle incidents that happens in heavily populated areas and are really obvious [such as a space tunnel appearing / spaceships appearing, an aliens who you can't afford to offend and who just wanders around downtown, etc.]

Bonus points if you avoid both mind control. Is this even possible without memory modifications?

*** You need powers for this? I'm fairly sure you could solve most of the problems here with money, which you should have plenty of if you're a world-spanning organization. You could probably get away with a whole lot just by spreading false alarms everywhere. Let the snitches and accidental witnesses reveal the recordings of the truth to the public, it will simply be drowned out by a deluge of other "truth"s. Hire lots of actors and costume designers, and regularly make them pretend to be aliens or whatever and claim it is a viral marketing scheme for some movies that you will actually release. Don't focus on making it high quality, its best if the range of quality is all over the place so that the public just thinks you found an exceptionally good actor/costume every once in a while when the truth leaks out.

The only problems you can't cover up this way are disaster-level events. Like if your alien spaceships death ray a city into a pile of molten wreckage, that will be pretty damn hard to hide. But I think in this case you have much much bigger problems.

**** Certainly a solution. I am not fully convinced about the idea of hiding the truth in plain sight though it is plausible that it could work. It seems that it would bring the hypothesis of the Secret being true to the forefront of people's minds when experiencing something immediately unexplainable.

If an alien did something that couldn't be explained by the current technology such as suddenly teleporting, I feel that just running an advertise campaign wouldn't satisfy the confusion of the people who saw it happen.

Well, what is the goal here? Hide the truth from the public? Or hide the truth from literally every person who isn't part of the organization? For the former you don't have to care about the few people who directly saw the teleportation. They are a tiny tiny fraction of the population and few will believe their stories when you flood the world with alternative 'truths' and claim they are viral marketing campaigns when caught.

The latter is pretty much impossible: any traitor on the inside tells a close friend/real boss/whatever and you already failed. You would need some kind of loyalty checking/ensuring power to prevent any kind of defection.

****** The goal is to keep the number of people outside of the organization who knows the Secret low enough that the Secret won't become public knowledge. Don't get me wrong, I think that flooding the media/internet with alternative truth and claim they are part of a marketing campaign is clever and certainly would help reducing the chance of reveal but I think we'd still look at something like a 0.1% annual chance of reveal which isn't quite low enough.

The traitor problem is hardly impossible, you yourself mentioned the loyalty checking/ensuring power. Alternative options is to have them swear a binding oath that they won't reveal the secret to outsiders or install some kind of sci-fi tech that kills them if they make the decision to reveal the secret.

One possible solution to this is to have a False Truth that /doesn't/ match the Real Truth, but /would/ explain many of the observations.

For example, you could make many False Truths regarding the idea of aliens visiting and living on Earth... which makes a great way to hide the Real Truth that the Fae exist, because if anyone sees anything you can ensure that it gets passed off as a marketing campaign for a movie about aliens, and that the Guy Who Saw Something doesn't get believed.

** Through a glitch in the matrix, you are given access to your character creation menu and allowed to modify your base attributes. These are (copied with modification from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(role-playing_games)#Dungeons_&_Dragons][here]]):

#+begin_quote
  *Strength* - measuring physical power -- your ability to exert your muscles during short time periods against substantial resistance when engaging in compound lifts, sprints, etc.

  *Constitution* - measuring endurance & stamina (how quickly you tire from mild-moderate exertion), as well as overall health (e.g. with respect to immune function)

  *Dexterity* - measuring agility, balance, coordination and reflexes; how clumsy you are doing everything from shooting hoops to walking & driving in a straight line to carrying a stack of pizza boxes

  *Intelligence* - measuring your ability to learn and retain information, understand complex systems, and solve nerdy problems

  *Wisdom* - measuring self-awareness, introspection, and the degree to which you recognize your actions hamper to advance your values

  *Charisma* - measuring force of personality, persuasiveness, leadership, and likeability

  *Willpower* - measuring how well you can follow through on commitments, resist akratic urges, and force yourself to do unpleasant things

  *Happiness* - measuring your 'hedonic set point' -- the ease with which you experience positive emotion in response to positive stimuli, your overall degree of contentment and satisfaction with life, etc.
#+end_quote

These are typically measured on 0-10 scale, where your current score corresponds to the percentile of your performance against a demographically corrected baseline (wrt age, sex, etc.). Scores of 0 correspond to being in the 1st percentile and 10 to the 99th, but scores 1-9 to your score*10 percentile (so 1 -> 10th percentile, 5 -> 50th percentile, etc.). Scores outside the 0-10 bounds correspond to increasingly closer fractional percentiles to either bound, with unit scores representing a 10-fold shift in closeness (so a score of 11 puts you in the 99.9th percentile, 12 in the 99.99th percentile; -1 in the 0.1th percentile, -2 in the 0.01th percentile, etc.). Scores more extreme than anything found in existing human populations measure you against arbitrarily large populations summed across parallel earths featuring comparable, but independently rolled individuals (so a score of 20 would roughly put you at 'best out of 125 parallel earths').

Upon accessing this panel, you find that you can increment and decrement your scores as desired, but their sum cannot exceed the sum of scores that currently corresponds to you. Your finite set of points are currently allocated and can be re-allocated, that's all. Upon exiting the menu, the machine rulers of the matrix bar your further access to it, also wiping your memory of ever having changed anything. Your body and mind are otherwise altered to be consistent with your new attributes as elegantly and with as few changes as possible, and your total 'historical expenditures' towards altering each attribute are preserved (so e.g. if you're an elite strongman and dump strength, you get the body of someone who's trained just as thoughtfully and diligently as you have, but is nevertheless not at the 99.9th percentile but at the 0.01th, or whatever. So no 'reapplying' yourself and getting them gains just as easily as your first go around).

How do you change your 'current scores' and why?
