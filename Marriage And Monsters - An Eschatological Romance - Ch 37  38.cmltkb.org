*** Silvertongue is the surname of Lyra, also from His Dark Materials like Asriel. I'd presume that is the reference over something else

** I'm only starting to read this story, and am currently up to chapter 9. It's great!

I've had some thoughts about how pathfinder-like the dragon really is, however. Here is a pathfinder [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/metallic-gold/gold-dragon-wyrmling/][Gold Dragon Wyrmling]] for convenient comparison, and here is [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FLGa6p-1SvIwfvgw91_FK34411GWkJFfl-aQtoN5zAo/edit][Hailey]] as of chapter 6.

Let's start by comparing the base statistics:

- Let's start with ablity scores. Wyrmling has INT 14, WIS 15 and CHA 14, whereas Hailey is rocking 16-14-16 in those stats (Higher intelligence due to being a professor, perhaps, and lower wisdom due to being a professor as opposed to actively saving the world :p). This may not seem like much, but if this was a player character using point-buy, they'd need 50 points to get Hailey's stats, and only 42 to get ones for Wyrmling, for a solid 16% difference.

- Hailey's saves are also higher. Wyrmling has 8 HD and all good saves, for +6 base to all three saves. It gets a further +2 to Fort, Ref and Will from 15 CON, 14 DEX and 15 WIS respectively, as well as another +2 to Will from Iron Will feat, for a total of +8/+8/+10. Hailey, based on her sheet, should have saves of +8/+8/+8, but is instead rocking a mighty +12/+12/+13 with no active items or buffs, for an unknown bonus of +4/+4/+5. Isekai protagonist cheats are truly something.

- Her health is also a bit higher than normal. Normal wyrmling has 65 hp without Toughness, and would have 73 with that feat. Hailey has 85, I presume because her GM gave her full hit die of HP at the first level, and then half of hit die at all other levels, rounded up(that comes up to 85 HP exactly). There are many ways to give HP to players, and this is one of the fairly popular ones, but normal monsters in the monster manual instead get half a hit die worth of HP at each level.

Overall, Hailey's passive abilities are already much better than normal for her dragon type and age category.

Now let's consider her more active abilities.

- Wyrmling dragon has 60ft blindsense. Now, blindsense in pathfinder is a pretty vague sense:

#+begin_quote
  Blindsense lets a creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent that cannot be seen has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.
#+end_quote

- Hailey, on the other hand, seems to have blind/sight/, which is the big brother of blindsense, based on "you can feel events as minuscule as a pin drop up to 60 feet away" (chapter 2). This is typically a very desireable ability in pathfinder, and is normally very difficult to get.

- Hailey has 16 INT, which means she is entitled to being capable of speaking 4 languages /before/ bonus languages granted by the Linguistics skill - Common, which everyone gets, and 3 bonus languages (one for every 2 points of INT above 10). You can see that this is indeed how dragons work by comparing a dragon wyrmling (14 INT, 3 langugaes) to a [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/metallic-gold/gold-dragon-wyrmling/][young dragon]] (16 INT, 4 languages), as well as in general rules on language speaking in pathfinder. Arguably, changing her abilities to reflect this does not require any modifications to the story, as she could gain the ability to speak some other earth languages - Chinese or Spanish, for example - that would not have come up in the story in the first place. Indeed, now that she has put 2 points into Linguistics, she should be capable of speaking 6 languages, and didn't need to waste 1 skill point on learning English (aka Common).

As we can see, Haley isn't quite a normal Pathfinder dragon. I'm curious if these differences have a story reason or if author has simply made a mistake in Pathfinder rules (which are arcane and borderline incomprehensible at the best of times)

It is also interesting to guess what actions Haley could take later to grow her powers in the most optimal manner:

- Going further into skill point allocation, Perception may arguably be a waste of points. Using pathfinder perception rules, noticing a visible creature is DC 0, which is then modified by various modifiers. One of those modifiers is +1 DC/10 ft to the target. This means that, by pathfinder RAW rules, Hailey should not be capable of noticing a person standing in broad daylight from 120 meters away (a little more than a soccer field), because she has +15 to perception, rolls a d20 for a maximum of 35, and 120 meters gives a +39 to perception DC. Since this is not the case, we can assume Hailey operates on more real-life vision mechanics, and so unless putting points into Perception physically makes her eyes better, there is no point in bothering with it. If it does, it's a great skill, and well worth the points.

- What is a definite waste is putting points into Appraise and Heal skills. Appraise has, pretty much, exactly one function - determining the gold value of an object. However, that is a fairly rare and usually unnecesary task, which can be further replaced by hiring an actual appraisal specialist. Furthermore, even if hiring a person for this task is not feasible, doing some basic statistics on the results of several appraisal attempts of roughly equivalent items (e.g. a dozen gems of roughly the same size, type and shape - if they are robbing jewelry stores, those would even be labeled with a price tag attached) should allow you to get a rough dollars - to - gold pieces conversion ratio, which you can then use without relying on the dnd-based dice roll. Wasting magical skill points that can do things like beam knowledge into your head on this is a waste.

- Heal is similar, but at least could make sense as a short-term investment. It is used primarily to stop bleeding and such, which you would think to be useful, but the issue is that it is entirely overshadowed by magical sources of healing. Even 1 point of magical healing is enough to stop bleeding and stabilise someone, which negates the point of the skill. Since Hailey would be getting magic soon, there is little point in investing a lot of points into this.

- A very good investment would be to put 1 skill point into every single Knowledge skill. In Pathfinder, Knowledge skills require "training" to allow you to make rolls on them with higher DC - i.e. your character can't even make guesses about uncommon topics related to that knowledge area without having at least 1 skill point in the relevant knowledge skill. Furthermore, class skill bonus (+3) applies once someone has at least 1 skill point in a skill. This would mean that by putting just 1 skill point into, say, Knowledge(Planes) Haley would go from rolling it at +3 to rolling it at +7 (+3 INT +1 skill point +3 class), quadruple the numerical benefit of a skill point invested into another skill. Furthermore, whatever magic she operates on might allow her to start making guesses related to that field.

- As of chapter 9, Haley is a Very Young gold dragon. This means that she has a spell-like ability of Detect Evil. This may not seem like much, but this grants her much more than just the ability itself - it grants her a /caster level/ equal to her hit dice. Indeed, this should be more than enough to qualify her for Craft Wondrous Item crafting feat, and all the goodness that follows from it. Since in Pathfinder not having access to one of the prerequisites for the crafting of a magical item (e.g. a spell) simply means your crafting DC is increased by 5, this would allow her to start crafting almost any item she wants immediately.

I'll see what changes when I next see her sheet, once she grows more.

** Aural version of the meme! Haley, you've been lucky but you're juggling knives, loaded guns and live grenades, here.
