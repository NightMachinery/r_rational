*** I dropped it in the first couple of chapters for being “unrealistic.” Does it get good later on? Is it rational?

**** Micro review:

I think the author does make some effort to think about things, but people forget about their defined powers one too many times, and much of the prose is taken up with action scenes that don't (per my tastes) demonstrate terribly much in the way of tactics or thought.

There are also a few too many times where people say "well what about this thing, this doesn't make sense" and it's just ... pointed out as not making sense and then dropped? It's a work-in-progress, which means that answers might be coming, but it's still kind of frustrating, and feels like I'm just being told that yes, that thing I noticed doesn't make sense, but the characters also noticed that, so I shouldn't worry about it.

I'm going to keep reading it, partly to see what happens, and partly because there's a consistent creativity to it that I enjoy, even if that creativity sometimes comes at the expense of coherence.

***** I had an entire review written out for this yesterday and somehow it didn't post :-( But the thrust of it mirrored yours. To summarize:

I enjoyed: The slowburning background horror vibe that is really creepy, the creative world building, the descriptions of non-Euclidean physics, the unreliable narrator making me second-guess what is actually happening.

I had mixed feelings about: The characters seem to be trying to figure out how and why the dungeon works as it does, but this hasn't paid off yet. There are some enjoyably shocking plot twists, but they aren't as satisfying due to lack of foreshadowing or buildup (I keep comparing the situation with Sarah to APGTE's demon of Absence and how the latter was handled so much better than the former). And like you remarked, many times something is pointed out as odd, and then dismissed. Sometimes this is plot-relevant, like James taking phone calls but never mentioning from whom or about what, but most times it just seemingly is dropped for no reason. The characters start as "The Everyman and his Indian roommate," but have slowly become more fleshed out and may eventually be a strong point.

I didn't enjoy: The action scenes don't do much for me either. The pacing is really off throughout the whole story; a hint or oddity is teased and then the scene changes and there's no followup. The delves themselves are different each time, but follow a nigh-identical repetition: prep for the delve, enter deungeon, discuss plan, embark, encounter new monster/trap/oddity, get into a fight, overcome but take some injuries that scuttle the original plan, return to entrance, divide up loot. It gets stale after awhile.

I feel overall like the story has some good ideas and an interesting vibe, but the author's writing is a bit weak. That said, it does seem to be improving as it goes, so I'll be catching up with updates as they come out too.

****** My tldr review would also be ‘interesting ideas, weak writing'. I dropped it but there's a pretty wide spectrum on this subreddit in regards to how much poor writing people will put up with for interesting ideas so I think it's worth reading for a number of people here.
