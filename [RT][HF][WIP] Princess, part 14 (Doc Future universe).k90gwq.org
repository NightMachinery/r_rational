** Took a little longer than I wanted, but here is the new chapter 8-). Flicker goes back on patrol, and we hear her origin from her viewpoint. There is a minor continuity change here that will eventually be reflected in Fall and Skybreaker's Call, which I discussed the need for in 'Continuity and Change', linked on the 'Stories' page listed at the top.

Yes, Flicker is the kind of person who apologizes to ants, even giant rampaging ones 8-)

** Did Stella write her thesis on the process of taking down her (presumably corrupt or otherwise Bad) thesis committee? That is... very Stella. I love it:D

*** Oh, yes. And the administration that was covering up their abuses 8-). I originally wrote this in much more detail--but it just wasn't something she could safely discuss with Flicker at this point.

An earlier, non-canon version:

#+begin_example
  "A more informative title would have been 'How to Blackmail Your Thesis Committee.'  Key elements were making sure they were lazy, incautious about reading things before signing them, and possessed an inability to even consider that someone my age and build might have things to teach them about unarmed combat, knives, pressure points, pain, fear, and how to mimic symptoms of food poisoning for long enough for paperwork to clear.  I did worry a bit about assuring an appropriately isolated room for my thesis offense.  I left out the followup on coercing the university adminstration because the methods section would have been awkward, I never intended to publish, and I already had my PhD.  And mostly it was just a matter of preparing thoroughly in advance and getting the timing right.  Certain types of people react very predictably if they think they can get away with concealing a problem.  No extraordinary means of mind control was needed."
  "Um.  How did the students you talked to feel about what happened?"
  "Well, I told them I didn't know about justice, but I would aim for making sure three particular problems were gone, and I would see if I could manage getting their student debt erased too, and I did quite a bit more in both areas.  It wasn't a situation to be happy about, although there was a certain amount of satisfaction when the provost was fired.  He'd told me I'd never work in academia, and I told him neither would he.  He was gone in a month."

** Doc, I don't know if you noticed but the last two or three mentions of your story have been people asking if there's some way to get it other than tumblr. Have you considered crossposting to AO3 or something similar?

*** I have considered it, and I just replied to the most recent post. There are potential issues, and maintaining chapters in more than one place is an administrative nightmare.

I've found nothing kills my motivation to write faster than having to worry about/struggle with website issues, and many web editors do not easily accomodate formatting I consider essential: Paragraphs start with an indented first line and have no extra lines in between, as in a physical book--otherwise short dialog exchanges take up nearly twice the space and the text is more difficult to read. I've had to use a hack on tumblr since they changed their editor that is not generalizeable, and I really don't want to post anywhere that requires reformatting every paragraph after I copy and paste the text from the original files. Keeping the posting process as painless as possible is a priority for continued creativity, and I am concentrating on that for now.

**** Thank you for your thoughtful reply. You don't owe us anything. I will say reading about flicker gives me a lot of joy and I look forward to the day I can pay for a copy.

** Oh, finally. I was worried if you were alright.

Edit: Great chapter!

*** Glad you enjoyed it, and a reasonable worry this year 8-) I'm not really 'alright alright', but I'm '2020 alright' for now. Writing has been slow (most of the pro writers I follow are running at half to a quarter normal productivity), and I found a computer game that provided a much needed mental health diversion.

***** Starsector, with the Nexerelin and Varya's Sector mods (+ a number of minor ones) It's an independant game, not on Steam. I must admit a certain... affinity for the developer perfectionism in a game that has been in 'pre-release' for 8 years (current version in 0.9.1a) 8-)
