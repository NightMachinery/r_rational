** Maybe the initial ships would be wood, but I assume liches would soon enough harness hollowed out asteroids or similar celestial bodies as ships and mobile bases.

Also, at the ridiculous magic power levels mentioned in the post, liches would be operating at dimension shattering levels of power, while melee would struggle to keep up without similar levels of power on their side: the trope of quadratic wizards, linear fighters at full force. More likely, all beings would be intensely magical in terms of abilities and nature down to their core, and would rely on unique counterspelling powers to maintain combat viability against each other.

** I have to question as to why the author thinks that massed arrow fire would be at all effective in space over incredible distances against skeletons, there are so many problems with that.

Likewise I dunno about LotFP but I don't see why a Lich can't deal with anything with magic rather than resorting to using ostensibly mêlée fighter types, being undead is handy in space but if you lose the ship when you jump from one to another you are infinitely fucked.

  The main weapons for ship-to-ship combat are massed arrow-fire (surprisingly effective, in the void a flight of arrows can travel hundreds of miles)
#+end_quote

I was going to post that exact same thing. "Surprisingly effective?" Sure, if you ignore the fact that arrows are very slow, especially when compared to bullet-speed microspace debris, not to mention that it is applying the same amount of force to the ship... a wooden ship.

**** Hmmm, yeah that bit I don't agree with either. honestly rockets or some kind of none-inertia transferring telekinesis would probably be better for ranged.

If by arrows they just mean ballistic shards accelerated at speed by some manner, preferably combined with the acceleration of your lichjammer directly towards your opponent's lichjammer.

Well at those parameters interplanetary speeds kitty litter can be pretty effective. So saying arrows are surprisingly effective is kind of a misnomer.

[[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunexotic.php][EVERYTHING]] is effective if you line up your relative velocities right.

***** I suspect the author just thought "oh, you don't need to account for the arc of gravity and you can just aim straight and hit anything by lining it up in your sights!"

Now Ive only read about orbital mechanics from a few fiction books by Neal Stephenson, as well as completing some orientation modules on Kerbal, but I think the gravity wells of space make aiming something MUCH HARDER in space at relative distances compared to the gravity well of earth.

******* Which is why all trajectories resemble something plotted by a drunkard - Navigators who survive for any length of time realize that being on a perfectly predictable heading is asking to run into a trap eventually, so thrown variables into their courses. Noone having the energy or resources to trap all possible approaches to any target - space is just too big. In order to avoid having the variations predicted by opponents with epic-level intelligence, standard practice is to use fair dice for this.

** In space, it's hard to replenish your crew and raw materials. Any kind of matter-creation magic would be very useful. Dunno if this role-playing engine has anything that qualifies.

If there is nothing, well. Corpses would be expensive, you'd need to trade with planetbound civilisations for them (or just attack). Magic is plentiful and asteroid mining is easy, so I expect golems would be cheaper than skeletons. Maybe there are angels and weird superbeasts roaming the void that you can hunt for raw materials.

How are ships propelled? Solar sails were mentioned, but other options exist. If you destroy an enemy's engine, they'll drift helplessly in orbit until someone comes to rescue or kill them. That might be the best way to incapacitate an attacker and loot their stuff.

Edit: I forgot to mention, I think this is incredibly cool. There's something about a setting which is explicitly our Earth yet near-exclusively populated by undead, angels, and aliens, which makes it familiar yet very far from a generic fantasy setting.

*** The captains of these ships are liches though. They might be propelling their ships through the void via their own personal magic, whether they consume a fuel to do so or simply cast a spell that rearranges energy to create propulsion. There might be mundane ships captained by lesser undead acting as a lich's vassal fleet, but incapacitating a lichship would ultimately require slaying its master.

*** I don't know the specific rules their using very well. But if create water is on the spell list you can fashion a pretty good engine out of that.

Alternatively most magic users have access to some form of explosive fire ball. So that is also an option.

**** Mass creation isn't for the engine, it's for patching holes in the ship and refilling / repairing your weapons and equipment.

Some sort of alchemical ever-burning fire would be my engine of choice, though I see the appeal of enchanted celestial wings.

***** I was figuring just using a steam rocket. The mass is mostly for propellant. Also ice is about as good as steel in the outer solar system and definitely as good when going interstellar. Essentially create water can with enough time and caster levels make most vessels invincible super massive and also accelerate to arbitrary high speed. Essentially the lowest level clerical lich with a thousand years on its hands can probably punch a hole in the moon.

Dang. You're giving me ideas here. Undead space-wizards traveling through the solar system, but the world is regularly raided by liches who are gathering more corpses, either for themselves or to sell to others. You still have accidents out in the void and need to reinforce your crew, after all, but Earth is the only livable planet at this time.

** Reminds me of a writeup I helped with once for an alternate interpretation of the Elemental Plane of Negative Energy. The entire plane is nothingness except for little bubbles of other planes intruding in: the stars are little bubbles of the other planes shining lights in the infinite darkness. Subjective gravity: "[[http://dungeons.wikia.com/wiki/Book_of_Elements_%283.5e_Sourcebook%29/Environments_of_the_Inner_Planes#Negative_Energy_Plane][The directions to Neverland (Third star on the left, and straight on 'til morning) are completely reasonable directions, and represent another planar bubble that is about 2 million kilometers away.]]". Things that die to negative energy turn into undead: space is full of zombies. By those things combined: "[[http://dungeons.wikia.com/wiki/Book_of_Elements_%283.5e_Sourcebook%29/High_Adventure_on_the_Inner_Planes#High_Adventure_in_._._._The_Negative_Energy_Plane.21][However, these places are also constantly under assault by a low level rain of zombies from space.]] That's not a joke, undead beasts literally float around in the void and choose to fall towards points of light. [...] No matter how deeply you've written yourself into a corner, all your problems can be solved, or at least delayed, by an invasion of space zombies."

** a decanter of endless water ( if those exist in that setting ) would be great for propulsion and weapon a la Kzinti lesson. Specially coupled with mass altering magics like feather fall or their equivalents.(and I realize this would be like a magical mass effect)
