So, I just finished reading the book [[https://www.amazon.com/Too-Like-Lightning-Terra-Ignota/dp/0765378000][Too Like The Lightning]] by Ada Palmer. It's the first part of a new series, and basically it hit like 90% of my "HOLY SHIT THIS IS GREAT" buttons, and I think that it might be of interest here on [[/r/rational]] too, as a genuinely original SF story and setting. I have intentionally not tagged this as RT on the title, because several characters still have opaque motivations that are not entirely clear by book's end and could very well boil down to 'is good/evil', but I suspect later books in the series will explain more, and anyways the majority of the cast has pretty well thought out motivation and beliefs, and finally even the weirdly motivated characters are still really interesting and different (it's hard to explain more without drastically spoiling major setting/plot elements). The book does feel like the ending, while on a decently high note, isn't really resolving the conflicts it set up; it's more of a setup for the sequel, and the end feels quite abrupt. Nonetheless, the book is a worthwhile read and interesting in a lot of ways.

The book is not hard SF - it's very soft SF in terms of physics and science; it cares more about the social systems and politics and societies in a really neat future Earth. Too Like The Lightning does make a really wonderfully interesting world, with a unique future that's complicated at pretty much an ideal level for me to read about and remember every major group, and there's just a ton of worldbuilding. If you're going to compare the setting to something, it might be a less dark and gritty Snow Crash, but certain parts resemble ideas and ideals in things like Scott Alexander's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/][Archipelago]]. There's tons of interesting political ideas, ideas about gender, ideas about religion, and so on... it adds up to a really cool novel of ideas. There's also a lot of focus on philosophy and philosophers, especially the Enlightenment. The author Ada Palmer is a historian as well as a writer, and it really shows with a ton of great work included in the novel (extensive philosophical digressions). The author is also pretty good at not vilifying ideologies or showing too much partisanship, presenting different characters having different opinions and beliefs as equally valid, and you can see how different things would appeal to different characters and why.

Too Like The Lightning has a really unique narrator and a weird, different writing style that is intentionally anachronistic and funky. It's /really/ different from most modern SF. The narrator reminds me of Severian from Book Of The New Sun in a way, having a heavy dose of interesting unreliable narration, but it also does a lot of weird-gender-perception stuff that is not entirely unlike Ancillary Justice by Leckie, so if you hated that novel for that reason then odds are you might want to give this a miss. IMO it does better and more interesting things with the gender stuff than Leckie did in hers, so fans of that sort of thing will probably rejoice. The weird narrative digressions in the middle of the story are also sort of fun. In general, I STRONGLY recommend you [[http://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/][try the free chapters of the novel on Tor]] before buying, because the narrative style is the sort of thing most people will either love or hate.


** I read the first couple of chapters on Tor recently. The writing style didn't put me off, but one thing that sort of bothered me was how much time those chapters devoted to religious themes. At least so far, it seems to be portraying religion in a pretty positive light, which is... not really the kind of story I want to spend time on right now. Did I misread the tone? Does it get less religion-y later?

*** If religious themes bother you then I'd advise you don't continue reading as religion begins to play an even greater part of the plot and characterization later on. It's an extremely important aspect of the novel.

** Interesting - SF tends to go too far in dismissing the social aspects, I think. Added to my reading list.

**** Not blaming you. And Amazon has a great and liberal return policy in my experience.

** Is that the Ada Palmer from Sassafrass? Nice, I like their music and I'm certain her writing is good too.

*** Looks like it is: [[http://adapalmer.com/composer/]] . Her history blog (Ex Urbe) is also really good: [[http://www.exurbe.com/]] . I really liked her series on Machiavelli and how he pioneered utilitarianism and skepticism, and how his life related to the historical situation in Florence at the time: [[http://www.exurbe.com/?p=1429]]

** It took me a while to properly adapt to the writing style, but once I did I found the story to be interesting. Might have to check out the rest of it.

** I second this recommendation in terms of it being an awesome book. Totally blew me away. I don't think it qualifies as Rational (or Rationalist), but it very much falls in the realm of "thinky fiction with thinky protagonists" mentioned on Writing Rationally. I had to put down the book about halfway through and seriously consider what I wanted out of a novel before I continued.

It is slow in many places, esp near the beginning, but the punches that it lands make it absolutely worth it. I will remember this book for a LONG time.
