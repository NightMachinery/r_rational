Hi! I want to write an idiot who nevertheless acts rationally. Because he's not well-read, I'm giving up a bad vocabulary, and an inability to articulate some of his ideas. Is there something else I can do to keep him rational but dumb?

** I'd go with making him unable to think quickly, but able to apply existing knowledge for the most part.

Any quick decisions he makes fail to take into consideration a facet or two that may or may not change the outcome of the situation entirely.

Perhaps he's able to use knowledge he gained, but there's little to no "transfer": when trying to learn a new thing he might miss obvious similarities to things he's already learned, or previous solutions that would work in the new case as well.

Another thing you could do is have him unable to solve most problems on the fly, but able to do so slowly, but usually correctly, given access to a pen and paper.

You know, the more I think about it, the more unattractive the prospect sounds. Good luck making it entertaining. The idea is neat though.

** Clumsiness and naïveté are often the signs of an idiot, but if he's always making levelheaded and rational decisions then he could look like a Forrest Gump type of savant.

**** If he's a /rational/ idiot then he should be finding ways to work around his idiocy. So, what is it exactly that makes him be perceived as an idiot? I can think of a few possibilities (mix and match as desired):

1. Working memory. This is a huge limiter on intelligence, because holding multiple bits of information (e.g. steps in a calculation, facts about a situation, candidate hypotheses) in your head at the same time is crucial for most sorts of reasoning.
2. Long-term memory. Difficulty learning skills and remembering facts makes intelligence harder to achieve.
3. Speed. Perhaps your protagonist simply takes a long time to get to the right answer.
4. Improvisation/creativity. Maybe it's hard for him to figure out solutions to novel problems or react to changes in his environment.
5. Concentration. An inability to focus on the task at hand is a pretty serious drawback, especially when combined with a speed issue.
6. Any of a variety of conditions like dyscalculia, dyslexia, ADHD, dysphasia, dyspraxia, etc. could be interpreted as idiocy by a society that didn't know better. If you pick a specific condition (or combination of conditions) you can also look up how people cope with it.

Almost all of these have work-arounds in a research environment. Have your protagonist treat his mental abilities as a problem to be solved.

1. Long-term memory? Keep extensive notes.
2. Working memory? Use a whiteboard (or similar).
3. Speed? Take extra time.
4. Improvisation? Practice, and come up with new situations to work through.
5. Concentration? Make notes about your thought process and take a break when necessary (i.e. the bookmark approach).

Point being, if somebody thinks that they are an idiot and doesn't want that to get in the way, their first step should be dealing with their perceived idiocy.

*EDIT:* Oh, and I forgot to mention that the absence of these tools can become a source of tension. What if your protagonist really needs to remember something but they don't have their notes?

** Loads of dumb people are quite rational, but their information sets are extremely limited. If he's working from the information set of someone who observes the world shallowly, then his internal logic might be quite consistent but it's application to the world might be extremely flawed.

** You could make him someone utterly outside his environment, like a native from a rainforest who ends up in a modern megapolis. Smart, but outside his context. Or you could make him a pre-teen child. Or an autistic, like in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.

** Keep him from considering second order effects, and from generalizing, but also not make the same mistake twice.

If he knows he is not smart, have him ask for advice from people who have reasons to help. If he knows he is not smart, he should avoid risks; that is seeing consequences of failure, but not being able to plan to avert those, so using the first level effects only to compute risk vs. reward.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626][Here's]] the best recent example of that I've seen. Note that he has low intelligence /and/ low wisdom, so he forgets important things and makes sub-optimal decisions. But I consider him a rationally-written character because he never makes these sub-optimal decisions in service of the plot; only because they're in-character. He also has domain-specific mastery (of a very low-prestige domain).

** Do you want him to be dumb? Because you could also go for not well-read, bad vocabulary, inarticulate, but nonetheless quite smart.

If you want him to actually not be very smart, then I think the key is to make him figure out what he's not good at and how to get around by relying on tools and other people. You could make him act largely as the outside view. He doesn't know how likely your plan is to succeed, but he has figured out that if he takes your estimate and cuts it in half, that generally works pretty well.

** Limited executive function? A character who can carefully solve small problems, but who can't handle being thrown large amounts of information from multiple sources in parallel?

Sure, it can be gotten around partially by using a lot of paper and making tables, or conceptual link-maps, but when you have dozens or even hundreds of data points to analyze and map in relation to each other, it's easy for mental fatigue to set in and the goal to look too far off to be attainable.

** A /simple/ person, looked down upon for lack of sophistication and not particularly deep in thought, who nevertheless acts rationally? I think you can get 90% of the way there by granting him the willpower to follow through on his intentions, and the last 10% by removing certain cognitive biases. (E.g. when all the smart characters are working super hard on something, he might be the one who is able to ignore sunk costs and say "I want to try something else now".)

** I'm currently writing a rational character who is deliberately of "medium" intelligence. They're not stupid by any stretch of the imagination (they're, say, in the 1-2 SD above average range of present 21st century standards), but they're deliberately not the standard genius protagonist you sometimes get in sci-fi. Here are some things I've found help me write them:

- Give them interests and focuses that require some thing other than intelligence as the main determiner of success. In my case this is mostly persistence. Their job largely involves digging through virtual crap and sorting it out. It doesn't require any great creativity, but does require a certain amount of doggedness. Focusing on what they /are/ good at is easier than focusing on what they /aren't/.
- Having a specific idea of some non-intelligence related limitations they have. In my protagonist's case this is social anxiety.
- When things get too complex or outside their frame of reference, have them quite visibly fail to understand and either ask questions or shrug. This has happened to my protagonist so far both with gender and simpler things like x86 emulator formalisms.
- Avoid them having to do things that I personally would be impressed by the intelligence level of. My plot largely consists of the protagonist chatting with people and methodically debugging complex systems.

An unrelated thing I've found useful in the past for playing not entirely rational but fairly stupid characters in RPGs (one was a drunken lord, the other was probably fairly bright but was also 10 years old) is to give them a very short attention span. This neatly does an end-run around letting them do complex plotting and such because even when they try to do it they get distracted halfway through and go do something else.

** check out /Idiot/, I thought it was a bit too real. Then write a character like that, that tries very very hard to not be an idiot, but fails miserably in all critical junctures. Oh god this will be such a horrible book to read.

** You could give him a slow, methodical thinking process. Give him bad instincts. He'll work his way through several bad trains of thought trying to figure out the right one but if he's dogged enough and has enough time he'll ultimately wind up with the right answer more often than not. He'll probably need a foil to help demonstrate that since you don't just want to tell the readers that that's the way he thinks.
