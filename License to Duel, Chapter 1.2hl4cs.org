** I like it! Words of advice, I wouldn't link to the plot reddit comment if you still have it up as I'm not sure. If you follow through pretty far with this it's possible it'll get a big following like how HPMOR has and giving word-of-god info like that definitely reduces suspense/fun stuff.

Looking forward to the next chapter! How often are you planning on updating? Regular schedule?

*** That's a good point. The "real" plot doesn't even start until after all of that is revealed but I guess I could make a puzzle out of each item's powers for the people who didn't read the first post. The only problem is that Yami has no particular reason not to just tell Yugi what they all do. I guess he has no reason TO tell him either. I'll think of something.

I managed to do two in two weeks. I hope to be able to maintain that pace but life gets unpredictably busy. As I get more practice it'll take less time, too.

**** Have yami and yugi not agree. Yugi gets final say in what happens, yami gets trades information to get cooperation. Yami doesn't inherently trust yugi until they both see how each other react under pressure.

** I still kind of hate how awkward it sounds at times but I guess I'll put up with it until my writing skills improve then go back and edit. I am aware of the problem, I just need more practice. The important information is there. The old chapter 2 will be subsumed. If you read the old chapter 2 you know slightly more about the Puzzle than Yugi does, but that's fine. He'll figure it out soon.

I was debating making the identity of the guide hidden for now but there was no real point in it so I just made it explicit. I also debated Yami pretending to just be some guy living in the tomb for mysterious reasons but Yami doesn't lie so that doesn't work.

Yami is intentionally cheesy. Hopefully it's not /too/ cringey.

I'd appreciate any friendly editing advice. I said "Yugi's grandfather" a few too many times but I'm not sure how to avoid that. Yugi wouldn't call him by his name, of course.

Wild speculation is fun too.

Just to confirm, I do know the answers to all the questions people raised in the previous post, but y'know, spoilers.

I've seen about 700 episodes of various Yugiohs and I just learned today that his last name is spelled Muto (or Mutou) not Moto. Whoops.

I'd be astounded if anyone guessed the complete details of how Ishizu's power works already but you can try if you want. Obviously I won't say either way because spoilers.

Let me know if I left out any obvious testable nonsupernatural explanations for things that happened that Yugi didn't think of.
