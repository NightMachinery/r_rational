In general, The Dresden Files is probably a top contender for my favorite book series, but the latest book had a couple things that irritated me.

I [[http://www.reddit.com/r/dresdenfiles/comments/272xga/skin_game_spoiler_is_anyone_else_bothered_by/][made a post about it in the DF subreddit]], and was wondering what you guys thought. Did the ending count as a deus-ex-machina, to you? Are you able to stay immersed in the story when all the God talk is thrown around?


** It does annoy me that the Dresdenverse has an "all religions are truish but Christianity is the only one that's /really/ true" thing going. I love the Fallen, not so keen on archangels walking around betting their mantles of grace on Xanathos gambits.

But what annoyed me the most in Skin Game is how stupid Nicodemus was. First of all, he had loyal minions who could have opened the Gate of Blood for him. Their loyalty was unquestioned, and there was nothing at all to indicate the gate demanded anything more. Secondly, he could have defeated Harry any time he wanted to just by sneakily touching him with a new coin. A Fallen's shadow hostile from the get go could cause horrible damage for Harry. Even if they are stuck in the same situation as Lash was to start with, they would be able to add hellfire to Harry's spells whether he wanted it to or not. Good luck subduing but not killing in the future. And no one seems to know how to get rid of them, so... Yeah, just touch him with a bloody coin.

My strongest objection, as always, was that Harry did not consummate his inevitable relationship with Molly. They /belong together/. Other than that, great book. Not my favourite in the series, but still good.

*** Agreed on all points but one: the coin can be freely given up at any time. We've seen the nickleheads do it a number of times, so at most it would just be a major, but temporary, distraction.

But yeah, there's really nothing that seems to make the Gate of Blood require his daughter's death. I'm hoping that's revealed later, because right now it just makes no sense.

As for Molly, meh. They've got a couple centuries /at least,/ depending on whether the Winter Mantle gives Harry immortality too. Time enough for him and Murphy to work out some long held tension before moving on to the love of his life :)

**** To get rid of the Shadow they need to /Pick Up/ the coin, though, at which point I imagine the Fallen Angel can pull tricks like dumping Sight quality images in their brain, or sending Anduriel a perfect picture of all Harry's knowledge and memories.

***** True. I guess it would still be hard to do in combat though: throwing coins around willy nilly is a good way to risk them getting magically deflected into Hades' treasure trove, while at any point before that touching Harry with the coin would probably have been seen as a breach of his contract with Mab.

****** Oh yes, I'm thinking he would have done it while 'patting him down' or something while he was held down at the Gate of Blood, or at any other point after the Gate of Parkour. Throwing them around during battle would obviously be a high risk move, even with Anduriel in control of the throw.

** Well, to the extent that the story has stuff like the Knights, operating the way they do, having a bit of deus-ex-machina is kind of narratively inevitable.

What might be fun to see is if that gets subverted somehow. (Maybe canceled out by a baddie's faith in some evil principle?) The faith-is-powerful thing cuts both ways. (Hrm... third way: wonder if a well intentioned but confused person's faith in "everything god does is good, all is under the dominion of god, therefore everything that happens is in some sense good" has an "evil = good" effect that would allow the baddies to benefit from whatever faith faithful "good guys" might have.)

Not sure the author would go that route, but might be something to play with, showing that "faith" can cut both ways.

*** Definitely. I was kind of hoping the "white god" would show up at some point, the way Odin and Hades and whatnot have, but at this point I'm pretty sure Yahweh is being held above all the pagan gods, which is rather irritating, because it seems to limit the possible ways it could be subverted.

Jim Butcher may not be actively proselytizing Christianity or monotheism, but it would be nice to at least once in awhile see someone's faith not go rewarded, because rationally it just makes people like Harry look like a stubborn idiot to see it happen again and again and still not be a believer.

Reminds me of a great speculation on [[/r/dresdenfiles]] -- had Nicodemus gotten all five artifacts, he'd have waited for halloween, set them at the points of a pentacle, summoned Jesus, and killed him permanently.

**** Honestly I think christian god whorship included in books helps them sell in some countries like america. I'm okay with this as long as it's not too bible thumpy and in your face. Butcher strikes an okay balance for me, and he makes his sales which means more demand for books and more books for me! Otherwise without his white god is awesome and better than all the others he might get his books on a banned list by some sects/schools as his character 'is a devil worshipping magic user', and whatnot. I'd prefer it denomination free though if the had to have religion in it.

**** IIRC, there were some things that implied that the White God was a "new guy" that more recently moved in or gained that much power. I'm not fully sure, though.

***** ISTR Jim's said somewhere that this is TimyWimyBall. The power the Christian god obtained from so much worship is what allowed him to go back in time and create the universe with people who could believe in him. Except that it's more complicated, and human minds don't cope with it well.

****** That would be kind of interesting, if whatever God has the most faith at the time gets to retroactively rewrite history to have been the one to create it :P Though it seems unnecessary at that point, not to mention logically incomprehensible to feeble mortals like ourselves.

****** I think Neil Gaiman stories work that way as well. It must be alluded to several times, but the one that come to mind is the story where cats dream ; if a thousand of them would dream of the same thing, then they would go back to being basically rulers of the earth since thousands of years...
