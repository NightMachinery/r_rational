Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

**** It depends on how exactly the US is paying up. The whole thing is weird because talks of the bid swap back and forth between dollar and yen. The final bid was US $10 trillion which is said to turn into ¥1 quadrillion, and that's true /at current exchange rate/. But the exchanger rate wouldn't stay static! I'm not sure there even /are/ one quadrillion yens in the entire world. Even if there are, convincing all their owners to part with them would cost far, far more than $10tr. So that doesn't make sense.

More reasonably, if we assume that (without any country printing new money) the US just gathers up $10 trillion from its reserves (/somehow/), spends it all on yens, and hands out however many yens this ends up being, things works out pretty well for all Japanese. Most yens are held by Japanese people. The US is buying them all with dollars at a ludicrously favourable exchange rate. Within three days (yes, to make this even crazier, this all has to happen in three days /somehow/) every Japanese who had at least /some/ yens is now very dollar-rich. Yostuba account holders are yen-rich as well.

If Japan were to then close its borders, you're right that it would just result in inflation. But it's not, it's going to keep importing goods. You're /actually/ more wealthy, you don't just have bigger numbers in your bank account, because you can go trade your brand new dollars for an American car, or a German car from a German who wants dollars. Not at current dollar value, because the dollar just got a lot weaker, there's some inefficiencies due to surprise spending (those cars were headed for New York and redirecting them last-minute costs extra fuel), and there's /some/ inflation. But it's still a windfall.

The Yostuba account holders are even better off, because the yen will remain extremely high for a while longer. Every bank in the world sold its yen reserves to the US and is looking to replenish them. Some of their wealth will also trickle down to the rest of the Japanese economy (they'll buy cars, get tired of them, and sell them for cheap).

Of course that's a fantasy world. In the real world, you can't "/somehow/" move this much money and expect it to remain economics rather than politics. Money is a shared dream; you make too much noise and people wake up. Governments can decide that this transfer is null and void, or that yen is no longer legal tender, or that the US national currency is now the New Dollar.

Some rational non-fiction. This is a very interesting look into the world of fake martial arts - both those who claim to have mystical martial arts powers and more borderline claims like super-exaggerated results from things like Tai Chi and other traditional Chinese martial arts.

The video coves a number of topics, such as 'no hit knockouts' that fail independent replication to the fascinating story of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong][Xu Xiaodong]]. Xu is a Chinese MMA fighter who got sick of the traditional masters making supernatural claims. So he challenged and beat them in a fight. Unfortunately, this has resulted in heavy backlash from the Chinese community and government - who see it as an attack on China.

Also, the video narrator is Irish and has a voice like velvet poetry, so there's that too.

I would agree that it was fairly banal in how far it was willing to go with it's central premise, an Upload has a far more broad utility than simply copying itself and making improvements to the technology it started with.

A fully rational Bob would have been duplicating at every instance where resources to do so were available, the first system he encountered turned into nothing more than a replication facility. Every other problem could then have been solved through sheer numbers alone.

(I do have to say though, that would have made for a slightly less interesting story unless up against a similar entity at an analogous point of development. The Others almost filled this slot, but they were also limited due to culture.)

** Let's talk about XianXia.

A few months ago I found out about [[/r/ProgressionFantasy]] and have read a lot of the recommendations there. This is a genre where there is a system in place that enables the protagonist to get progressively stronger. An example that most here would be familiar with is Mother of Learning (the system here being magic + time loop).

Through there I also found out about XianXia, the chinese take on the concept with chinese medieval kung fu superhero mages.

Unfortunately, most of the books recommended on the subreddit written originally in english are incomplete. There are some that I can recommend though. The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle][Cradle]] has served as a good introduction to the genre for me. Not really that rational, nor that irrational. 7 books are out.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/12311119706248305/Paragon-of-Destruction][Paragon of Destruction]]. I really enjoyed that one, even though it started a bit slow. However, even though the characters aren't irrational per se, a shitload of coincidences, mostly in favor of the MC, seem to happen every arc. This did put me off a little, but I have a feeling it's a staple of the genre.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/reader/][Forge of Destiny]]. A quest. Good writing, avoids the overpowered protagonist trope unlike probably anything else in the genre.

Aaaand that's pretty much it. Other recommendations I've found are mostly 1-2 books long or 100 or so chapters in RoyalRoad.

So I started trying to read some translated chinese XianXia. I was fully prepared for the irational tropes like stupidly arrogant enemies and ridiculous coincidences. What I wasn't prepared for was the quality of the translations...

For example! For some reason, most translations end nearly every sentence with an exclamation mark! This doesn't seem like such a big deal at first! But it completely ruins the flow! Even in exposition dumps. Example sentences: "Warriors who had started cultivating the Knight breathing technique and thus improved their physique, but had not been able to ignite their internal life energy yet, were commonly known as preparatory Knights!

George's physique could be considered at the peak standard even amongst these preparatory Knights!"

I've tried reading Coiling Dragon and I Shall Seal the Heavens with no success. I am currently trying Warlock of the Magus World, which has been recommended in this subreddit before, but it is extremely painful. For me. If anyone knows any english language originals in this genre, or a translation that is not torture, please deliver me from this torment.

I Shall Seal the Heavens is probably the best example of a decent quality 'normal' XianXia with a competent translator you can find, so all I can say is you need to search harder for things written differently that also have interesting plots.

I can't really think of anything that will be good or not without committing time to do grammar checks, but maybe you could try some of the parodies? /Ascending, Do Not Disturb/ is slower paced and might not have all those writing problems, but it's also something of a fluffy romance as opposed to how most of the genre is action.

/Cultivation Chat Group/ might work for you as well, but again it's a parody and you might not get everything without having struggled through at least one or two /real/ XianXia novels. Also, most of it is sealed behind the walls of +Mordor+ Qidian (they run Webnovel), and I cannot in good conscience recommend supporting them in any way or sailing the seven seas to get around them.

*** English language XianXia is inherently shit. If the work is translated, then the author is most typically just an average XianXia fan, who at best makes an effort to just literally translate everything put down, and at worse straight up machine-translated everything. And that's coming from what are often amateur web-novels with already low standards of writing.

And 'western' Xianxia are typically even more amateurish copies of the above, poorly translated chinese ones. Plus, due to the cultural gap between westerners and china, Xianxia typically features offbeat morality. And I don't mean that in the literary, "this character was created to be interesting and flawed" way, but in the "this character was created to be wishfulfilment for people you strongly disagree with" way.

Plus, the inherent setting caveats of Xiania (cultivation makes you stronger, people who are strong tread on those weaker, power diffefentials are super high) tend to increase the level of trashy wish fulfiment to a level I've normally seen restricted to romance fanfiction and harem isekai.

That's not to say there aren't good english language xianxia works. The parody math xianxia, the arrogant young master one, thousand milleniums of cultivation (I've never read this one, but it comes highly recommended on this subreddit) and probably other ones that I've never been made aware of becauae I despise the genre and don't look for works in it. But typically, these "good" works are set apart by:

- being a deliberate parody or subversion of Xianxia tropes. Especially when done affectionately, by authors who are much kinder than me towards the genre, but still aware of its shortcomings.\\
- being written in english or having abnormally high quality translations.\\
- transcending xianxia as a genre, and becoming less "eastern fantasty" and more "eastern inspired fantasy." There's plenty of decent fantasy books out there that steal shamelessly from xianxia and wuxia, in terms of magic, aesthetics and even themes. But because they don't allow themselves to be constraned to being by-the-book xianxia, they get to keep the good stuff, without the bad stuff.

Incidentally, most, if not all, of the above rant applies to Light-novel-alikes (particularly isekais), Wuxia, and loosely to LitRPGs .

*** Xianxia makes me want to write a deconstruction so hard - the entire genre belongs to those fantasy worlds clearly built by a malicious demiurge. - The path to power lies through isolation from human ties and violent acquisition of limited resources. The entire structure of enlightenment is set up to make monsters of those who thread upon it, and then kill them. All of them. Conflict is so insanely ubiquitous, that the fact that the practitioners are technically long lived is meaningless. They spend most of their time meditating (and a xiania protag meditating is safe from their self-destructive path, temporarily. They also are not really living), then exit seclusion and promptly have an orgy of violence, presumably more than anything else to try to make up for a long period of lacking stimulus.

The protagonist is of course a very strong, very lucky Xianxia protagonist, but across the 1700 chapters currently out I'd say the majority of it is at least in part about how classic Xianxia morality just doesn't work as well as a civilised society.

It does take a few hundred chapters for it to be the focus, but I do think if you're planning on putting the time in to read any Xianxia anyway, Fort Milleniums should be the one you pick. It actually is a deconstruction, in the sense of "this is how things would actually look if we took these premises of the genre", modulo the classical OP protagonist*.

  We were shooting in Tunisia, and the script had a scene in which I fight a swordsman, an expert swordsman, it was meant to be the ultimate duel between sword and whip. And I was suffering from dysentery, really, found it inconvenient to be out of my trailer for more than 10 minutes at a time. We'd done a brief rehearsal of the scene the night before we were meant to shoot it, and both Steve and I realized it would take 2 or 3 days to shoot this. And it was the last thing we were meant to shoot in Tunisia before we left to shoot in England. And the scene before this in the film included a whip fight against 5 bad guys that were trying to kidnap Marian, so I thought it was a bit redundant. I was puzzling how to get out of this 3 days of shooting, so when I got to set I proposed to Steven that we just shoot the son a bitch and Steve said "I was thinking that as well." So he drew his sword, the poor guy was a wonderful British stuntman who had practiced his sword skills for months in order to do this job, and was quite surprised by the idea that we would dispatch him in 5 minutes. But he flourished his sword, I pulled out my gun and shot him, and then we went back to England.

Awhile back I also [[http://kineticliterature.com/intelligent-characters-and-the-brains-vs-brawn-fallacy/][wrote about]] characters who are willing to solve problems using physical force, rather than trying to find a complicated "intellectual" solution to a problem:

#+begin_quote
  One of my favorite examples of this comes from a scene in the movie Sneakers (a delightful 1992 thriller and heist movie about cryptography and espionage) where Robert Redford's character goes to steal a cipher device from a researcher's office. After socially engineering himself past the front desk, he finds his caper brought to a halt when the door to the office is protected with an electronic keypad. He radios the guys in the surveillance van and says, “Anybody remember how to defeat an electronic keypad?” Because this is a thriller about computers and cryptography, we expect them to come up with some kind of backdoor solution to breaking this lock, the cyberpunk equivalent of “recite this magical incantation and the lock will open for you.” The audience waits in tense silence as Robert listens to the voice of the computer guys speaking into his earpiece and mutters to himself, “Alright, that might work.” And then he takes a step back and kicks down the door.

** I'm looking for superhero web series. What are the good ones?

One's I've read include:

[[http://inmydaydreams.com/][Legion of Nothing]] A super hero story about the grandchildren of golden age super heroes taking up their forbearers' mantels. It's been running for a while now, has a good cast and some nice development. It features a gadgeteer hero, who builds tech. On the down side, the writing can be a little dry at times (fairly unemotional which is strange since it's first person). It is ongoing.

[[https://the-last-skull.blogspot.com/2010/06/beginning-1.html][The Last Skrull]]. It has a good story, full characters and, get this, a beginning, middle and end (!!!). Despite that, I feel there is just something lacking that stops it being truly great. The story stars a 'Sue Daysdale' who follows in her mothers footsteps as the superhero/vigilante the Skrull.

[[https://web.archive.org/web/20090620070916/http://www.starharbornights.net/content/view/38/20/#story][Star Harbor Nights]]. It is also about superheroes but no long updates. The original site is now gone but can be viewed on the Internet Archive. I remember reading and being rather engaged years ago. It has some interest ideas, like the darkawn (sp?) gene, which turns you into an exception normal if you have one copy, and a crazy super genius if you have two. It has two main plots. One focuses on a new street level vigilante type hero, who is just getting started in a east coast port city (this was written before Worm, so it's not a reference). The other follows a more high powered flight telekinetic, telepathic type as she goes about superhero LA.

[[https://tieshaunn.wordpress.com/table-of-contents-2/the-blazing-stars/table-of-contents/][Brennus]]. One of the first generation of superhero stories spun off from Worm's comments section. Writing is not fantastic (the early novel has some very clumsy exposition) and it is very derivative of Worm but I enjoyed it when I read it. Follows another kid tech hero, though this time with a Mysterious Past (tm).

And finally we have [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] and it's squeal [[https://www.parahumans.net/][Ward]]. Super famous around these parts, may have kick started the modern web serial boom. Well written, misery heavy and engaging.

** I would like to recommend not just a work, or a series of works, but a niche genre: Timelines.

Mostly popular on AlternateHistory forum, with some crossposting to SB/SV, authors write a timeline of a nation or world, typically going year by year as sort of an extended worldbuilding exercise that also happens to have interesting characters or vignettes sprinkled about. They're not for everyone, but if you're a grand strategy fanatic like me, they fit a very particular niche that no other form of literature is able to satisfy.

** This is a request not really specific to [[/r/rational]] stories, but I'm hoping that what I'm looking for may intersect with the interests of some of the dwellers of this sub.

A while ago, I [[https://old.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/c97lvt/looking_for_stories_where_something_seeks_to/][asked]] on [[/r/scifi]] for stories where some humans/aliens/AI/etc use most of their resources to expand their boundaries as fast/far as they can. I got some interesting suggestions, and I truly enjoyed some of these books, but I haven't found what I was looking for. In fact, I'm not sure if what I'm asking for can be made into an interesting story.

The entities I'm thinking of want to take full advantage of Nick Bostrom's [[https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html][cosmic endowment]]. One thousand years after starting expanding, they want the radius of their sphere of influence to be as close as possible to 1000 light years. After a billion years, they hope for that radius to be larger than 1 billion light years (because the universe is expanding). At that moment they would have "won", for no single other race could ever "catch up" behind them (presuming no FTL). And yet they would keep on expanding as fast as they can, because a bigger sphere is better.

Densifying inside that sphere is also important to them, but it has a much lower priority: any equipment left behind in the effort to push forward the shell of their sphere of influence may later be used to densify/colonize its bulk. This contradicts the standard tropes "move to the next system once you ran out of resources" or "run away from the danger (without dispersing)".

So, does this sound like anything you've heard of? I'm fine with "lower quality" stories: I'm fishing for how they've managed/tried to make such a story interesting.

**** Of Egan I only read Schild's Ladder which, although interesting on its own, isn't what I'm looking for here: many of them are contempt with running away from the 0.5 c expanding bubble (temporarily settling on some planet, running away some distance when the bubble gets near, then settling again for some time), while the rest try to destroy/stop the bubble. What they're not doing is trying to expand as fast as they can to secure their future, especially after seeing one example of a bubble of destruction expanding at some fraction of c, whose mechanics they don't understand, so the next such bubble could very well expand at a higher fraction of c. Moreover, the book's theme (and title) revolve much more about what is the self and how one may preserve it in a changing environment, not expansion.

I read synopses of the other recommended Egan books and planned to read them later, but concluded that they also weren't what I was looking for. But thanks to your comment I'll give it another try sooner than later.

I thought about it a bit and the bulk of the book still isn't concerned with what you're looking for, probably.

How concerned with expansion do they have to be to qualify? Like I mentioned the culture books, would you say that the manner in which they expand to be similar to what you're looking for? Almost all of the books aren't looking "inwards" within the culture itself, but instead mostly take place on the frontiers where culture agents are trying to make headway in expanding the reach and influence of the culture, but I'm not sure if you were looking for a model of expansion that looked different to this. For example, perhaps a more barren universe to expand in so expansion is less about diplomacy and conflict with other civs and more about the technical challenges, or something?

Yeah, I presumed some form of "space-faring race barren-ness". The universe is quite old and, if it were to be crowded right now, it would have still been mostly-barren at some point in the past, at which point a race (or individuals from a race) that wanted to expand would have been free to do so.

I see a crowded universe /à la/ Star Trek only possible in some special contexts, such as:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst][gamma-ray bursts]] (or something to the same effect) used to be quite common, and they stopped rather abruptly;

- we are in-between two massive gamma-ray-burst-like events, life flourished after the last one, and is about to be wiped out again;

- very early in the life of the universe, some race expanded very rapidly to maximize the volume of space-time they have control over, but instead of colonizing it they play zookeeper with other races, preventing them from expanding as such;

- due to the anthropic bias, we live in some local neighbourhood of Star-Trek-like crowded space that has been, to this day, spared by "expanding races" much worst than the Borg;

- etc.

Note my explicit use of "space-faring" in the above: intelligent life could very well be common, except that a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][great filter]] occurs at some late technological level.
