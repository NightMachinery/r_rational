Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

*** It's pretty good.

The pacing is still all over the place, but the story gets deeper, and we get a pretty good idea of what the motivations of the different characters and factions are, how they got where they are, and what's at stake if the protagonists fail.

The characters are all compelling and fun, even Viren (whose behavior still makes no sense). The child-queen-who-turns-out-to-be-a-hardass character is a bit of a cliché by now (hell, /She Ra/ did it too this year), but she's still a treat to watch; I like how in her scene, she's both clearly intimidated and unsure, and yet she stands her ground in an extremely stressful situation.

Also that one scene where Claudia goes Palpatine is amazing.

(overall, I'm not impressed with the Dark Magic plot; watching it after reading /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ feels like watching BvS after reading /The Metropolitan Man/; alexanderwales really needs to stop raising our standards so much)

** I've watched The Good Place recently due to it being recommended here.

How do I put this......I'm simultaneously disappointed and in love with this show.

It's a show that explores the idea of a undeserving person who gets into Heaven (aka The Good Place) and I just /love/ how it brings up ethical considerations and moral dilemmas. But every /single/ time that they raise a serious concern about what Ellen should do, the show goes with a joke instead of the ethical argument it could raise.

Basically, it's a sit-com with very interesting themes that are only noticed if you are already in the mindset of thinking about such things. My mother says that she wouldn't normally watch it since it comes off as a typical sitcom which bores her, but she likes watching it with me because we would then have interesting conversations about the ethical arguments that the episodes reference in the background.

So, while I think it's a decent recommendation to this subreddit, just be aware that it's a sitcom and the interesting ethical considerations are very much a background aspect of the show and not the main focus.

PS I've only seen the first season and have no plans to watch anymore of it unless I'm watching it with a friend or family so we can talk about the ethics involved in each episode. By myself, it's too boring to watch.

In this case, it was a little more than that.

1. Scott had/has a habit of going after "the left" for various things that he dislikes and steelmanning the far right because he wants to engage with them in a spirit of mutual understanding and charity. (By most reckonings, he would be fairly far to the left.)
2. Scott's [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/]["Reactionary Philosophy in a Nutshell"]] tract attracted a lot of reactionaries, in part because he was presenting a better, more coherent political philosophy than most reactionaries. The follow-up [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/][Anti-Reactionary FAQ]] came almost half a year later, and didn't really do that much to dissuade the reactionaries.
3. Moderation in both the SSC blog and the SSC subreddit was of a particularly rationalist mode of free speech, where no idea is too obscene or dangerous to be heard, so long as it's reasoned moderately well. This naturally attracts people with fringe views, and naturally drives out a lot of people who are unwilling to tolerate fringe views (whether because they find them that distasteful, because they get tired of feeling compelled to argue against the same fringe viewpoints week after week, or because they don't like being associated with that sort of person).
4. The Culture War threads in particular attracted a lot of reactionaries, especially during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Because it was one of few relatively inviting homes for reactionaries, a lot of them showed up relative to the normal population. Included with those reactionaries were plain white nationalists, or people who had made the jump from being reactionary to white nationalist.
5. This drove a fair number of people away (myself included), which intensified the problem. The "human biodiversity" subject was banned from the subreddit sometime last year, IIRC.
6. Both Scott and the mods of the subreddit have gotten pressure to get rid of the culture wars stuff, in part because it had a bad reputation, and in part because it seemed to be generating a lot of heat and very little light.
7. Scott got harassed and threatened, with every indication that this would continue into the future.

Personally ... as a mod of this subreddit, which is for the sharing and distribution of rational fiction, I somewhat often remove posts that are strictly about rationalism, usually from people who are apologetic and just saw "[[/r/rational]]" and then didn't look any further before posting. People would ask me where to post instead. Similarly, we banned discussion of U.S. politics in these Friday threads (mostly the heat and light issue, partly because it was making this place unpleasant), and people have asked where they can talk about such things instead.

I've directed a handful people to [[/r/slatestarcodex]], and a few would come back with "wow, there's a lot of racism, transphobia, etc. there", a sentiment which I agree with, and which has helped reinforce my negative opinion of the place, specifically the culture war threads. From my perusal of the replacement subreddit, it doesn't appear that their particular slant is much different than that of the culture war threads, at least from look at the highest upvoted comments.

I understand what you are saying, but there is a reason why people should not pay attention to anecdotes. Memories are strongly biased and impressions can be very different from the reality of a situation.

For example, what if there are very few right wing comments, but you think it's more common than it is because they stand out (aka more memorable) than the more common left wing commentary?

If you want to convince people that the CW threads are more right wing than what Scott says, you should investigate where you think his research failed to properly investigate and run your own survey to prove it, instead of simply saying "I don't agree with your survey, because it doesn't fit with my experience."

Personally, I actually think Scott's survey is flawed in one serious way. While it was worthwhile to investigate the political affiliations and opinions of the commenters, I wish that he had created a pie chart of the /issues/ debated in the threads and whether or not more debates were about left wing politics or about right wing politics. Unfortunately, I can't do this myself because I'm not very politically savvy and I wouldn't know any better if I tried to categorize the debates myself. I feel like a majority of the debates are about agreeing with or being against right wing politics, but it's only my impression and it's a fairly subjective division to make as well.

  - You're already familiar with [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][the Antimemetics stories]], I take it?
  - Tentative recommendation: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cool-war-hub][/The Cool War/]], a series about the /Are We Cool Yet?/ Group of Interest. I found it interesting, but it may not be what you're looking for.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld][/Visions of a Better World/]]: why the Foundation doesn't usually exploit SCP objects.

I would appreciate if you later replied with feedback: which of these you liked, and which didn't?

** To anyone who thinks the internet is a special bad place full of censorship where people just can't seem to sit down and have a good-faith debate, don't worry. It's not just the internet. The entire world has always been that way. As evidence, I give you the [[http://cpdp.debatpublic.fr/cpdp-montagnedor/images/CR-bilan/montagnedor-compte-rendu-debat.pdf][Montagne D'Or debate]] (Golden Mountain, a controversial mining project in French Guyana).

Relevant excerpts from the conclusion, translated:

#+begin_quote
  The first impression that dominates is that of a misunderstanding of what a debate is, which implies a progress in the knowledge of a project and in the argumentation. For none of the protagonists could the debate be a journey in which things could evolve. The sole objective of the bulk of the opponents was to make their views heard wherever meetings were held. They did not come to debate but to demonstrate. On the opposite side, the project owner presented a monolithic project, without any proposal of evolution that wasn't marginal, presenting the project in a "take it or leave it" fashion. This is what was expected of them from opponents who did not want to discuss the content of the project, who even blamed the owner for changing some of his presentations from one meeting to another to take into account the comments presented and questions asked, this attitude being denounced as a way to deceive the public through a variable geometry speech. For them, the only change that the owner could make was to withdraw the project.

and

  In this context, the neutrality of the CNDP was challenged by both opponents and supporters, each considering the other party as having been favored. It has unfortunately been observed that the demand for democracy could coexist in the same people with intolerance towards other people supporting a party different from theirs. Booing, anathemas and even attempts at physical aggression may have discouraged speaking engagements in the meeting of people who are in favor of the project, who, very much in the minority, have expressed themselves more on the participatory platform and in the action books.

** On what website to you prefer to read web fiction on?

If I had to pick I would say Archive of Our Own as, despite it's poor tagging system, it has the cleanest looking reading interface.

*** AO3 for me, because it's clean and functional, though I don't really have anything against WordPress sites, depending on the styling. FF.net and FictionPress I both find annoying (more as a writer than a reader though).
