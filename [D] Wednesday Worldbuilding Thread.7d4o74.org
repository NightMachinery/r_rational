Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** So, I was writing up some rules for a tabletop game that takes place within the litRPG story I'm writing, which is surely a good use of my time, and came up with the following mechanic:

- Basic conflict resolution is determined by drawing from a deck of 15 cards, adding one of your four attributes to it, and then comparing it against the numeric difficulty of the task as predetermined by the GM.
- An enate can, at the start of the day, draw cards from the top of their deck and "lock in" a card that they'll use for some specific skill.
- Skills are chosen before the card is set aside (face up).
- That card is then used for that skill for the rest of the day, and shuffled back into the deck only at the start of the next day.
- That skill will use your Wits attribute instead of what it normally would.
- Because that card is now out of your 15-card deck, you've changed the probability for every other draw, meaning that if you pull out a King (numeric value of 13), you will be really good at whatever skill you declared that card for, but less good at everything else.
- You need at least 4 Wits to become an enate, and can set aside cards up to your Wits (which has a maximum starting value of 7). Each card you set aside will be declared for a different skill.

I think that's all well and good for a gameplay mechanic; it's got what I think is a neat dynamic to it where there's some tension about whether you'll make a skill good, weakening your deck, or make it bad, strengthening your deck, and I don't /think/ there's a clearly dominant strategy, aside from maybe waiting day after day until you get the cards you want (which a good GM can handle). There's also some fuzziness on what constitutes a "skill", but this is a rules-light system that doesn't actually have distinct skills, so I think that's also fine.

The question I have is more about how this mechanic gets flavored. Obviously in the real world, there's some baseline of competency, and if the deck is essentially equivalent to rolling a 1d15, success and failure for most things will not land on the knife-edge. It's not entirely clear to me what "chance of success" should be conceptualized, and in practice, most GMs for tabletop games will vary description as appropriate, so sometimes you miss your attack because the other guy was too fast, sometimes your attack bounces off the armor, sometimes you simply fumble, etc.

My first pass is that the enate is restructuring their mind day-by-day, and what pulling out a King and putting it toward swordfighting represents is making yourself a better swordfighter at the expense of all your other skills. Contrarily, pulling out a Two and putting it toward sewing would strengthening the mind at the expense of that one skill, giving yourself a weak spot in exchange for making the rest of the mind stronger. Of course, the card flips aren't just for the mind, they're for the body as well, so you either have to have a conceptual framework that says those are the same thing, or similar enough, or figure out some other sort of handwave.

*** I'm leaving a separate comment because the more I think about it, the more I become convinced that using cards for the randomness in an rpg is /really interesting/.

Consider what happens if you have a character who doesn't shuffle their deck between draws. They instead keep a discard pile, and only reshuffle when they run out of cards. This could be the ability of a mystic who is 'karmically balanced'. And strings of good luck would allow them to anticipate the coming bad luck and burn it off.

Or consider the even more powerful ability of having a hand of cards which you only refresh after using them all. This could be an advancement on the above mystic's ability, allowing them to not just predict, but also control the tides of fate.

If you have a whole bunch of cheap bicyle playing cards lying around (Like I do. I'm into magic tricks), and you 'roll' for damage, then you could give unique weapons their own damage decks, with unique distributions.

Maybe a quest reward could replace cards from the character's personal deck, permanently adding an extra 10, or swapping the king and ace for two 8s.

Maybe a mage could precommit to 'burning' some of their energy when casting a spell in exchange for extra oompf. (If the spell draw succeeds, set aside the drawn card. It is not shuffled back in until a long rest.) Because the card is only set aside on successes, a successful cast will usually render the mage worse for the rest of the day.

**** There have been a few card-based tabletop games over the years, and I think they can do some really neat things that dice-based systems can't (though I haven't found one that's as robust or inventive as I'd like, and the ones that I've actually played have been a little half-baked).

There are so many ways to split a card, either by its identity, its suit, its numeric value, or its color, which means that you can effectively do the equivalent of having someone roll a d13 and a d4 at the same time, at no extra cost. You can key abilities off whether a face card came up too, or have some interaction when the deck gets shuffled, or based on how many cards are in the discard, or removing or putting cards back in the deck. Because the discard is a stack, you can track sequences pretty easily, giving a bonus so long as you keep drawing cards, or if you're on a streak of suits. And that's without even considering the mechanical possibilities that you have if the player has a hand that they can play from.

But I spent a lot of time playing Magic as well as immersed in tabletop games, so "cards instead of dice" is especially resonant for me.

***** One relatively new and still pretty obscure game that uses cards instead of dice is Upwind, where the players each have two decks and hands for normal actions and supernatural powers to use against the GM's deck and hands.

It's designed to emulate high concept adventures in a Treasure Planet-esque setting, so each play of the cards can resolve entire scenes and a single session can cover as much ground as a whole campaign in other games.

When I looked into it months ago I wasn't able to find much information about it other than an interview with the designer and several examples of play from Role Playing Public Radio, though you can skip to their comments at the end of the episodes.

*** #+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What about locking in weak cards for skills that either you don't care about or someone else in your party can do better? It seems like there's no downside to putting a 2 towards, say, thieving, if you've got a specialised thief in the party. Likewise, you can put a 2 towards horseriding if you know you're going to be staying in the dungeon you're in for the next few days.

It's still /possible/ for this to backfire if it turns out your specific character needs to use that skill, but that'll either be by GM fiat and get kinda obvious after a while - in which case this is potentially a way to steer the entire course of the game - or random chance, which is overall weighted in your favour.

**** The intent of this line:

#+begin_quote
  Skills are chosen before the card is set aside (face up).
#+end_quote

-- is that you don't know going in what card you're going to get. I can see where that line might be ambiguous and this is probably a better rendition of that:

#+begin_quote
  Skills are chosen before the card is drawn. The card then gets set aside, face up.
#+end_quote

That leaves you with a fair amount to balance, though I think the GM would have to make sure that skills weren't so specialized that you could guarantee that you had a good melee combat skill; the idea behind the class is that you lock yourself into either specialties or generalities, but in a way that's not as simple or choiceless as having skill points randomly distributed at the start of the day.

*** #+begin_quote
  That skill will use your Wits attribute instead of what it normally would.
#+end_quote

I would remove this clause and then flavor the ability as self induced obsessions.

Typically in rpgs, your skill value in, say, *lifting things* represents your innate abilities in that skill, and the die roll represents the chaos of the real world. Maybe you slip. Maybe you mess up your hold, and can't get the leverage right. In D&D, you can 'take 10' when you aren't under time pressure, and 'take 20' if you can repeatedly try the task without penalty. This represents that "a character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes [and a] character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome."

So if an enate locks in a King in *lifting things*, then for the rest of the day, they are obsessed with looking for things that can be used as levers, hyperaware of which spots on the ground have good grip. If it is possible, even in principle, for them to lift something, they instinctively know how to lift it. The meet a new person and immediately begin looking them over to find the best handholds. This obviously interferes a little with their diplomacy skills.

And if the enate locks in a 1 in *lifting things*, then they have placed a mental block preventing themselves from even /thinking/ about how to lift things. Someone says "Yosef! Lift that rock!", and the enate walks over to the boulder, and tries to lift it with one hand like they would a pencil. They are completely baffled about why this doesn't work. And so for the entire day, they can only lift things that are so trivially liftable that they can lift it without thought. But this frees up their mind to think about other things.

So why do I think this flavor makes more sense if you remove the above clause?

If you lock in a one, and add your wit, then your ability to lift things is constrained entirely by your cleverness. But you have mentally blocked yourself from thinking about lifting things, so how does your cleverness help you?

Whereas if you add the normal ability score, then your ability to lift things now represents the worst case scenario for what you normally could do. A strongman can lift a chair without thinking about it, while Tiny Tim can only lift half an apple without shifting his weight about.
