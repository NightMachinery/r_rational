What the hell? Was Viejo really thinking that giving Simon the vision of her death would not throw whatever carefully set up projections they had into disarray? Why would you risk something that insane?

Also, whatever they know, they seem to be limited in many ways. On the one hand they expected to know everything that teens would do over a whole year when given powers and left otherwise virtually unmonitored, on the other hand they failed to account for the CIA and also seem to only be confined to one continent in their observation/machination, though that may just be compartmentalization on the part of whatever international organization they are working for, if any. And they need to physically break into Randi's place in order to gather info.

In any case, Viejo is either lying to Akvo (and other conspirators?) about her motives or not acting rational. That Simon blunder is just too big for a so sensitive thing like a one year projection of a 100 actors plus a whole world of reactors.
