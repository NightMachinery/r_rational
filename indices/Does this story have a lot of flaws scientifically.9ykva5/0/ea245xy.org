Honestly it's a bit of an odd choice for a book and feels like it falls into an "uncanny valley" of plot, it is neither something realistic enough to take seriously, nor sufficiently obviously false as to become readable as fantasy/SciFi, from the sound of it there is no world building to explain this, the same emotional effect could likely have been made in a more realistic way.

Honestly it sounds like the kind of trashy SI badly written woe is me fanfic that I drop 5 paragraphs in
