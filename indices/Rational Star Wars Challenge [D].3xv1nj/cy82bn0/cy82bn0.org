Jesus this is a shit article.

1.  The enemy having a superweapon with poor design and with no redundancy of critical systems is not a plot hole. This is the result of terrible project management under serious budgetary and personnel constraints.
2.  This is also not a plot hole. Han Solo finds the /Millennium Falcon/ because he was looking for it. He lost the /Falcon/ under unknown circumstances. That he finds it when Rey pilots it is /coincidental/ but that's explained by either the Force or lazy writing. It's not a plot hole though (let alone unforgiveable).
3.  Finn is not just an ex-janitor, he's a fully-trained Stormtrooper. Kylo Ren is /also/ toying with him during their fight.
4.  Someone having greater natural aptitude than someone else is not a plot hole.
5.  Armor containing a location tracker is not a plot hole (nor unexpected).
6.  This is coincidence (bad writing), not a plot hole.
7.  I'll give this one.
8.  This is not a plot hole, just bad writing.
9.  No, the Resistance is not part of the Republic. The Resistance is the Mujahideen. This is All There in the Manual. That it's not in the film is not a plot hole, it's a reaction to complaints that the prequels had too many trade disputes and senatorial meetings. The remnants of the Empire underwent something similar to the Treaty of Versailles. The First Order is then the Nazi party to the old Empire's Weimar Republic. Again, not a plot hole, just information left out (arguably making the film worse, but not a plot hole).
10. They were looking for the map to Luke Skywalker on Maz Kanata's homeworld /you fucking moron/. The whole point was to get information there. They state this several times. Blowing up the planet doesn't accomplish their goal. Further, their Starkiller weapon demonstrably takes time to charge. They also didn't destroy the Republic, just the center of government (the equivalent to destroying Brussels not being the same as destroying the EU).
11. Mentioned but unseen characters are not a plot hole.
12. Characters not being as cool as they should be is not a plot hole.
13. Yes, that was Finn's first real mission. (This article makes a point that he spent a long time working in sanitation.)
14. Someone being afraid of retribution is not a plot hole. Especially not when they have sensitive information.
15. I'll give that Han and Luke weren't acting rationally, but not that this was a plot hole.
16. You having the wrong impression is not a plot hole.
17. Grandstanding is not a plot hole (also, it almost certainly wasn't the entire army).
18. I'll give this one too, but I assume it'll be answered in the next movie.
19. R2D2 didn't know his whereabouts, he only had a piece of the map. So this wouldn't have helped them anyway. That they weren't willing to force open the mind of a droid is to their credit.
20. You can't return Luke to the Resistance against his will. They're trying to bait him out.
21. The Force demonstrably gives vague and inconsistent senses.
22. The argument here is that Han should have given a better deconversion speech? Maybe I can buy that. Still not a plot hole.
23. So they see Han Solo disarm himself to approach and speak with Ren ... and they're supposed to open fire? Against a guy who can stop and/or deflect blaster bolts? That would be fucking stupid.
24. The /Falcon/ doesn't fly perfectly, nor is it clear that Rey is correct that it hasn't flown. A character being incorrect about the state of a vehicle they've never been on is not a plot hole.
25. Stealing things from people who offer you parts is bad for future trade, especially if done in front of a lot of people. There's no justice on Jakku, but a merchant still has a reputation. Offering money first is only sensible.
26. Luke Skywalker's lightsaber doesn't do anything for tracking down Luke. Why is the possibility that Luke left it with Maz completely discarded?
27. None of these are plot holes. BB-8 is only worth so much because he's wanted by the First Order, not because he's a functional droid. And I'm assuming that scavenging is different than just stealing droids. We're also not privy to the conversation that they have.
28. It's never stated in the film, but if you want a guess, he can probably see ships taking off or landing on the horizon.
29. Unexplained backstory is not a plot hole.
30. Already covered.
31. Finn literally saved his life and it's supposedly a plot hole that he'd be happy to see him?
32. This is a question of character motivation (and thus audience interpretation), not a plot hole.
33. I'll give this one.
34. Rey shorts a circuit that releases them. This is an explicit scene in the movie.
35. I'll give this one too, though one of the smugglers gets dragged off as well. It screams lazy writing though.
36. The First Order is racist, humanoids are very common, the vast majority of stormtroopers are never shown removing their helmets so we don't know their race, the First Order doesn't want the expense of variable armor, take your pick. Not a plot hole.
37. This is the same issue as in the original trilogy, with all the same explanations. Hearing about the Force is not the same as believing it and few people /have/ seen it.
38. Open question, not a plot hole.
39. I mean ... they did destroy something like five planets with it. This is a matter of questionable strategic thinking, not a plot hole. And I'm not sure that it was a bad trade, given how little we know about galactic politics and the cost-benefit of superweapons.
40. Recycled plot points are not a plot hole.

What we've got are a lot of complaints about the movie, but not a lot of plot holes. I could give my own list of things that I would have liked a patch for, but this article is /such clickbait shit./
