It was recommended in the hpmor notes a while ago.

A crossover between sailor moon and the dungeon keeper video game franchise.

The dark gods gift some of their followers with magical artifacts of incredible power called dungeon hearts. Particularly fearsome warriors, ruthless cultists, powerful wizards, whatever that particular gods likes. The artifacts rip their soul out and holds it safely in the realm of the darks gods, making them functionally immortal.

Along with that, it grants them a bunch of utility powers. Keeper sight lets them see everything within their territory. They can teleport any object with a bit of concentration. They get some magical construct minions.

Sailer mercury (the smart one) gets accidentally teleported into the high fantasy setting of dungeon keeper, and immediately tricked into trading her soul for a dungeon heart. Beset upon by the forces of good (no good person would ever become a dungeon keeper), and by the various backstabbing dark gods champions, she's definitely an underdog.

What follows is her doing science, figuring out how the different magic systems interact, and generally just exploiting the hell out of the new worlds physics.
