Puns are love, puns are life.

arron is a barely functional pun-master; making a puns of high level math and bible. Ana is a also a pun-master with a more of a focus on the bible. The are pun-married, literally telepathic with each other and live together; but marriage is just a word.

Arron finds a pun that makes artificial intelligence; they make a mistake when making the pun-ai in a way that makes evil government organization find them and they get separated.

Arron and ana go on adventures, arron steals beanie babys form america's royal family, ana goes to lsd-land and nearly transcends to a higher plane of existence, ana cousin joins a terrorist group; all of them are idiots.

These adventures lead to the the archangel keeping the universe almost functional being nuked, the pun-ai being put into a supercomputer with no follow up, a major super powered war lord launching an attack, ana's cousin being part of a terrorist attack, oh and the literal devil leaves hell to try to stop one of their plans to destroy hell.

Ana just was on a ship that is a giant pun with a savior figure in a pun-plan to talk to god about destroying hell thing. Ana asks god about the problem of evil directly god says infinite universes need flaws to be different form each other.
