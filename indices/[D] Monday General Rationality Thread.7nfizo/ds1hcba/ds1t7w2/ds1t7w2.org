A lot more of those have happened since 2008. Kurzweil went wrong on a few major concepts imo:

- Having things local versus having them on the cloud
- Strength of speech/image recognition software (though that's definitely coming along)
- Virtual reality hasn't really happened yet, although it seems like it still might.
- Misjudging cost/benefit for putting computers in everything

I predict that the majority of the remaining things left on the list will be completed by another ten years from now, suggesting that Kurzweil was mainly wrong on timescale rather than on ideas, although a few of them were straight up wrong (local vs. cloud).

Kurzweil's full list, split into categories:

*Achieved by 2008:*

- Portable computers have dramatically become lighter and thinner
- Rotating memories such as Hard Drives, CD roms, and DVDs are on their way out.

*Achieved now:*

- Individuals primarily use portable computers
- These computers [on your body] monitor body functions, provide automated identity to conduct financial transactions and allow entry into secure areas. They also provide directions for navigation, and a variety of other services.

I have yet to see entry into secure areas, but I wouldn't be surprised if it exists. The rest definitely can be found in Apple Watches alone.

- Most portable computers do not have keyboards
- Cables are disappearing

The most recent iPhones and recent Androids can be charged wirelessly, backups are done on the cloud, noone uses ethernet any more (my college only has wifi), etc.

- Books, magazines, and newspapers are now routinely read on displays that are the size of small books

- Computers routinely include moving picture image cameras and are able to reliably identify their owners from their faces

The face detection is only in the last year or so (Face ID on iPhones)

- Schools are increasingly relying on software approaches. Many children learn to read on their own using personal computers before entering grade school.

I'm not sure about children learning to read on their own, but it seems to be somewhat the case. Schools are definitely highly relying on software approaches.

- Telephones are primarily wireless and include high resolution moving images.

- Intelligent routes are in use, primarily for long distance travel. Once your car's computer's guiding system locks on to the control sensors on one of these highways, you can sit back, and relax.

Technically this exists in Teslas and a few other expensive cars, but it still has a way to go before you can actually sit back and relax.

*Not achieved now:*

- Personal computers are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and are commonly embedded in clothing and jewelry, like wrist watches, rings, earrings and other body ornaments

The watches are here, so this wasn't entirely wrong. The real issue is that all of those things would cost too much and give too little benefit

- Computers with a high-resolution visual interface range from rings and pins and credit cards up to the size of a thin book. People typically have at least a dozen computers on and around their bodies, which are networked, using body LANS (local area networks)

Same issue with cost/benefit. Body LANS seems to basically be Bluetooth though.

- Most users have servers on their homes and offices where they keep large stores of digital objects, including, among other things, virtual reality environments, although these are still on an early stage

Stuff is stored on the cloud instead. Also virtual reality is only at early stages now. Also virtual reality environments (so far) don't really exist.

- The majority of texts is created using continuous speech recognition, or CSR (dictation software). CSRs are very accurate, far more than the human transcriptionists, who were used up until a few years ago.

Speech recognition isn't up to scratch.

- Computer displays built into eyeglasses are also used. These specialized glasses allow the users to see the normal environment while creating a virtual image that appears to hover in front of the viewer.

We have the technology, although it's not great, and it mainly hasn't caught on because of privacy concerns.

- Three dimensional chips are commonly used

Not the case afaik, but I'm not sure why.

- Students from all ages have a portable computer, very thin and soft, weighting less than 1 pound. They interact with their computers primarily by voice and by pointing with a device that looks like a pencil. Keybords still exist but most textual language is created by speaking.

Students from all ages do have a very thin and light portable computer (smartphones, chromebooks, laptops), but the rest is inaccurate, probably due in large part to speech recognition. The Wii shows us that the pencil device could possibly work, but it just isn't that efficient.

- Intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning, recent controversial studies have shown that students can learn basic skills such as reading and math just as readily with interactive learning software as with human teachers.

Studies haven't shown this.

- Persons with disabilities are rapidly overcoming their handicaps through intelligent technology

It helps, but I can't say "overcoming their handicaps"

- Students with reading disabilities routinely use print to speech reading systems

I'm not sure why this isn't the case, but it doesn't appear to be the case.

- Print to speech reading machines for the blind are now very small, inexpensive, palm-size devices that can read books.

Reading handwriting is hard for AI still, although I've seen demos. Reading print is definitely available but I haven't really seen it outside of Google Translate. This could probably be achieved in the next couple of years though, especially if it's only print, not handwriting.

- Useful navigation systems have finally been developed to assist blind people in moving and avoiding obstacles. Those systems use GPS technology. The blind person communicates with his navigation system by voice.

GPS technology isn't accurate enough, voice recognition isn't accurate enough, we don't have a good enough map of the world yet - although Google is working on that. Kurzweil should have known in '98 that GPS technology isn't accurate enough for this.

- Deaf persons commonly use portable speech-to-text listening machines which display a real time transcription of what people are saying. The deaf user has the choice of either reading the transcribed speech as displayed text or watching an animated person gesturing in sign language.

Speech recognition isn't advanced enough

- Listening machines can also translate what is being said into another language in real-time, so they are commonly used by hearing people as well.

It exists but it's not commonly used yet.

- There is a growing perception that the primary disabilities of blindness, deafness, and physical impairment do not necessarily. Disabled persons routinely describe their disabilities as mere inconveniences.

Not yet, for the reasons shown above. Mainly low quality speech recognition

- In communications, translate telephone technology is commonly used. This allow you to speak in English, while your Japanese friend hears you in Japanese, and vice-versa.

This theoretically could happen now, but I haven't seen it deployed yet. Main issue is that people hardly ever talk on the telephone nowadays.

- Heptic technologies are emerging. They allow people to touch and feel objects and other persons at a distance. These force-feedback devices are wildly used in games and in training simulation systems. Interactive games routinely include all encompassing all visual and auditory environments.

It's started (see recent iPhones), but only barely.

- The 1999 chat rooms have been replaced with virtual environments.

VR isn't advanced enough.

- At least half of all transactions are conducted online

According to [[https://ycharts.com/indicators/ecommerce_sales_as_percent_retail_sales]], we're at 9% now. It's growing, but it's still a ways to go. Lots of people are working on this though.

- There is a growing neo-luditte movement.

Nope.
