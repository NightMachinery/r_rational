A set of magics based on map/territory confusion:

The better your "map", the more control you have over the "territory" it depicts. Better in this case means more in the way of detail, permanency, and more artistic ability, with a focus on representation, clarity, and precision. Once a "map" has been completed, it can be altered, and alteration of the map will cause alteration of the territory that the map represents.

Cartographers map out the lands, usually in broader strokes, taking pen to paper, typically with extremely precise measurements and surveying equipment. Cartographers are responsible for the macroscopic order of the world, forests and mountains, rivers and bays, making areas hospitable for humanity, usually by providing protection against natural disasters, clearing areas that aren't fit for human habitation, or preparing lands for cultivation. In times of war, cartographers are responsible for erecting "natural" defenses, as well as breaking those same defenses. Defense naturally trumps offense, since

Architects work somewhat differently, working in three dimensions rather than two. They make precise scale models of the building in question, the larger the better, the more connected the materials, the better, and once that's accomplished, they can make relatively small changes to the building by changing the model. Done properly, an architect can change the materials of the building, though subtle shifts are far easier than dramatic ones.

Sculptors typically work with the human form, though a few specialize in animals or plants instead. A sculptor makes a form of a person, as precise as possible, usually at the scale of real life in order to get extra impact. This sculpture is then altered in order to provide benefits to the subject, or in rare cases, to harm them. Only those at the upper echelon of society have a sculptor to their name, given that it's very labor-intensive, but there are many benefits that can be provided by a sculptor, including more muscle mass.

* How the World Looks

The world is divided into the planned and unplanned, with the planned areas being carefully crafted and managed. For the most part, you can tell when you're somewhere that's being actively groomed by cartographers or not, since you'll find much more in the way of both efficiency and aesthetics. All major buildings are crafted by architects, expanded and reinforced in ways that no merely mundane construction techniques would be capable of. With these techniques comes power, and it's a certainty that these professions would be tightly controlled, and mapping restricted to a guild or government branch.

The existence of sculpting means that clothing is conservative as a matter of basic security. Clothing that reveals your shape means that you are vulnerable to sculpting, though a sculpture that's created without willing consent or a sitting would need to be made by a master, and even then would be weak. The protection offered by conservative clothing would only really be necessary for the elites, who are the only ones that would have to worry much about being sculpted against their will, but fashion travels downward to those who seek to emulate their betters.

Sculpture for animals means that the most important animals can be made larger and stronger, though because sculpture doesn't have any impact on genetics (presumably), these alterations are recurring costs as new animals need to be modified each generation. The same is true when it comes to plants, but at least with plants you might have fruiting trees that don't have a definite lifespan to worry about, and don't need to be killed in order to produce a surplus.

The rules, such as they are, defy mass production ... expect that if you go through the work of sculpting/mapping/architecting multiple things so that they can be referred to by the same "map", then you might be able to leverage that. This seems like it would be most doable with architecture, where you're typically creating the base rather than adapting some pre-existing material. I think this probably creates a dynamic where duplicates are a sign of an organizationally powerful civilization, but for the people who are organized that way, a sign of being in the underclass, but I'm not quite sure about that.

I think there's probably more work to do on this, especially with some of the corner cases, logical extensions, implied branches of magic, and consequences, but I'm not currently planning to use it in a story, since the "story seams" don't seem all that deep to me.
