Clarification: I posted chapter 32, which worked... for a while.

Then fanfiction.net stopped showing it (even though it still showed that there were 32 chapters!), and I got all kinds of PMs questioning what happened and why I pulled it. I reposted the chapter, which sent mails advertising itself as chapter 33, and that made /both/ the original 32 and the copy visible. I deleted the copy, and that briefly solved the problem.

Then fanfiction.net started playing up again. By now I think it fixed itself, though. :)
