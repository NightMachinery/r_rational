Chapter 2 of Future Horismos.

Apologies, my main webserver went down, so I have to host somewhere else. My main website should be up again by mid-June, but the posts will keep coming.

Ch 3 isn't done yet, and I'm gone for a week; it'll be done on time, but leaves me less buffer room than I am comfortable with. That's my fault for procrastination.

And I do know that this form of immortality is not quantum immortality. Closer to a save/reload, but without the connotations of save scumming.
