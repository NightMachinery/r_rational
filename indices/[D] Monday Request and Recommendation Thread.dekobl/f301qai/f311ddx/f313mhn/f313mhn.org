I have many beefs with Cultivation novels. I have serious beefs with the 'Grow Strong Enough No One Can Ever Hurt Me" mantra in many of them. Always comes off vaguely fascist to me. And is intrinsically impossible in both the real world and most fictional worlds. I'd love to see a Cultivation novel that deconstructed this and had a hero that learned that groups of people working together are stronger then any individual.

/Street Cultivation/ by Sarah Lin had an unusually sane protagonist...he realized the Tournaments were stupidly dangerous particularly for someone without heath insurance in case he got injured.
