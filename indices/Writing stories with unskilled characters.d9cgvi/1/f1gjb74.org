  what if we have a character that independently comes to smart conclusions. To "reinvent the wheel" as I invoke the cliche.

I think it's all about going back to first principles. And I think this is often a more interesting way to do things. This is how you get around, as you say, having a "rational character having survival knowledge because the author googled the answers." Don't give them the answers; give them the questions, and then let them figure out the answers. (If they're really smart, they should be capable of going through that thought process!)

As an example: thanks to the "weapon triangle" in the Fire Emblem video games a lot of people now know that spears are favored against swords. However, if your knowledge is solely based on having played Fire Emblem, "spears beat swords" is basically axiomatic: "Spears are favored against swords, because when a sword user fights a spear user, the spear user gets a 15% accuracy bonus and the spear user gets a 15% penalty." Okay, that explains how the interaction is formalized in the game's systems, but that doesn't really explain /why/ spears beat swords.

The main reason that spears beat swords is because spears have more reach: if you have a spear, you can engage the sword user at a greater distance than the sword user's reach. And if the sword user manages to close that distance, the spear user can simply "choke up" on their spear (gripping it closer to the tip), to turn their long-range spear into a short-range weapon as the circumstances require. So really, spears beat swords at range, and spears can have approximate parity with swords in close quarters. These are all things that a person could derive on their own if they spent enough time sparring with spears and swords, without ever needing an expert to come along and explain to them that spears are advantaged against swords.

You can also "close the gap" between your characters' understanding and the knowledge they need to have by giving them background knowledge that lets them construct useful analogies that they can use to justify their own reasoning. For example, suppose you have a character who gets isekai'd from a contemporary setting to a medieval fantasy world, and they figure out through through sparring that swords lose to spears. "Man," they say to themselves, "swords are for chumps! Why would anyone ever carry a sword, when a spear is such a better weapon?" And then, after mulling over it a bit, they might recall that, back on earth, people routinely carry handguns around for defense, even though rifles are capable of firing shots much more quickly and accurately: yes, if you know that you're marching off to battle, you'd rather have an AR-15 than a glock, but when you're going to the laundromat or convenience store, it's easier to carry a glock than an AR-15: its more compact form factor makes it easier to carry, and you can casually walk around carrying one without drawing a large amount of attention to yourself. One is a weapon for soldiers who are marching off to battle, and one is a weapon for adventurers who might occasionally have to defend themselves from assailants as they run around performing their errands/fetch quests. They can figure all of this out based on their own background knowledge without needing a wise mentor or genre-savvy companion who gives them a lecture to say, "The reason that adventurers favor swords over spears is..."

In "rational" fiction, there's a temptation to say, "this person got isekai'd to a medieval world, and they know everything that they have to know because they were a medieval scholar with a Ph.D in European history," but oftentimes, it would be more interesting to have a character who takes the lessons that they learned in a contemporary urban setting and apply them to a medieval setting, because that gives them a learning arc that we're able to follow. They don't have to start from /zero/ knowledge, but having a character who /figures out/ what they need to know can be a lot more fun than a character who simply starts with all of the knowledge that they need. Shouldn't "rational" fiction focus on characters who are actually rational, as opposed to being merely knowledgeable about a specific subject? Smart people are smart because they're good at /finding/ answers to tough questions, not being conveniently imbued with all of the answers to every problem they encounter.

There's also a certain level of plausibility that you gain when you aren't giving your characters rare knowledge. Having a character who knows all of the streets they need to navigate in a zombie apocalypse because they delivered pizzas or drove for Uber is a lot more plausible than having a character who knows every street and every tunnel in the city because they were an urban planner who worked for the city (and realistically, the delivery driver will probably also have a lot more experience with /navigating/ that environment than someone who is used to viewing the city layout through diagrams). A person who knows how to handle themselves in a rough neighborhood learning about medieval combat feels a lot more plausible than a medieval history expert learning to be an expert fighter because they're really good at applying their book learning in combat.

You can apply this to social problems as well. A character who finds themselves whisked off to space and forced to interact with cultures on other planets isn't going to know everything that they need to know about alien cultures. They aren't going to be able to know just from looking at a different species, "Oh, that guy's a Klingon, which means that he values honor, and detests cowardice." But they can go back to first principles: our human protagonist knows that everyone responds to incentives, and what incentives they respond to most strongly will be based partly on the value systems that exist within their culture, and so our protagonist can start negotiating with another species by first adopting an inquisitive posture in order to figure out what that alien's value system is. Some aliens care purely about material profit, while others care about things like "honor." With certain alien species, it's best to be friendly and magnanimous during negotiation to engender trust, and with others, it's most strategic to be cagey and keep your cards close to their chest. Our protagonist will do all of these things not because they read a textbook about alien cultures or "learned about Klingons from Startfleet Academy," but because within several minutes of meeting a Klingon (or observing as they negotiate with a third party), you can make a pretty good guess as to what kind of behavior is likely to offend and what kind of behavior is likely to appeal to them. Occasionally, our human protagonist will make the wrong call and do the wrong thing due to an incorrect reading of the situation, and we'll be okay with that because cultural misunderstandings happen, and when they produce conflict, that makes the narrative more interesting.
