I tried posting this before, but I think it got swallowed by the filter. I'll try again, a little differently this time.

*TL;DR:* /In Fire Forged now has a regularly updating blog and prose is being actively written again at faster-than-snail pace without being deleted immediately thereafter as unworkable./

Hello there, everyone. It's been a long time. Some of you may have read or heard of the story I once started posting about on this subreddit, others may not have.

It's called In Fire Forged, and it's a massively AU rational Naruto-fic which will later have some rationalist features as the characters mature and grow. Since I posted here last, a truly massive amount of world-building and plotting has gone into the story. I now feel much more confident about continuing to write, since the impending (and preceding) plot is no longer hanging by the thinnest of threads backed only by my intuition that "things were going to work out fine if I just plowed ahead."

There are more details on why I stopped writing for a while at the blog, which will be the go to place for any further updates on the story's progress. The blog's setup is not yet complete, but I can't offhand think of anything that it absolutely needs that wouldn't take a huge amount of time to create (such as a glossary of terms and/or characters, which I am considering). Suggestions are welcome.

I beg the mods' forgiveness for this first announcement not being strictly a piece of rational fiction. I will forgo mentioning my twice-monthly progress updates here in the future, but will post links to the lore and world-building posts as that seems safely on topic.

I've already got one such post cooking, on the topic of how chakra works in general, and I think it will go up sometime this week or the next.

Lastly, I hope you folks can forgive me for the delay as I slammed on the brakes and paused to pick up the pieces, but I think we're going to see a somewhat smoother ride from here on out.
