This is a story idea I'm kicking around. I follow rational and read a lot here, but I can't promise this is rational. It's made to just have this character that can do whatever and who would be the all powerful side character in other stories. It's who we would all want to be, but I know in stories that takes the tension out. I think it could work as comedy/slice-of-life (depends on if I am actually funny). If it doesn't sound good or rational, let me know with a comment. (I am aware it will need grammar and spelling passes, but if you like pointing out typos it won't hurt my feelings)

post title: LFG (Looking For Goals)

[transmission start] Sigh. What is a man to do when he's done everything? This is the question I face every day. (Make sure you go back and reread that in a despondent voice, not a proud voice. If you are lucky enough to be in a reality where this humble posting gets narrated, I trust the narrator to capture the spirit of this, perhaps rereading it here. And yes, noble bards, audio jockeys, and voice actors, you should read this too. You are doing a fine job. Just wanted to let you know that. I have consumed a lot of audio works of all varieties while focused on my magic endeavors, keep it up.) I seem to have got sidetracked, so continuing on what do I do?

Attached Here you will find my Resume (read: Life Goals) so you can get a sense of who I am now.

Wizard

Titles: too many to name.

Life Goals Resume/CV

Be able to cast all levels of magic on Fruvia [DONE]

Craft artifacts for all stat levels [DONE]

Create Own Spell [DONE]

Master custom time compression spell [DONE]

Fall in love [DONE]

Resurrect Wife [DONE]

Destroy Bachius for killing my wife [DONE]

Have a life together with wife [DONE]

Reverse Old Age and Stop Death - Absolute Resurrection [DONE] Note: Interdicted by gods. Talked to wife and she is happy and safe in the heaven realm of her god. No plans to kill gods yet.

Gods beg for help saving a plane of existence, so help for removal of interdiction on Absolute Ressurection [DONE] Note: Given new continent in planet Kazvum on that was the result of saving this planet's threatened plane of existence. Interdiction on Absolute Resurrection partially removed.

Complete spellbook [DONE] Note: All known spells from this plane and original plane recorded.

Catalog known planes of existence [DONE]

Complete spellbook (2) [DONE] Note: All known spells from the planes it is possible to travel to recorded.

Create New Spells [DONE] Note: Now I can literally create spells on the fly for anything, so I just have anything new I create auto record into the master spell library.

Attain godhood [DONE] Note: Undid this. This sucked. I am effectively more powerful here than as a god due to the (undecipherable) politics. They are scared I will come back now.

Design better heavens [DONE] Note: Running an engaging afterlife is a lot of work. This is why most are blissed out zones, voids, or torture by demons. No maintenance.

Automate better heaven [DONE]

Kill Zoltameka for shredding wife's soul [DONE] Note: Killing her took me a literal hour subjective time. Ended up wiping out her entire pantheon. All souls they had were transferred to one of the heavens I set up before. Killing the gods is too easy now, no challenge.

Get wife's soul back [DONE] Note: Can't recreate souls once fully dispersed. Process if needed again: had to travel to the second she was destroyed while perfectly concealed from reality, contain all soul fragments, then come back to the present, and then piece them together to avoid a paradox this time. Wife is now in heaven 2438926.

Rescue all shredded souls [DONE]

Catalog all types of living creatures [DONE] Note: Started a business for fun using some of this info. The ability to just portal one over from them saves me a few seconds compared to creating one from the catalog scan.

Design construct versions of everything [DONE]

Go back in time and create giant lizards and giant bird lizards. [DONE] Note: This was done when I was too bored (and maybe high on an experimental potion). Looks like I added them to literally everywhere on page 5328 of the planes catalog. Choosing not to undo them. Its fun to see what they are named by people.

Fix all the stupid names people gave my creations [DONE] Note: They are called dinosaurs now in common. May have gotten too overprotective on the names, but the ones I didn't like are changed now. Floofadoodlemus is a terrible name. Almost wiped that person out of existence, need to be careful and not smite sentients. Spinosaurus is a much better name.

Master cooking literally anything that is not made from sapients [DONE] Note: Best dish is Brontosaurus Shoulder glazed with Venluvial Honey and lightly roasted Lignatol tubers.

Duplicate anything mundane with or without magic [DONE]

Master science in this plane and all others [DONE]

Stop all possible "universe optimizers." [DONE] Note: Setup macro against this everywhere I can currently find. I'll have to address new universes as they pop up if they don't automatically get tagged.

This is not the story of how I did all those things. This is not how I became who I am. Honestly, my story started so long ago that I'd probably get details wrong. Everything since the Perfect Memory spell is clear, but before that, the memory/data just didn't exist the same way. There is also a chance I just will lie to you for your own good. I have my share of “forbidden knowledge” (read: antimemes, infohazards, eldritch phone number equivalents (that reminds me, Grtchlkpg, mental dial me again if you see this. I have a better plan this time. I blame Kevin for last time.), and all the multiverses' languages' grammar rules) you don't want to know.

Kevin got me on this, so blame him for the rambling. Retroactive Edit: Kevin has/did/will inform me that this is not what he meant. Oh well, the Multiversal Post spell has to be good for something besides the royalties from creating it, so I'm using it for this Kevin. I have been informed people dislike someone who is “overpowered” and I think that's ridiculous. Someone “overpowered” us who you want as a friend when some intergalactic power wants to demolish your planet to make way for a hyperspace lane.

Anyway, I could spend all day with asides. (Ss was reported in most realities that received this post, so here is a retroactive edit to preempt that in the now prime timeline. Instead, I will leave all of my asides in footnotes starting from this point on. You may notice some above depending on your realities function of linearity. Except the very first ones and this one. I am forcing you to read this. Actually you could stop reading, but then you won't find out what this is about.)

My original plane/universe functioned on what many realities call Adventure Spelunking 16th edition, Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, or the fantasy realms in Zwaehander Piercing Realms - Jacked In For Life. This post is directed to some point in your time stream and planet where at least one of those exists or existed and is researchable. I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader, listener, or krlchm (if that doesn't translate, just crunch rocks together for the right sound). Retroactive Edit: I will get better with footnotes in future posts, this one is too much trouble as the starting point. Beware this may not be linear chronologically after this post, but a parity spell forces this one to be first if listed) Anyway, I would be way, way, way past level 20. (Heard of aleph numbers? Versaucius can teach you if you find his tube of knowledge.)

You saw my accomplished life goals. You saw the ?. I am looking for interesting individuals to become acquainted with.

I am bored.

Consider this a challenge, friend request, gauntlet thrown, rose stomped, whatever your specific reality or culture calls whatever this is.

I need something to do. If you live/work in a universe with hard alignments I don't specifically exclude you, but if your alignment is more towards evil we may have some philosophical differences. Fear not though, I have had a few friends who have shifted alignments (or not changed) because I cleaned up some of their actions' repercussions. Yes Kevin I'm talking about you. In my universe, or at least my original universe, I am considered true neutral. I used to have a good alignment but the ennui of the countless ages kind of numbed me to the fact of everything. Besides I don't think karma or whatever all these multiverses use was made to handle the actions at my scale. Supposedly destroying a universe is infinitely negative karma, but it's not infinitely positive if you re-create it perfectly. And there was never a karma value assigned to completely redoing all of the afterlifes to be positive and to prevent people from turning into just happiness pumps or being insane or being tortured. But I digress.

Give me an adventure idea. I will post this to specific places across multiple universes/realities through my spell. If no one reaches out, I'll probably just go visit Kevin again. I still need to get him back for what he did to my dinosaurs...
