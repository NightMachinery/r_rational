I don't know about brightest, but the one that personally comes to mind is one I thought of when the seasons were mentioned in the first book was that the setting had a lot of little things that are easily squared away by a "it's a constructed scenario". It might read like an attack on the worldbuilding but many of the established facts about the world seem very videogame-y/simulation-y speaking from a distanced view of them. This gets reinforced with things such as "magic coming back with the dragons" and "3ER as the primary observer".

Otherwise I think the ones in the OP are worthwhile avenues, though I don't think the fanfiction scene will be as big, at least not how I see it at present. The HP fanfiction scene was already well established before book 5 came out.
