*A/N*: Dun dun dunnnn! Probably quite a few of you were expecting it, but here we are. Everyone's favourite renegade lion king is back!

You might have noticed that the Lion King has some contemporary themes. I mean, hyenas which are not allowed to enter the Pridelands because they are foreigners who cannot be trusted? And then in the Lion Guard cartoon you have Kion who for the first time invites other species into his guard, one of them a girl, much to the chagrin of his traditionalist father.

On the other hand, Kion doesn't actually disagree when Zira tells him that lions are superior in her Lions Uber Alles speech (No really, the song is literally called "lions over all"). He just says that 'using fear and threat is no way to rule', and he never questions the fact that he is part of a monarchy. In Simba's Pride, Simba even literally says that not wanting to be a princess is 'like not wanting to be a lion; it's in your blood'. So that's a pretty interesting duality which I wanted to explore.

As for which viewpoint I agree with... well, what do you think? Who is less wrong here, Kion or Jasiri? Write a review and let me know!
