Well that was abrupt, but not unexpected! Now that it's over, some thoughts on book 1. It was... alright. It had a modicum of creativity, and wasn't afraid to get a bit /weird/ with it. On the other hand, in 73 chapters we have almost no real information about the dungeon or what it is or why it exists, except as a wish fulfillment vehicle for the main characters, and after all that time it was beginning to grate a little. It's rude to your audience to dump mystery after mystery if you don't really intend on offering a solution, or enough clues to reach a solution.

I thought the first 2/3rds were pretty interesting- I think my favorite parts were the real world situations, where the dungeon was an ominous and unknown threat with mysterious rules and powers kind of lurking in the background. Those sections felt the most grounded and relatable. The actual dungeon-running portions felt a lot more like a Monty Haul D&D scenario- just an endless string of fights with no narrative tension that even the characters don't take seriously, and huge piles of loot and powerups that weren't really earned. The threat of the dungeon outside did not scale at /all/ once the characters were trapped inside- to be honest, it felt like during the final dungeon safari chapters the author was getting a little bored and tired of the whole premise, and the whole thing kind of toned down to make it easier on the characters so it could be wrapped up faster. It was actually kind of interesting, as the writing seemed to get into a depressive funk around the time that the main character was overcoming his own. I've been there, Mr. Author. I recommend a break until the characters and the world start to feel fun to write instead of a chore again, and maybe a 3g dose of psilocybin if antidepressants aren't working for you.

Overall I think it showed a lot of promise. Recommendations for the future- you really need an emotional arc for your characters, something that drives them or that they can overcome, and you need to make your fights a reflection of their narrative struggles instead of just RPG encounters. I love the weird-ass magic system you have going on, and I'm really hoping you can tie it all together with some kind of /purpose/ if you come back to this world. I'd like to see more written about the real-world repercussions of all of this. Also, if you are going to use the dungeon powers as some kind of social re-engineering project, start figuring out how you're going to do that instead of having the characters just kind of allude to it- it didn't make a lot of sense, none of them have seen anything that would suggest they're going to get save-the-world level power in here.

Finally, thank you (assuming you read this) for all the hard work! I know I'm being critical, but really I did like it enough to make it all the way through so you're on the right track. Keep trying, you're going to do amazing work.
