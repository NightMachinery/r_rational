Part of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops][infinite loops]], a story about a world-computer simulating fiction. The mlp loops are probably the biggest these days.

It's a bunch of short fan-fics, linked together, with the central premise of immortal beings having fun.

  "Taylor."

  "Yes Lisa?"

  Lisa buzzed her wings. "I don't know how, but this is all your fault."

  Taylor checked her own carapace. "That is hardly fair."

  Lisa shouted back "We are big horse shaped bugs! You have to be the reason somehow!"

Especially entertaining if you have read Eliezers [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover]], and presume that the stories are some kind of esoteric ritual to fuck with a fiction optimizer. Or that the whole world tree is running off permutation city logic in general.

  I walked into Winslow High with a bright smile on my face, contrary to what anyone would expect of me at this point in time. I could feel the insects all around me, in the walls... including the extras I'd spent a few weeks inducing to nest. My three 'tormentors' spotted me and moved towards me; they couldn't abide me being happy, after all.

  "What are you so happy about, Hebert?" Madison asked, as they surrounded me. Predictably, none of the students or teachers seemed to care.

  "Did you finally get a new mommy?" Emma sneered. That was really not one of her best lines. Though granted, it might have worked if this had been my first life.

  "No," I told her, not letting my smile slip an inch. "I got something better."

  This made Emma frown, and Sophia quickly stepped up to take her turn. "Oh, please, Hebert. Everyone knows that you're a wimp because you miss your mommy. What could you possibly have found that's better?"

  "Funny you should ask!" I said. I called on the swarm. It boiled out of the walls, causing the students to begin running and screaming. Sophia looked angry; Emma and Madison looked like they wanted to run. "The answer is BEES."

  I raised my hands, and my bees descended. I began cackling, acting as if I'd gone and snapped completely. "BEES! BEES, BEES, BEES! YOU GET SOME BEES, YOU GET SOME BEES, EVERYBODY GETS BEES!"

  Internally I was, well, cackling just about as much as I was on the outside. I could never quite predict what the outcome of me letting loose on the school would be, but it was usually interesting, and the looks on their faces were so worth it, even if doing this meant my choices would be limited for the rest of the loop.

  I wonder if they'd send me to the Birdcage again? It didn't happen often but it wasn't completely unknown. Next time, I was planning on usurping Teacher and seeing where that went. Maybe I'd get to find out soon!

  "BEEEEEEES!"
