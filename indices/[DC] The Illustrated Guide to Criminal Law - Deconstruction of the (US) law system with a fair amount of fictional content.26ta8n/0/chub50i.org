This is a quite wonderful series that I'm not at all up to date with. I've always liked law because it's an attempt to formulate a concrete set of rules that apply to the immense variety of things that happen in the course of human life.

Along the same vein (and perhaps worthy of its own submission) is [[http://lawandthemultiverse.com/][Law and the Multiverse]] which goes over how the law would work if there were things like superheroes. They also have a book out.

I once tried to write a courtroom drama that picked up where the /Man of Steel/ movie left off, but realized that I was way, way too far outside of my area of expertise, both in subject matter and genre. The only scene that was any good was a bunch of low level paralegals arguing over who was going to serve Superman his summons.
