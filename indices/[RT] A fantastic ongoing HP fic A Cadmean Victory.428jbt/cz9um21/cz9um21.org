Spoilers - General plot

Well, I'm reading this. It's certainly not rational - more of a dark story with some romance elements - but it's interesting enough to keep me reading. There is some serious suspension of disbelief needed in the relative speed at which harry learns things, but it's certainly not the worst fic I've ever read for unwarranted powerups.

The one thing I will say is that the casual and vaguely justified evil is starting to grate. It's like the author has an improperly calibrated moral compass - Harry is lambasting Dumbledore for (in his mind) being willing to sacrifice him for the Greater Good, and yet has justified some seriously warped actions of his own with almost the same justifications. While [[#s][]] is likely... understandable if not justifiable - already escaped once, plot related reason for a needed death, the casual way in which [[#s][]] for what seems to be no other reason than a /low score/ and being a general prick is alarming at best. Same with the [[#s][]]

There is a serious Protagonist Centered Morality problem here. In the latest chapter I've read he effectively [[#s][]] He doesn't even think twice about it.

If it wasn't for the romantic sections, I'd think he was a sociopath. The connections between Harry and Tom Riddle are often brought up but discounted, and Voldemort actually seems more sympathetic in this than normal, making the difference even less obvious.

Edit: Holy Shit! Just finished another chapter. What happens to Umbridge is Nightmare Fuel. Voldemort would be proud.

Edit 2: It gets worse. Is there a word for 'I am between apathetic and actively malicious to the lives of anyone outside my direct family ingroup' ? because this is it.

If Voldemort (who at least seems more rational here) doesn't randomly torture his followers, I'm not seeing much of a difference between the two.
