*Warning, spoilers:*

Now about 10 days ago, I posted my new web serial here for self promo, saying I felt that it fell into the category of aspiring rationalism. The main reason why I thought that was specifically of the lead up and conclusion of the end scene in this chapter.

Here's an excerpt from my author's note, before I feel like I want to elaborate more on it.

  Anyway, I'mma ramble a bit so skip this if you guys aren't curious about my intentions behind the development of Salvos leading to this chapter: if you guys are curious about the very basic idea of how I conceptualized Salvos as a character in this first arc so far, it came from when I was reading Hegel's /Phenomonology of Spirit/ for one of my political theory classes this Quarter. Specifically, his idea behind self-consciousness in the section on Lordship and Bondage:

  /"Self-consciousness exists in itself and for itself, in that, and by the fact that it exists for another self-consciousness; that is to say, it is only by being acknowledged or “recognized”. The conception of this its unity in its duplication, of infinitude realizing itself in self-consciousness, has many sides to it and encloses within it elements of varied significance. Thus its moments must on the one hand be strictly kept apart in detailed distinctiveness, and, on the other, in this distinction must, at the same time, also be taken as not distinguished, or must always be accepted and understood in their opposite sense. This double meaning of what is distinguished lies in the nature of self-consciousness: --- of its being infinite, or directly the opposite of the determinateness in which it is fixed. The detailed exposition of the notion of this spiritual unity in its duplication will bring before us the process of Recognition."/

  *Tldr of the whole section:* Hegel thinks conflict comes from all conscious beings wanting to be recognized--- to be treated as a subject and not an object by another. There's also the thing about the Lord being dependent on the Bondsmen who gives him their recognition so he is actually not free, etc

  How this applies to Salvos is pretty straightforward. She's in a world where everyone treats her as a rock when she doesn't want to be a rock. A rock, like an object to be used, not a person. The wild Demons see her only as a thing to kill and evolve with, and the other intelligent Demons she met are the same. The [Djinn] doesn't call her by her name even after she introduces herself, wanting only to force her to go with him for his own advantage. The only person that offers her the recognition she--- as a fully conscious being--- wants, is Haec. And that was what drove her to go back for him here: to preserve the one thing that makes her distinct in a world where everything is /(appears to be)/ the same.

Now, as I'm sure anyone who has studied Philosophy knows, Hegel's way of thinking is rather outdated. But when I was coming up with the idea of a non-human but fully conscious being as a character, I thought to myself: what should they be like?

It was something which I was torn over: Should they be completely animalistic, only attaining cognizant thought after they evolve? Should they be a completely blank slate, like a robot that slowly learns to feel emotions?

I wasn't entirely sure. However, Hegel gave me the perfect skeleton, I felt, I needed to create the character of Salvos. Here, I could apply this /almost/ alien way of thinking (compared to the modern understanding of human beings) and still have her act within the bounds of rationality and growing rationality.

Whether or not I executed it well... I do not know. Which is why I decided to post the chapter here once again, to hear any thoughts or feedback on how I did it from you guys.
