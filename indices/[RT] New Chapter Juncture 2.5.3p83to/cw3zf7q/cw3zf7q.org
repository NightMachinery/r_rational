The protagonist seems surprisingly unimpressed with Siegfried's power, given that it basically gives him extremely strong manipulative powers.

The biggest problem is that he can't directly correlate emotion with persuasion in the general case (e.g. there's no obvious emotion for "agree to give me a loan" without other personality insight), but he'd be able to defuse arguments extremely easily.

It also doubles as a predictor, would be useful for assessing threats (e.g. if somebody has a fear response to "we know you've been working with The Grey Falcon", they might be a double agent).

In any interpersonal situation it's some pretty broken shit, which makes the lack of reaction surprising.

Then again, it's possible Siegfried used his power to communicate that information in the least alarming way.
