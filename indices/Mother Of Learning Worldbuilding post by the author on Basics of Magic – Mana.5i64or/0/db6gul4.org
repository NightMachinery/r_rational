I want to make experiments on mana now :

*Serie I of Experiences: Do mana have mass?*

/Experience 1a:/

Does mana have weight?Two box identical, one with mana, the other without. Is there a difference of weight?

/Experience 1b:/

If mana has mass, what the law of mass concentration like? If a mage sense “two time the mana” in the box, is it equivalent to 2 time the mass? Are “a lot of mana” equivalent to “a lot of mass of mana”? Draw the curve: “mass concentration” vs “mana quantity” (we need a way to measure what mana “power” is : a magical tool which stop working at a precise amount for instance) Result: with the curve “weight” vs “mana power/quantity/whatever/” we can measure simply the mana of a region with a simple balance between a box without mana and one with local mana. The curve give then a coefficient between the two values.

/Experience 1C:/

If no weight can be detected, try to detect inertia: send a high velocity bullet against the two box. Do they have the same momentum after? if no, mana have intertia. Repeat 1b to have the curve “inertia” against mana quantity. If no weight but inertia is detected, mana is not affected by gravitational force but have a mass (which sound really weird) If the weight and inertia is detected, this is an important step to demonstrate that mana is made of normal matter. Is weight and inertia are not detected, mana has no mass.

*Serie II of Experiences: What are the constituent of mana?*

/Experience 2a:/

Try to find a way to “destroy” a magical object with too much mana. can we “enchant” a gas inside a lightbulb? When we put too much mana inside the lightbulb, what is the spectrum? the same that the gas of the lightbulb or other element are appearing? If the elements in the spectrum correspond to element not in the gas, we have discovered some constituent of mana. If not but we observe some spectral characteristic, with a few quantum mechanics formula and theory, we can learn a lot about what is mana. If there is no special signal with mana, I don't know... try to find a signal in ultraviolet? in infrared?

/Experience 2b:/

Are there a way to destroy mana? is yes, can we destroy mana in a box where there is a vacuum? What happen then? are there any deposition on the box? like carbon trace. Is there any gas inside the box? Are the deposition/gas a known material or a new material? what are their properties? If mana has mass, do the mass change? Can we have a conservation law of mass with mana?

*Serie III of Experiences: What are the thermodynamics properties of mana?*

/Experience 3a:/

Does mana have temperature?

/Experience 3b:/

Does mana have a pressure? Probably not if it can pass inside solid. But artificial zones without mana exist so the frontier can create a separation. A pressure can be exerted against this “frontier” ? This pressure change in function of the local density of mana ?

/Experience 3C :/

Can we heat mana if we compress it? Is mana really like a gas? Are mana respect the law of thermodynamics? /Experience 3D :/

If mana can be made colder (with decompression for instance), does mana have different phase? liquid mana ? solid mana ? plasma mana ? other form ? can the mana be used in this form ? do they traverse solid/liquid/gas in the same way ? If heated too much, do me have a decomposition in different elements? (if mana are nanorobots, heat them and you will have the constituent of the nanorobot for instance)

After all of these experience, and a lot of work on the theory, I think a good laboratory of a few people can have a really good idea of what mana is. If quantum and statistical theory are known, the result of the spectrum and an equation of state can really show what are mana. I'm sure you will have other idea of experience.

Other random idea : what is the law of concentration of mana in function of altitude ? if mana is influenced by gravity, and pressure, these can explain easily why the concentration increases inside the planet. Do mana exist in space? launch a satellite with mana experiment on it. If mana have a spectrum, can we detect mana in the sun ? in other star ? a possible detection of life/magic in other solar system ? If mana is made of mundane element, can we destroy mana to extract matter ? if mana is made in part of platinum or gold ....

Where the energy of mana come from? Are mana radioactive? what is the comportment of mana against a radioactive material? Where can we put mana in the periodic table? What happens in a electromagnetic field ? Can we accelerate mana-particules inside a accelerator ? So many questions, so many !science! ....
