  ^{4} I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north---an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, ^{5} and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, ^{6} but each of them had four faces and four wings. ^{7} Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. ^{8} Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, ^{9} and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved.

  ^{10} Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. ^{11} Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. ^{12} Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. ^{13} The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. ^{14} The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning.

  ^{15} As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. ^{16} This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. ^{17} As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. ^{18} Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.

  ^{19} When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. ^{20} Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. ^{21} When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

  ^{22} Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. ^{23} Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. ^{24} When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,^{[b]} like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.

  ^{25} Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. ^{26} Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. ^{27} I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. ^{28} Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.

  This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.

No fractals, just the LORD in his eldritch glory.
