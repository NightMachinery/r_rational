Compared with last week's 500 word teaser, this is a monster at 3,300 words and it advances the plot quite a lot and is the longest section of chapter 4.

I hope people are happy with the way we've handled this plot point - originally I wrote something that my coauthor informed me was identical to the same scene in Twilight so we rewrote that whole section, but I think it's better for it.

Next week's section might be ~36 hours later than normal as I'll be travelling. (More likely I'll post it just before I leave and nobody will notice the difference.)
