All right, let's break this down:

- Plot: so far, it's a pretty generic "get pulled into a video game" plot crossed with a generic rescue plot. This early, "generic" isn't a bad thing: it allows you to set reader expectations so that they can be subverted later. I'm hoping to see some interesting subversions of the standard conventions of those plots.
- Setting: not much to say yet: the "real world" feels real from your descriptions, but the interesting part of the setting is the game, which we haven't delved very far into yet
- Characters: I really like the interaction between the main character and his sister; in fact, I think that's the story's biggest strength right now. I think the story got a bit weaker when she disappeared; hopefully, she's found soon, or the new character (again, too early to say much about her) is able to establish a similar rapport.
- Themes: I've spotted a few candidates for the core themes of your story (it's clear "family" is going to play a large role), but, again, early.
- Writing quality: Very good: good introspection by the characters, good reactions to events and conversions, and all around, it seems to be well-structured.

In short, a good start; I hope to see more interaction between characters now that you've established the combat system, and I'm interested to see where you're taking this plot.
