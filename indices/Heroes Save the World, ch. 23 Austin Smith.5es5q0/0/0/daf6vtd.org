Yes indeed!

[[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/825176040/strange-nations?ref=user_menu][Strange Nations]] is a Kickstarter that I ran last year. The book that it produced is going to be released (for free) in January.

I also wrote a revised edition of the Cyclopedia, which I'll be releasing the month after, and as you can see from the Kickstarter page, there's another series of booklets that I've worked on, How-To Cultures, which boils down the common traits between cultures that developed in the same environment but without necessarily influencing each other (e.g. the horse nomads of the Eurasian Steppe and the American Great Plains). The idea is that you can use this to build a culture that makes sense without having to model it after any one culture.

I'm also working on something called Species Shock, a forty or fifty page long look at an alien species that covers everything from the chemical makeup of their blood to popular forms of art. Also, info on their homeworld and native wildlife. Like Strange Nations, it'll be in the Creative Commons, free for anyone to drag and drop or modify for anything, commercial or noncommercial, so long the same privilege is perpetuated forward.

(I actually need to get around to adding the CC license to Heroes Save, too. I put it on everything but my nonfiction these days.)

I'm working on some other projects too, but after my laptop and backup hard drive were stolen early this year and I lost my notes on them, I've been set back to square one (I put everything on the cloud now, and may start sending weekly updates to a couple of people so they have my notes too).

Lastly, I used to maintain a blog called [[http://whitemarbleblock.blogspot.com/][White Marble Block]], where I posted stories, articles from the columns that I wrote (one personal, three for RPG.net at different times, and one for Sanitarium Magazine), and other stuff. I'm going to be launching a Patreon campaign in January for HSTW and my resource projects (Strange Nations, the Cyclopedia, etc), and as I get more funds I'll revive a couple of columns, start writing some other short stories (right now, my shorts and novels are being written purely for the market, but I'd prefer to be able to let everything be free on the Internet and get my funding via Patreon), and bonus chapters for HSTW.

The [[http://whitemarbleblock.blogspot.com/][About]] page has some story recommendations, but as it notes is under renovation and hasn't been fully updated yet. Since I've been using it for some time now, the stories range from "My god, I wrote thaaat?" to stuff that I still like.

Oh, and I'm also heavily rewriting an old contemporary fantasy novel that I wrote a few years, and sketching out a second, unrelated novel. I'm going to be shopping them around rather than posting them like HSTW, but AFAIK (and I'll be double checking for sure!) it isn't technically "publishing" them to allow my Patreon subscribers to access them, in the same way that posting them on a locked forum doesn't count as publishing.

(Written on my mobile, so I apologize if there's a spelling error here somewhere.)
