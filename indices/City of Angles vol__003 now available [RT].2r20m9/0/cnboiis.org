Hi, folks. Since the [[/r/rational]] community latched on to City of Angles some time ago I figured I'd drop in and let you know that the final book in the trilogy is now available!

This includes all the chapters currently available on the website, as well as author's notes about the process of writing each story, and a bonus epilogue story taking place in the future which details the ultimate fate of the City as told through Dave and Kelsey's daughter Riley.

The compiled retail version of the book is available in print or Kindle ebook formats. As always, it's also free on the site, outside of the book-only extra material.

Side note, my other rational-leaning series [[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint][Floating Point]] is still ticking along in volume one, and I've started posting drafts of the third chapter.
