I liked a lot of the story so far. My tentative assumption is that the story is actually about a simulated reality (hence, antibodies->maintainer of simulation, vs. presumably viruses).

I feel like Erica's characterization is inconsistent - it feels like sometimes she's a reasonably intelligent 18-to-22 year old with a series of really odd interests, and other times she's a fairly standard 9-year-old.

The simulation hypothesis suggests a logical explanation of the various place names and reasons for the more fantastical setting elements (e.g. this is a simulation of what a AI takeoff could look like, set up because of quibblers, hence Quibbletown etc. Honestly, if that is what you're going for, a bit more subtlety might be called for - unless it's a red herring and the truth /really is/ 'aliens' or similar, I see no reason for a simulationist to present labels like that internal to the simulation seemingly simply to point out that is in fact a simulation. Also, the idea that White has less AI to him and his existence outside school than a 2014 Sim or Skyrim NPC seems slightly silly all things considered.

The guess about the simulation is sort of preventing a lot of criticism of the setting and realism of certain characters' actions etc. I can't really say "this portrayal is obviously silly/unrealistic/etc" when the setting is supposed to be unreal in very obvious ways.

To other readers: Turning off javascript for the page while reading turns off all the "suggestions for editing stuff" along the side of the page, improving page performance and removing distractions, so I recommend doing that while reading esp. if you have e.g. noscript installed. Click on the "single page" text at the bottom of the first chapter to get the whole thing in one page instead of broken up into many small pages for no reason (first chapter only - later chapters are presented whole by default)
