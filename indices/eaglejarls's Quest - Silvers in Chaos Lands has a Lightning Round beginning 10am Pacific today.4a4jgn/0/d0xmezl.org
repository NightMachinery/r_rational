Here's an after action report on it from my perspective as the author:

This was the first time I'd done anything like this, and it was surprisingly intense. There was a sense of urgency that is missing from normal writing. I was mentally exhausted when the two hours ended, although I didn't realize it had ended until the buzzer rang.

It was also a lesson in quality awareness; I didn't have time to choose the right word or polish things, or even to fix typos. (I did anyway, because it was almost physically painful not to.)

Flow was very easy; I wasn't reaching for words or having trouble thinking what should happen next. There were a couple of scenes that ended up much shorter than I thought they should be; I think I spent too much time fixing typos or improving words. There was one scene that I didn't finish in the allotted 5 minutes, so I cheated by using the 10 minutes that should have been the voting period.

Speaking of shorter than expected, I was surprised at the variance in how much I was able to produce. Here are the approximate word counts for the 8 "chapters" that were released:

- l1.html: 141
- l2.html: 242
- l3.html: 243
- l4.html: 370
- l5.html: 188
- l6.html: 224
- l7.html: 447 (*) This is the one that I took extra time on.
- l8.html: 187

Keeping details straight was difficult. In the heat of the moment I didn't think of the fact that the Elves don't speak English, so now apparently their Lord has translation magic. I also wasn't sure if I'd kept the death count correct; turns out I did, but that was more luck than anything else.

I'm pleased at the quality of the writing that came out; it's not as good as what I normally produce, but there's a lot worse out there.

All in all this was a very positive experience, and I would do it again if people were interested. I asked the players what they thought about it; the responses were [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5609535/][generally positive.]]
