So this isn't really the point of this subreddit, and generally I'd suggest posting questions like this to Off Topic threads or the discord general chat channel :)

But it sounds like your friend just has poor epistemology regarding what he believes and why. From your below post, it sounds like he's basically a conspiracy theorist, and that's a worldview that's hard to change because it relies on distrust of "official" sources of data or research.

What you can try doing is asking him what would change his mind. If he can't come up with anything, there's your answer: his beliefs aren't based on falsifiable argument or evidence If he cites something that can be proven, try focusing on that. If he cites something outlandish and nearly impossible to demonstrate, examine his other beliefs and ask why he doesn't hold them to the same standard.

Or other conspiracies for that matter. Is he a global warming denier? Is he a moan landing hoaxer? If not, why not? Draw parallels.
