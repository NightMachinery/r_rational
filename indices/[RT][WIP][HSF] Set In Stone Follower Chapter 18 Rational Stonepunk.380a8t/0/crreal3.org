This is a challenge to the people on [[/r/rational]]! FarmerBob1 is about to write future chapters involving war tactics from Rikard and Allen, who don't have experience with battles.

This is a test of your skills as a rationalist.

What would you consider for war tactics?

Here's my own contribution which I posted on the FarmerBob1's site!

  Tactical Ideas:

  Is there a reason that they are waiting to be the one attacked instead of preemptively attacking? Sure it would be a horrible idea to send the army against the city, but sending some scouts to set fires and ruin some military equipment would be good. Or did they mention it and I forgot?

  I noticed that people keep saying that if there was spare food from a good enough harvest, they would send it to New Tokyo. If New Tokyo is naive enough, maybe they could send in poisoned food (or something else as a Trojan horse) under that very premise? Puking enemies are easier to hurt. I'll be surprised if they remember Greek mythology from thousands of years ago.

  I recommend looking up Mongolian tactics because Allen's side is very much a nomad-like army with more mobility than the civilians/army from the city of New Tokyo. Some possible tactics are spreading rumors exaggerating the size of their armies, having specialized units to break up the enemy, forging letters from a higher authority (Albert in this case instead of a king/Pope) ordering their surrender, using straw dummies on top of spare horses to enhance the size of the army from far off, enforce extreme discipline and honesty among the soldiers, not allowing their leaders to engage in the fighting, keeping the same leaders on high ground to best observe the battle, and some others from the Wiki page [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_military_tactics_and_organization]].

  A suggested improvement on the suicide-horse idea is to load the horses with hay or some flammable material and set the horses run towards the enemy while on fire. Everything's better with fire!

  Why are they not recruiting people from the martial arts community?

  Even if there is not enough time to make the soldiers into experienced fighters, people are shockingly bad at knowing simple stuff like not tucking thumbs into their hands when punching, to punch/kick beyond the target to put more weight and force when contacting, how to properly keep balance when attacking and other little things. I learned a lot from the first week of classes when learning Ta-Kwon-Do and the soldiers would be able to pick it up within a day or two with more motivation and time to spend practicing.
