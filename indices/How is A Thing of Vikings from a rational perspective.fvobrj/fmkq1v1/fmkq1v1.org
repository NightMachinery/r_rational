I just read this (the entire thing in 3 days) and I liked it a lot. The villains all seem to be responding in basically rational ways (conditional on a refusal to consider universal suffrage for serfs and/or personhood for dragons). However, technology upgrades are not the focus of the plot. Instead, the author is describing the process of escaping from a bad social equilibrium. By domesticating dragons, Hiccup has created a new strategic game. This is mirrored in the various personal relationships, which thrive when the characters adopt permissive multicultural views and struggle when characters condemn others or reject compromise.

There are a few repetitious character beats: Hiccup needs to be talked into using his genius to craft weapons (or talked down afterwards). There are also a few relationship misunderstandings that could've been avoided with straightforward communication.

On the other hand, there are some very engaging dilemmas. The main cast is not always right, and at least one plot point hinges on the ability of another character to make long term plans better than the MCs. (Actually, perhaps /many/ plot points rely on this.)

The story is rational in that it has characters acting intelligently in their own interests. However, there is not the kind of meta-narrative about the character's own intelligence that often gets praised in the rational fics I'm familiar with. The story isn't really about the /discovering/ of new technology. Instead I'd say the story is about how those new innovations change the incentives of existing players in a well-established dynamic equilibrium.

It's also worth saying that the good guys have a huge first-mover advantage; the antagonists are on the back foot for many hundreds of thousands of words. I found the existing work very engaging regardless, and the length has the benefit of illustrating the stakes when the situation escalates to existential threats. (And the number of existential threats is still growing!)

The format of opening each chapter with a blurb from historical sources set hundreds of years in the future is one of my favorite conceits.

TLDR: Long, well written work that has well identified character incentives but does not focus on technology upgrades or “schemes” by the MC like some other rational fics.
