Very interesting chapter, but the end was really weird. Considering the scale of the situation and the increase in physical and mental stats of the adventurers, pushing for school seems ... pointless, both because of its utility and because the intelligence of high-level adventurers should be way more than high enough to trivialize even the highest-level human education.

EDIT: in addition, while the standard submissive reaction to parents might have been understandable while he was much younger, at the current age and with the experience he had with surviving in a different world as a team leader, it's just feels ... off.

Also, what's with the immediate obsession of all parents of returned adventurers pushing for school? I understand that asian parents are obsessed with it, but this is way beyond even that.
