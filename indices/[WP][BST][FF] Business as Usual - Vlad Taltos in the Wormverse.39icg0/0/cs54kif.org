The Plot is defined. The basic structure is designed.

The plot and structure seemed amenable to a prologue, so a prologue has been written.

Vlad has been introduced, and, hopefully, been made interesting enough and identifiable enough that readers want to immerse themselves in his identity.

The initial setting that Vlad comes from has been described, and, finally, with a fair amount of stress, conflict, and action, Vlad has been forced to move forward into Chapter 1. The tone has been set as action fiction, and we're primed for another action scene to start chapter 1. Next, I design the first scene in the first chapter.
