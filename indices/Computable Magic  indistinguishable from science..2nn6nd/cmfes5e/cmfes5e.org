Funny thing is, for the last few weeks I've been working on something that is superficially pretty similar -- mana is a finite resource, it can be imbued into physical objects, etc. I called it "aetheric constructs" instead of "spell weaves" but same thing.

I bounced this off of a couple people including [[/u/alexanderwales]] and between us we came up with a few things. So, looking for further points of congruence:

- What generates mana? The gods exhausted it, now it's back. There must be something creating it.
- If you can imbue it into physical things, that means you can love it around. My 'verse will include pipelines where mana has been infused into water so it can be moved from mana factories / areas of high natural generation to areas of lower availability.
- Can spells be made up on the fly?
- Can spells be imbued into magic items?
- Do spells run down?
- If spells do run down, can you install a tap that constantly feeds them mana so they keep running?
