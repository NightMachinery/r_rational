I've got very little feedback about the change to the type of updates so I'd appreciate if people who care would respond to the poll: [[https://www.strawpoll.me/18124517]]

If you want to read the whole chapter at once, you can start from the beginning of it here: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/44081116]]

So, this section has Red asking some more questions about the whole vampire thing (since that is, you know, a bit concerning as we've established).

I'm interested in how people think we handled the "so you've killed people?" / "yes" part of the conversation. I knew William wouldn't lie, because he wouldn't think that Red would believe him if he said he hadn't killed people in a thousand years of life - and also it would be very easy for Red to find out about the lie later on. I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with the way we had Red accept it, and honestly Red probably doesn't entirely accept it (because how can you), but here we are. He's stuck between rocks and hard places, and at the moment William is probably his safest option.

I'd be interested in peoples' thoughts though: if you were in Red's position, what would you do? Do you think it's logical for Red to act this way, or is he holding the Idiot Ball a bit?

--------------

The chapter in all is centered around Red learning the BIg Secret and having to figure out his next move, so to speak.

The theme of having to rush somewhere, to act clandestinely, is what we're going to touch on in next week's interlude, which is going to be a flashback into Red's life (sorry if people wanted more vampire culture interludes!).
