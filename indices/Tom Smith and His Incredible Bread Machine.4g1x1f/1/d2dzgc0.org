So, I guess we mine as well go into why anti-competition laws exist, but first let's clear up a few things the poem got wrong.

1) Charging more than your competition isn't price gouging. /Colluding with your competition to set a high price is price gouging./

2) Setting the same price as your competitors isn't necessarily collusion. In competitive industries, prices will always be right around each other, because charging more will just make consumers choose your competition. It's collusion only when you price gouge (see above).

3) Charging less than your competition isn't unfair competition, as every off-brand product maker can attest. Charging less than your competition's (and your own) /cost/ to make the product is unfair competition.

So, why do these laws exist?

1) Because while it can theoretically be Pareto optimal to collude to set the monopoly (high) price, it isn't seen as fair. A society where businesses are free to collude is one where the consumer pays exactly what the maximum amount that they are willing to pay is. That doesn't sound /too bad,/ until you start applying it to necessities.

2) Again, see above.

3) This seems to be the least valid point, and it is. Unfortunately, large companies like Wal-Mart had a tendency to come into smaller towns, set their prices extremely low, (experience a temporary loss on each sale) wait for the neighborhood supermarket to go out of business, and then raise their prices. The government decided that that was bad (and it is), so they instituted that section of anti-trust laws. If businesses have negligible start up costs, then there wouldn't be a need for these laws.
