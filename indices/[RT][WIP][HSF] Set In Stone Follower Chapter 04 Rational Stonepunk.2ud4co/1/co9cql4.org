One reader was kind enough to point out some perceived problems with the story from a rationalist point of view. Here are my responses. If anything isn't clear, you might want to look at the link itself.

Q) Physically attempting to “coerce another to do your will” is wrong, but Albert gives a free pass when someone attempts to do the same economically.

A) Albert does not care what humans do economically or politically, provided that any who resort to violence repeatedly are removed from the gene pool by being sent to the prisons. He is not trying to make vast, sweeping changes to the human genome. He's trying to naturally select for nonviolence with as little impact on human genetics as he can, while keeping them at a technology level where they are unlikely to be able to effectively resist him.

Q) After all, the NT people aren't going to force the SL people to starve. So if an SL person physical forces away three NT people, then that SL person would be branded and have to spend the rest of their live in a prison camp.

A) If there is a fight, and the one who instigated the fight was sixteen or older, they would have an adult fighting infraction placed upon them, true. However, it is very possible and permissible to defend oneself and/or one's possessions, as long as your intent is to protect someone, or something valuable. If an NT person walks up to a SL person's granary and tries to take a bag of grain, and the SL person and their family restrains them, then there was not necessarily a fight. If blows are exchanged, then Albert would interview all involved, and determine who lost control and started the fight. Think of it like fouls in a basketball game. There are all sorts of permissible ways to physically pressure your opponents, but if you go over the line. Bam. Foul. Three fouls as an adult, and you're out of the gene pool.

Q) Look, only mentally ill people harm themselves, right?

A) Wrong. I would harm myself to protect my family. I suspect you would too, unless you come from a truly dysfunctional family. I would also harm others who are not my family, in order to protect those that are my family. Not as a first choice, but if I have to choose, my family wins.

Q) Albert should be attempting to get everyone to see everyone else as part of the greater whole.

A) No, you are misunderstanding Albert's goal here. Removing the potential for conflict does not alter how humans deal with conflict, when that conflict does inevitably happen. He cannot select against something that he never allows to happen.

Q) Albert is carrying a strong stick, but he doesn't seem to be using any form of carrots and a carrot/stick combination always work out better than just a stick.

A) Albert provides infallible law enforcement when called upon. He provides knowledge when requested. He provides guidance on genetic policy. While it has not been clearly indicated, he modifies pest species, controls invasive species, and prevents extinctions when he is asked to help doing so. He mostly stays aloof, and people who are in positions to get his attention generally don't want to get his attention unless they really can't handle a situation themselves, and it's serious.

Q) Albert has already made it clear that he's just fine with selfishness, which really seems the wrong tact to take when you're trying to encourage everyone to love each other and treat each other like close family, and also contradictory when you're fine with selfishness that hurts other people but don't favor selfishness that introduces a net gain.

A) It becomes clearer that we are having a nature vs. nurture argument here. Albert does not want a world without conflict. He wants a world where conflict is resolved without violence. The only way to prevent all conflict is by enforcing perfect stasis, which is not something that he wants to inflict on humanity.

Q) (#17): When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice. -> Albert never asks any of the people that represent him for advice. In fact, if they ever attempt to communicate with him for any reason at all, they are deemed to have failed. (#32) I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by. -> Nobody wants to give any message to Albert for any reason, because it will mean that they have “failed” and the “trapdoor” might very well open underneath them --- they might be back working in the fields.

A) Albert is able to tell when those responsible for calling him are doing so because they are being lazy or are no longer mentally competent. When he does seek out replacement contacts, he specifically seeks out people who are patient, competent, thoughtful, and confident. I don't think it would hurt things too much to reveal a little early that Albert will never remove someone from office that requests his attention for something worthwhile that they truly do need help with - and his chosen contacts know it. The contacts are forbidden to tell others about the real limits on them, because that would cause conflict between the contacts and the people they represent, as people constantly try to sidestep the authority of the contacts to get to the 'real' authority. By being aggressively passive, Albert is actively resisting humanity building a nanny state around him.

Q) Surely there are people in the world, far outside the normal realm, who have plenty of surplus food this year and would want to make some money by selling it to other people. They should be able to transmit a message, ship most things by sea. They have two months to get the message out and arrange things until the regular harvest is done. With other areas already willing to provide assistance, they should be able to get the message out and get some massive shipments of additional food/stuff before winter hits.

A) There are no agricultural areas where locusts are not active because locusts are the primary mover of biological metals from seaside to internal lands. Most of Nirvana's land is concentrated in a Pangea-like continent with a long north-south inner sea splitting the supercontinent apart. The split continent is centered fairly close to the equator. Transport is not a serious problem. If arrangements could be made for food, that food could be delivered. There are a great number of sailing ships, and they would have immediately put out to sea or temporarily sunk when the forerunner locusts were reported.

Q) If people generally stick to the reasonable “I need labor in the future, you need food right now, let's work something out”, it shouldn't be a major problem.

A) Indentured servitude is not a typical practice on Nirvana. Nirvanans know the history of the human condition quite well, and anything that even smells like slavery is going to make them very nervous because slavery is almost always accompanied by violence. Indentured servants, treated well, aren't a problem. However, most people on Nirvana who might have an interest in taking on indentured servants already have employees.

Q) Lots of questions about law enforcement and the prison system.

A) For the prison system, imagine early Australia. The prisoners are dropped off, and that's that. Males on one prison island, females on another. Zero crossover of sexes at either prison, including visitors, or staff. If the prisoners don't work, they don't eat. They are not forced to work like slaves, but they have to be productive. Escapes are not unheard of, but they are rare, because there is very little unmonitored traffic to and from the prisons. The prisons are designed to take people out of the gene pool, but they aren't gas chambers. They perform useful work. They grow food for themselves, and produce some simple exports to keep them from being a significant burden on the world economy. The permanent prisons are not heavily populated. For typical lawbreakers, there are jails that aren't prisons. If someone kills a single person in a fight, they might be sentenced to life in a jail, and allowed conjugal visits. Go to the prison islands, and all your sex will be with same sex partners, or yourself, even if you strike up a friendship with staff.
