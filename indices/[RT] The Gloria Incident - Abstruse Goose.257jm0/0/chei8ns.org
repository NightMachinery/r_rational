I really like this.

I don't have much education, but I have enough education to get an idea how much I don't know and how much I don't understand about the world. I don't really like to use those stoner sounding cliche words to describe the world, so let's try this: ~99,9% of the stuff I personally witness is normal e.g. it resides in the mental category of 'normal'. For that very reason I wouldn't call it "marvelous" or "bizarre". But for much of that stuff I don't understand very well how it works on a fundamental level. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Some of it might as well be magic for me, but still "normal". And this realization gives me an interesting feeling.
