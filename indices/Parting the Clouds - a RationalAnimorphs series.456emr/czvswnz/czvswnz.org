I read most of the books (missing two). Conclusion is that it probably isn't worth your time if you've already read Animorphs, but if you /haven't/ then it's a very good substitute for the original books, considering that (1) the books aren't easy to find anymore and (2) this series gets rid of most of the garbage (like shrinky-dink aliens).

Unfortunately, it's also a good substitute for the books because /very little actually changes/. There are no butterflies. Cassie is attempting to be a rationalist but the only divergence from canon is in little details. Some passages even appear to have been lifted wholesale from the books, though this is based on recollection rather than live comparison and I might be wrong.
