Okay, so if we assume the existence of the characters as strange loops/mental models/spark-of-the-divine via osmosis is dependent on the effort spent running them, the obvious strategy is to try and increase the prevalence of works featuring them and the fandom it generates (there are feedback effects due to fanfics).

Survival, thus, pretty much depends on the efforts of Tailsteak. This isn' t as insurmountable as it seems if you are willing to get into an ouroboros situation; once in "the real world", pay some guy to draw a comic chronicling your experiences with very specific instructions...

This does have a problem if the real world through the doorway doesn't count as very much "existence" for you.

If you were Tailsteak, however (who you could sort of argue is a "character"), you have much more options. While it would be hard to write a /direct/ continuation to what is obviously a fitting conclusion to the story, you could imply the characters' world through further shared canon or similar. But maximum efficiency would require promotion on a level which might not be easily attainable.

Ideally, you'd latch on to an existing work which has achieved institutional status, guaranteeing at least a Wikia page or two. (I'm not sure how exactly you'd go about this, but bribery seems like the most obvious option.) All the better if the work is metafictional, vaguely theological, and has a virulent, obsessive fandom...
