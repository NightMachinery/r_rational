You left off the philosopher's stone, which is one of the better options if you can get ahold of it. Also unicorn's blood, though we don't have enough details on the side-effects to judge properly.

For the most part, a lot of these depend on specific mechanics that we don't know, so their strength would be up the the whim of a fanfic author. For example: Personality overwrites. Does a spell or ritual or potion or some combination thereof exist that lets you swap bodies with someone while maintaining your mental "self" despite the changed brain structure (or changes it to match your original structure). If so then this would allow you to achieve eternal youth, if not then it wouldn't. Can you transfigure someone's brain into a copy of your own? Or otherwise create a perfect clone of yourself? If so then cloning would be useful, if not then it wouldn't. J.K. Rowling didn't say whether you can or can't, so we don't know.

An important detail we're missing is the effects of the Horcrux. It supposedly splits your soul, but what does that mean? Does it alter your personality? Kill part of your "self"? Do you lose some of your memories, desires, or emotions in the process? If so then it might not be worth doing and maybe you want to rely on the philosopher's stone, or maybe it's worth doing once but doing 7 times turns you into an evil psychopath and doing 20 times turns you into a gibbering imbecile who can't even cast spells anymore, or maybe you can cast it infinitely many times. The specifics determine whether you want to cast it 0 times, or 1 time which you hide extremely well like at the bottom of the ocean or flung into space, or do one at every opportunity and make horcruxes out of random pebbles.

The only things we actually know work in the universe that have people actually use them to obtain immortality are Horcruxes and the Philosopher's Stone, so I'm going to recommend doing both of those, and doing them more cleverly.
