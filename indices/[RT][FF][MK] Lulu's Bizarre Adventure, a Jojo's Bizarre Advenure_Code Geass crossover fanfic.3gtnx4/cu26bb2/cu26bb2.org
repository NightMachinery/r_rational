It's hard too imagine two characters as different as JoJo and Lulu, though judging from the introduction of Stand it seems like this is Stardust Crusaders Jojo-- I've only watched Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, after I've finished JJBA:SC.

Rational JoJo would be interesting to see. I can't possibly imagine how it would be done, given that JoJo lives in an irrational (or at least, bizarre) universe, but it could be fun.

Somehow, though, I think you'll never be able to beat the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BgqFYrD8UM][canon fights]] no matter what you do. You'll lose the magic of JJBA if you ever try to change it to be reasonable.
