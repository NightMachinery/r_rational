Interesting that the severance cuts something every time it moves. If it's not a target then it cuts the wielder instead. Saint was very careful with the use of her aspect bit now it's been forged into a weapon that makes it impossible to be as careful.

Combine that with the fact that the sword's cuts can't be healed properly, and we have a weapon that's even more dangerous to its wielder than its wielder's enemies. Just like the aspect was a danger to Saint as well, iirc.

The weapon doesn't need to go to a hero. It creates a story and role for anyone who wields it. The story involves a nasty disfigurement so it's as likely to be a villain as a hero. The GA do like their champions to be pretty after all.

Truly a nasty mcguffin they've all created.

That said, Cristophe may be the only one who /can/ wield it safely, unless there's someone else with as strong of a defensive ability we don't know about. The WK's fingers got nicked when he sheathed it, but the MK only had his sleeves cut when he unsheathed it. Safe being a relative term, since how safe can it ever be it to be around someone that volatile with a deadly weapon?

Truly truly a nasty mcguffin. (Technically not a mcguffin in this story, since it gets used in a plot relevant way a toaster couldn't be, but close enough. )
