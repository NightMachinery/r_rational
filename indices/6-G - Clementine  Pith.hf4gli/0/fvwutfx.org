I binged this story over the weekend and really liked it.

I do have to qualify that while the setting seemed fairly consistent, the character's motivations and actions were somewhat all over the place, and impossible plot-relevant things happened a lot. (I'm posting this since OP [[/u/madwhitesnake]] is the author, and I mean to offer constructive criticism, please let me know if it sounds otherwise)

Some examples:

- As this this chapter shows and stated earlier, Clementine is someone with experience in old school military, which is all "check your blind spots" and "confirm your kills". If my whole platoon was killed by some practitioner in my first encounter with magic, I wouldn't keep Pith-people as servants without nudging them to catalog exactly what wildcards they have in play. Sounds excessive, except the story emphasizes that Magic fighting is all widcards.

- A little earlier in the series, Anabelle learns to change people's Pith sense, at a time in her life where she has nobody to practice/test it on, and no clear reason to focus on this instead of anything else(say, sense of touch). She also regularly illusions around obstacles, into other people's fields of view, for sounds she might not hear herself, for an obscene amount of graphic detail, and for sights she cannot directly see. Partitioned down, you can see how that ability would be so much more broken if it wasn't just used to fool people and hide. Flashbangs, screeching noises, Sense of balance, etc etc.

- It's shown that practitioners can totally swap bodies with normies. Yet nobody is offering to swap old Gandhis into death row prisoners for free, or for cash. Annabelle essentially spends the whole series working on getting a body, when she could totes keep a backup from one of the droolers off the ship incident, ask her "I'm literally killing myself now" friend for a friendly body donation, caught murderers off the street, or asked her Praxis friend to research "how to craft wooden dolls we can occupy" ( these last things wouldn't have worked, but in-world, she should have been wrestling with trying for them :-( ).
