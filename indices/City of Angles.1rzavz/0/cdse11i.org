It's a webnovel that is not yet fully written and not rationalist per se. I think, however, that it is very smart fiction and the themes are quite interesting.

It's really really complicated to explain the premise without spoiling. There's this city that is kinda like an alternate dimension to which people from Earth are imported, and it's a very strange city. Randomly, new buildings can appear between old buildings; new lines of underground can be added, and the old ones rerouted; roads change direction; entire blocks swap places; the pumbling and electrical systems loop around with no origin for electricity or water but they come anyway; etc. It is a very strange city.

And then there's the Sideways, which is a part that is apart from even the city, to which you can only get if you walk entrances only visible from the corner of your eye. And in there, space isn't quite Euclidean, and weird stuff happens.

There is an overarching plot, and all the short stories of the book are within that plot and are related. They are also more or less chronological, and each more or less follows one character.
