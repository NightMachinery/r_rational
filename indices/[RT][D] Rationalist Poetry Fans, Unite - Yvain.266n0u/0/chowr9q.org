Inspired and took a stab after dinner. I am not a poet, and all oddities can be explained by reference to the most convenient rhyme....

If you wonder in Canterlot

The spell that feeds the rowdy lot

No pony sweats to break their back

To work the hoe without a slack

All crops as live ere turn to rot!

What can keep the ponies fed

Soundly sleeping in their beds?

“Widgets!” the purple pony declares

(“Pardon my mentor could not be there

Opportunity cost can be so tough

But Perhaps her assistant will know enough

To satisfy your questions”)

“Yes widgets and watches and wrenches and more

Parts and pieces you'll lose on the floor

Tiny and light like a whipped cream soufflé

Gone forever, you'll just have to pray”

Sample this piece, she says, and she thrusts into your hands

A curious contraption the texture of sand

“In water it magicks---it's a salt for bath!”

You nod politely, unsure of the path

Of this twisted pony's logic.

“Canines eat by doing dog tricks,

Cities nourish from the same store

By building for less and selling for more

Canterlot is fed on...on...bath salts!

And wrenches and watches and widgets galore”

A flaw in her spiel you note with trepidation

For fear that this pony will burst into flammation

But reason compelled you, you must, you will

Ask how this can be true for Ponyville

Which sends its food to Canterlot

And reaps in return what the city wrought

One must win and the other lose

This the dismal science has proved

“Not at all, dear pony,” she says with a laugh

“Don't you know the world is quite vast?

Each pony unique in their own way

Endowments and goals, only they can say

Trade butter for guns and both ponies gain

We know because neither pony refrained”

The excited look in the econopony's eye

Gives you pause, and you begin to shy

Away from her and toward the door

And leave her study forever more

You cough and stammer a hasty goodbye

But to her books she's returned and pays you no mind

Songbirds sing as you breathe clean air

The sun hangs loose like it just don't care

You buy an apple, so fresh and firm

Tastes twice as sweet knowing how it's earned
