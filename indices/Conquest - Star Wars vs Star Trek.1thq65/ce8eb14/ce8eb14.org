This is basically exactly what it says on the tin, written by someone who has read Sun Tzu.

Every faction acts sensibly in pursuit of their own goals, leading to shifting alliances and confrontations between and within the United Federation (/Next Generation/), Rebel Alliance, Galactic Empire (an original version, headed by Emperor Anakin Solo), Romulan Empire, and Borg. It is mostly written as a high level, strategic view of an extended military campaign, jumping between a few viewpoints as it's convenient - this is not a character story, it's a politics story.

And it's a /blast/. Loads of fun. Lots of interesting technology comparisons with interesting applications, lots of intelligent characters making completely valid inferences using incomplete information, lots of getting things done with creative efficiency.

About my only complaint is that the only meaningful female character is not feminist-friendly. Like, distractingly so. Also, a lot of the dramatic irony never gets closure, as in reality. But if you can get past that, /Conquest/ is awesome. I'm not even especially fond of /Star Trek/ and it's a great read. So's the rest of the site! It examines the technology and tactics shown in both of the series, plus some general space and science topics. Most of the ability match-ups in the story come directly from the analysis you can find by clicking around.
