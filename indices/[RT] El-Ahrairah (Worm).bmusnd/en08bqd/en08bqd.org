This fic has a gotten a lot of detractors in the years since it came out, mostly because of the way it handles characters. I liked the idea of the fic at first, coming straight out of Worm, where the cast were so affected by conflict drive + personal flaws that they made life 100x harder for themselves than it had to be. Refreshing myself on this story when it dropped a couple of new chapters, I saw that it had lost its shine, and it took a while to figure out why I had trouble liking it as much as I did the first time around.

El-Ahrairah goes for the optimal rationalization route at the expense of character. I don't think I've ever seen a Taylor written to be as unlikeable as the one in that fic. The amount of condescending dialogue where she lectures adults twice her age... Man, it just took me out of the story and made me recognize that cool powers and rational protagonists are good and all, but investment in the characters requires a sympathetic protagonist.

This is what I mean by the dialogue:

  "It's true, Shadow Stalker," I said. "Incidentally, your actions against me earlier this month were a violation of your probation. Doubly so, in light of the fact that those actions induced a Trigger Event. The Protectorate was quite eager to score points with me by sacrificing you." I met her eyes; my power told me where they were, despite the mask. "But I plead your case, on the condition that you be watched more closely. You're scum, but your power is useful, and if I'm being honest I'm rather grateful that a cape was involved--the academic literature suggests that that's what made me a partial Trump. Still, make no mistake, Sophia Hess: you remain free only so long as I want you free. Now sit down and shut up."
