Essentially you can either try to get shallow feedback from a lot of people by engaging them on a fanfiction site by posting chapters, or deeper feedback from a smaller number of people by contacting them directly as betas/sounding boards.

If you want a mix of about 60% praise, 10% spelling and grammar corrections, and 30% discussion about various plot points, inconsistencies with canon, the mechanics of xyz ect, then post to SpaceBattles. SufficientVelocity is similar but you'll get about half the readerbase and replies. If you want very accurate statistics on viewer numbers, but far less actual feedback, post to fanfiction.net. If you want to spend more of your time uploading and updating stuff in return for more flexibility, post to all three. There are other sites, but to my knowledge their readerbases are far smaller which is sub-optimal for a first story. There's nothing particularly against tossing it out and starting from the beginning on any of the three platforms, indeed it happens fairly often.

As for betas, generally speaking these are people who want to spend their time doing this for their own reasons that are probably largely similar to the reasons writers have for writing fanfiction. Maybe they like the idea of contributing to something that makes people happy, maybe they enjoy helping out, maybe they have some other reason. At the end of the day, they're volunteering because they want to do this thing. So long as you're polite, don't act like an arsehole and credit them for their work then there's nothing to feel objectively uncomfortable about - as little as knowing that may help.

If you stick a little sign that says "looking for a beta." or similar at the start of wherever you choose to post, you'll likely get a volunteer before too long. Or just post "looking for beta" here in [[/r/rational]] and you'll likely get a bite or three. Otherwise you could find a writer/person who knows how to word good who is willing to look over your work, but at that point it's really just semantics whether or not they count as a beta. There are a couple of writers I know of who post in their thread in order to get a different beta every time, which is more random in what quality you end up with. Choosing any of the options outlined above does not necessarily preclude you from also taking the other options as well.

Any more specific questions?
