I'm glad to see this here- it's something I've thought about doing myself, but didn't really have the drive to spruce up the canon. I might throw out a few thoughts. Turians are... interestingly different, but I'm not sure why the departure from canon was necessary. Would there be lone agents or are they all cells of networked individuals by necessity? Can they telepathically communicate with other species? Will you consider the Asari telepathic also? I do wonder how you'll explain biotics and showcase their powers. I found "Jarvis" pretty jarring, and it about killed my suspension of disbelief. The tech otherwise was well-enough described to hold my interest and actually /felt/ futuristic. But having to verbally command an interface when you have mental implants seems like an inefficient way of doing things, and less than useful if you want to issue the necessary verbal commands while you need to remain undiscovered. The dialogue is a little bit unnatural, in my opinion - I would be quite fine with more contractions. There's some capitalization errors, but that's a quick edit and something that didn't bother me overmuch. I have to wonder if you're planning on following the plot and forcing it to make more sense or if you're optimizing it. I always dropped my suspension of disbelief around the part where an audio file is sufficient evidence to conduct a manhunt, Shepard is convinced with minimal evidence that there is an evil plot to destroy galactic order, and the Council is ever unwilling to update on new information with only the hand-waviest excuses given (it's politics, they're not allowed to take potential existential threats seriously, that's all!) I did feel like, overall, the introduction was less boring than actually playing the tutorial would be after the first time. Plus, mechs just make more sense for a small strike force, though I want to know how you use them without being seen. Or heard. Or detected electronically. But in all, I hope something interesting and sensible can come out of this. If I may ask, have you written any more on this?
