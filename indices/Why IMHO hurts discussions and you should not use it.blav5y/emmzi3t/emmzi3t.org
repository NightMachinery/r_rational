I think this is going a bit overboard. Sure, technically /everything we say ever/ is "just our own opinion", but of course, we hold some beliefs more certainly than others. The way I see it, if I use "IMHO", I'm just stressing that I'm aware of the subjectivity of whatever it is I'm about to say. There are things that I believe to be objectively true, despite that too being technically "my opinion" about them. On those things I may get more confrontational or argue more. If I prefix something with IMHO it means I'm not so certain about it, or I consider it an opinion belonging to the realm of subjectivity (such as aesthetic tastes).
