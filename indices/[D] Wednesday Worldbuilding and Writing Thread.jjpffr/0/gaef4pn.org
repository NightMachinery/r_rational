I'm not sure if this belongs here, or in the Saturday munchkinry thread, so apologies if I'm in the wrong spot.

I've been working on a Harry Potter/Kingdom Hearts crossover for a while now, and I'm trying to think through interesting ways for two different soft-magic systems to interact. I'll assume most people are familiar with HP magic, but to give a little context for Kingdom Hearts:

Kingdom hearts has weapons called 'keyblades' which can be summoned at any time and lock/unlock any lock. Keyblade wielders can usually do elemental magics, throw fireballs, call lightning, etc. They also have a generic 'magic shield' ability. The setting also has generic light and dark magic with what one might expect in terms of associations with creation/healing and death/decay respectively. Pretty much all magic in this setting is combat based.

There are only two hard rules I have entirely made up so far.

1. Defensive magic trumps offensive magic. E.g. A /protego/ spell protects against most keyblade attacks, and a keyblade guard protects against most spells. (this is balanced by both sides having access to both types of magic)
2. Dedicated functions trump general functions. e.g. /Avada Kedavra/ still goes through keyblade guards, and keyblades can unlock magically locked doors.

So far in fights, keyblade wielders try and get close and keep the wizard from casting, but if they're pushed back they have trouble blocking/undoing the more esoteric wizarding attacks. However, a few people have both types of magic [Harry has a keyblade, Voldemort has The Power of Darkness^{tm} ] and I'm still trying to figure out how those fights might go.

Any thoughts on the magic systems, or how you think the settings might go together would be greatly appreciated!
