So are we posting stuff like typos here?

I don't often notice actual typos, but word repetition is what jumps to me the most.

There was an overexposure of "nodded" at the start. With almost two identical "nodded" sentences back to back.

This also seems strange.

#+begin_quote
  There was also *the fact that*, despite *the fact that* I lived a life mostly defined by rigid routine
#+end_quote

It looks like it was supposed to be "was more about" or "was defined by __ more than", but they got mixed.

#+begin_quote
  my academic career was *defined more about* the pursuit of understanding than the pursuit of knowledge
#+end_quote

Almost the same thoughts\explanation back to back.

#+begin_quote
  There was another thing that made the 'power' answer appealing.Earlier, Athena had mentioned that it was possible to ascend to higher planes of existence -- to perhaps become the same sort of entity that she was -- if I amassed enough power.

  I didn't remember her exact wording, but I was sure that she had used the word "power" as the means by which one might ascend to higher planes of existence
#+end_quote

Since he moved to the edge it makes sense that he just " peeked over" or "peeked over it".

#+begin_quote
  I cautiously moved to *the edge of the plateau, peeking over **the edge*
#+end_quote

I doubt the sudden teleportation was involved, so pointing out that it's the edge "of the plateau" is not really necessary. "The edge" should be enough.

#+begin_quote
  I moved around *the edge of the plateau*

  I realized my pacing *had been been* crawling

  I could observe at the moment, *my new body* might be the most interesting thing, and yet it was only now that I found myself consciously realizing how oddly comfortable I felt inside of *my new body*.
#+end_quote

"I guess i might" is sorta redundant, but i guess i might consider it being okay. Front limbs kinda = feet. Arms already include hands, or their are interchangeable.

#+begin_quote
  I studied what I guess I might consider my front limbs and feet, the analog of a human arm and hand
#+end_quote

Nail has a singular form or plural, it's now mix of two fro one thing.

#+begin_quote
  they looked more like a *carpenter's nails* than a human *fingernail*
#+end_quote

You have a tendency of repeating similar words\word pairings in the same paragraph and when dropping them completely. They would be fine if they were spread out, but if left as is they stand out.

#+begin_quote
  I tried whipping my tail around to examine it, but I couldn't turn my head very much, and the tail wasn't very long, so I could *barely make out the* shape of the tail's tip when I tried to bend it. The tail wasn't flexible enough to curl around, but I could sort of bend it enough *to make out the* fact that it was covered with the same gray leathery scales as the rest of my body.
#+end_quote

To say what? He is just describing an action to us.

#+begin_quote
  I checked my stat sheet -- it felt weird to say that, as though the stat sheet were just another part of my body

  suited *to* grinding plant life
#+end_quote

Okay, after noticing the tendency to repeat words, i can't unsee it.

#+begin_quote
  *For a brief moment*, I considered what I knew about dragons: dragons could fly, provided they had wings, but I apparently had none -- not yet, at least. Dragons could also breathe fire -- well, that seemed to be a skill that I lacked *for the moment*
#+end_quote

Okay, this one is mostly a nitpick or not?

#+begin_quote
  but *then again* I *hadn't exactly tried*. I opened my mouth, *and tried* to exhale in a menacing way, but nothing came out apart from warm air, and exhaling warm air was a feat that most mammals back on earth were capable of. *Then again*, maybe accomplishing a mammalian feat like exhaling warm air was notable.
#+end_quote

"Enough" repeats in the same sentence on two separate occasion in chapter 2.

Okay, it's funny at this point. That tendency of repeating words in the same paragraph or couple of paragraphs and not using them after is present with "came out" and bonus of "come out".

#+begin_quote
  I had just hatched from. If I had hatched from an egg

  I was in a position that would be difficult to climb to, *protecting me from predators*, a good place to hide *from predators*.
#+end_quote

This is more of a question, cause i usually forget this rule, but can't it be something like this " It\That meant I shouldn't assume (that) ---me being here\i was here-- was\is a result" So can you can reduce the repeated use of "that" and make it easier tor read?

#+begin_quote
  That meant that I couldn't take it as an assumption that I was here as the result of some matronly dragon
#+end_quote

"Come to think " also repeats.

#+begin_quote
  most fantasy stories about *dragons* didn't really focus on the early lifecycle of *dragons*
#+end_quote

Dragons overload.

#+begin_quote
  part from a few *dragons* that I'd seen in cartoons, the only infant *dragons* came to mind were Daenerys Targarian's *dragons*, and even then, I couldn't recall anything about how the *dragon* eggs that she had custody of came into existence -- Daenerys might be the 'Mother of *Dragons*,' but she probably wasn't the sort of mother I was looking for.
#+end_quote

Dragons and people overload.

#+begin_quote
  Looking at the mountain peaks around me, there didn't seem to be any *people* here eager to adopt a *dragon* -- or many *people*, period.
#+end_quote

The absence of *people* might be a good thing. I knew a lot of stories about *heroes* going into the mountains to slay a *dragon*, and significantly fewer stories about *heroes* going into the mountains to befriend a *dragon*. Perhaps this world was home to a few *people* who dreamed of peacefully co-existing with *dragons* and sharing some sort of mutual relationship where they got to enjoy *dragon* rides, but Athena had introduced me to this world saying that "This world is not always nice." It also occurred to me that even among *people* who did seek to co-exist with *dragons*, one of their chief motivations might be to cultivate *dragons* as an instrument of war, and being ridden into battle didn't strike me as a particularly strong survival strategy. *Dragons* maybe had it better than war horses, but war tended to be a zero sum proposition of the sort that I had spent most of my previous life avoiding.

#+begin_quote
  It was probably best to avoid *people*, at least until I understood this world better.
#+end_quote

Now it's time for the "odor" to repeat.

""Perhaps"" is repeating now.

Now it's ""inform"".

#+begin_quote
  which was *informative* in its own way. In addition to *informing* me about my current capabilities, testing my skills now could provide some illuminating *information*
#+end_quote

Part of the "perhaps" coalition.

#+begin_quote
  *Perhaps that meant* I was an orphan, *perhaps it meant* I was the offspring of one or more negligent parents, or *perhaps it simply meant* that any potential caretakers were further than my 'dragon-sense' could detect, out gathering food for their newly-hatched youngster.
#+end_quote

"Seemed" turn to shine.

#+begin_quote
  I tried *swinging my tail* around. As I stood on all four legs, *swinging my tail*
#+end_quote

Uhm, i guess it doesn't outright states it previously, but still, it was stated before.

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't turn my head very much, and the tail wasn't very long
#+end_quote

So it seems strange to have a sudden realization that his neck is shorter than the tail.

#+begin_quote
  it suddenly became clear to me that my tail was quite a bit longer than my neck
#+end_quote

It is "my tail" who's tail would it be if not his.

#+begin_quote
  was *important* if it was going to be a measure of my capabilities, but learning how to get comfortable in my own body was equally *important*
#+end_quote

I think it's obvious what is the problem with this one.

#+begin_quote
  The idea that my front claws' greatest use might be gripping the ground gave me an idea.

  several inches short of *the edge of the plateau*. I carefully got up and took several steps back before peering over *the edge of the plateau*
#+end_quote

He felt, it blink up, how exactly that works? It also should be present tense.

#+begin_quote
  I felt a notification blinked up
#+end_quote

You used something different to describe "the plateau" (this dirt and rock platform), but when fell back on just repeating "the plateau".
