Hmm. I'm not sure about that. I don't think they actually have any leverage at all. I'm pretty sure this is one of those things set up so Hyacinth has just enough plausible deniability that no one can pin it on her. These people don't play fair. Larkspur called in illegal aid from Doris Finch and an obscene over commitment of something like 5 helicoptors and 50 people to assassinate them. These people don't play nice or care at all about law/morals. Besides they already knew they were strong and powerful considering how they slaughtered that overcommitment. Its not new information.

That said the GM could have had it blow up in their faces if they said screw politics. It's impossible to know at this point. It's just frustrating because there were two moments where they almost played it genre savvy enough. First when Juniper suggested assassination and second when Juniper almost preemptively attacked Yarrow. Not a knock on the writing, I'd just personally take that as a sign that if the GM is going to escalate no matter how nice you play you should beat him there to grab what advantages you can. Hell every single time they've shown their enemies mercy in this story it gets thrown back in their face.
