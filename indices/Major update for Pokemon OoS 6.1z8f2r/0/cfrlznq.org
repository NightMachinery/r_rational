Much, much better, on all counts.

By expanding "chatting with neighbors" out into a quick scene, you've managed to characterize Laura as friendly and sociable, on a first name basis with many people. At the same time, you give us a taste of who Daisy is before we even see her. You show Pallet Town as a community - a close-knit, everyone-knows-everyone kind of place, maybe a bit frontierish. You give insight into your entire universe, showing that vicious and dangerous wild pokemon are uncommon but not rare. And on top of all that, you make a certain commenter feel really flattered! Amazing what you can do with just a few lines.

The post-dinner conversation is worlds better. In addition to being genuinely amusing, it also provides insight into the characters - most especially, Sam's connections, and how he might be in a privileged position to put information together, while simultaneously outing him as a doting father figure. I'm still hungry to know more about what's on the news... But of course, that was your intention, and I no longer feel cheated out of the exposition.

I like Daisy. She is principled, skilled, and amusing. She's also now participating in the central concept of your entire story, helping this chapter be more cohesive with the rest, and less jarring and pointless. And, just as importantly, /Laura keeps up/. She solves the problem herself once she has enough data. You've shown me that Laura can piece together puzzles, just as you've shown me she can network. You've sold me on the idea of her as a reporter, which was just an informed ability in the original version. She's also no longer obsessive, bringing up both Red and Tom at times when it makes sense, further selling her as her own person.

Well, that's enough of me telling you things you already know, having written the thing. Everything now feels like it exists for a reason, with nothing wasting my time. Cutting the constant random reminiscing probably helps the present tense feel more natural. The constant switching to past and back made grammatical sense, but like some other people, it felt clumsy to me. Now it feels fine. I would say that it is still a little bit choppy. I might like to see a few more longer paragraphs. Let me sit and relax with a thought for a little while and soak up some description. Like, the entire first half of the meal is kind of blink-and-you-miss-it. I mean, it's not that important, so maybe that's intentional, but it might be a part of the flow problems people were mentioning earlier.

You've brought this chapter from pretty meh to pretty good. Well done.

Petty specific complaints (mostly typos):

"you just happened to choose the one hotel and room that the President of Silph happened to be staying next door to..." is a pretty clunky sentence.

"*Surly* you won't turn every coincidental-"

"the melody shifts, *the* Moonlight always leading"

"*an* sound expert"
