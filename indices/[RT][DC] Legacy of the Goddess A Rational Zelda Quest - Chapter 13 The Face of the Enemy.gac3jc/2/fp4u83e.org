*[Plan: Split the Party]*

Similar to Plan Spire in the Sands, but we're splitting the party. I have a number of instructions for Zelda's +lackeys+ valued councilors to do back home. I'm welcome to any suggestions on how to improve.

*Action by either/both Champion:*

- Combine maps with Shesan and put points of interest (e.g. potential fragment locations, Link's vision locations, Gannondorf/his armies' locations, etc.) on the map. Attempt to plan an efficient route to visit the vision locations safely and rapidly. The plan is for Link + some companions to go to the *Obsidian Spire* first on the list unless another location is closer.
- Spend a day or however long it takes for Grenja and Malg to reach the Sunseeker camp discussing things with Shesan, resting, and restocking supplies. Use the time to discuss high priority items related to the spire itself or the journey there.
- Propose Marking Shesan as soon as we have sufficient Divine Power as a symbol of an alliance between your factions. Use this as a chance to also discuss what Shesan knows about Marks, Divine Power, and Old Magic.
- Izu is in charge of security for the remainder of the trip, Link needs to do Lightsworn stuff. While traveling with the reduced guard, have Zelda apply Luck to herself, using Fi to recharge MP if needed.

*Link Actions:*

- Link's visions probably qualify as *The Champion's Trials* (Chapter III). Discuss knowledge of these trials that may be relevant with Zelda and Seshan, such as common puzzles and threats. Especially note if the Champion needs to do everything solo. Pick up needed supplies for a trial while in town.
- Link + 3 Sheikah (Koja, Grenja, and Malg) + a possible Gerudo guide(s) head to the Obsidian Spire. 3 Sheikah is to cover the 3 magic types and include healing, CQC, and recon/infiltration. If Link prefers swapping in different Sheikah, except Laylith, then he can make that decision based on his best judgement.

*Zelda Actions:*

- Based on Zelda's dream, there might be a fragment in the Lost Woods. It's not like Shesan as many other leads. See if Shesan knows anything about significant locations in that area, and offer to coordinate sending a team to investigate.
- Check if Wymar has sent instructions on where he wants Naibi's soldiers deployed and pass it along to Naibi. Talk with Link, the Sheikah, Izu, and especially Naibi about how to keep Naibi's soldiers and Hylian soldiers from getting into fights. Promise Naibi that she'll do her utmost to make sure Naibi and her soldiers are treated with the full respect they deserve and to fairly address any grievance.
- Instruct Lensa and any other relevant council members (message via scry link) to gather information about how Hyrule contacted the Gorons in the past. If the location of a Goron settlement is known, then the plan is to send a messenger asking for assistance and warning about Gannondorf likely attacking them. If just a vague area is known, then plan is to send a Sheikah team to locate Goron settlements and then send a messenger.
- Instruct the relevant council members (possibly Nyllara as this is a legal/administrative matter and again via scry link) to prepare a list of abandoned baronies. Preferably one at the edges of the Floodplains as Zelda was already intending. Make sure to inform Naibi that you're working on locating a suitable plot of land.
- Send for Grenja & Malg (again via scry link) to come to the Sunseekers camp while Link and Koja prepare for the expedition.
- Zelda and the rest of the party not going with Link will return to Castletown by way of Last Bastion. Leave around when Link's expedition sets out.
- While stopping at Last Bastion, meet with High Captain Roesar. He ought to already know that the Sunseekers have promised soldiers to assist, so politely ask him to do his best to prevent altercations between Hylians and Sunseekers. If there are problems, then Zelda wants to be informed about it. We do not want her diplomacy wrecked because interpersonal conflict wasn't brought to her attention.
- Continue DODGE!!! training.

*Sheikah Allocation:*

- Get a message to Sheikah that is trailing Vesryn to see if they can rendezvous with Vesryn and make a truce. Order the Sheikah to cooperate with Vesryn in the search for the fragments, but to keep an eye on him. Make sure Shesan simultaneously contacts Vesryn to let him know we are combining our efforts. If Shesan has no way of contacting Vesryn, simply call our Sheikah off the search for Vesryn instead and reallocate them - we don't want a bloody mess if they try to make contact and it turns into a fight.
- Ask Sheshan to contact Golvara to meet with Zelda back in Hyrule. If he's stuck behind enemy lines, offer to send a Sheikah team to extract him. When we talk with him, we will want to inquire about the other locations Link saw, among other things of course.

*Discussion with Shesan - High Priority:*

- Ask if Morudo Geira could have formed a new avatar by now, and if so, what Shesan knows about how Gandondorf defeated it (and if there are any other strengths and weaknesses she knows about it). Also ask her if there are any Sunseekers that would be willing to guide us to the Obsidian Spire (Since most Gerudo hate talking about it asking around for a guide probably wouldn't go well). We should get as much info as possible.
- Share what we already know about the capabilities of groups of Wisdom fragments, although she probably already knows. See if she knows anything about the benefits of groups of Power and Courage fragments. Especially Power since Gannondorf has gathered most of them and Link or Zelda might end up in personal combat with him.
- Explain what we know about Marks and that that we wisht to mark additional people to generate Divine Power rapidly. See if she is willing to assist us with this process, by letting us mark her or her agents, for example, and if she has any ideas on how to do this more efficiently.
- Discuss our general understanding of Fi's abilities and Old Magic. See if she knows anything that could be useful for creating the foundation of new spells. Both the Fae and Morudo Geira seem to use something awfully similar to Sacrifice, but why use human sacrifice instead of something more ethical and sustainable? Is it important to use it in a specific location? Raise the possibility that Gannondorf is gathering the fragments to Sacrifice them to 'Demise'.
- Have Link ask Shesan if she knows anything about the current location and powers of the Sword of Evil's Bane. It sounds like the type of thing we might want to have against an entity as powerful as Demise, and Link would probably love having a magic sword. If we can find out where it may be located, put it on the map as a potential place to visit. If we believe there are prerequisites to claiming it, we can defer visiting it until after those prerequisites (e.g. being a full Lightsworn) are met.

*Discussion with Shesan - Medium Priority:*

- What can Shesan tell us about her own magic? She gave us a vision - how did that work? She knows a lot about us - is that through divination magic? What are the limits of it?
- Does her own form of magic offer any unique abilities that might help us reach fragments before Ganondorf, like flight or teleportation?
- Shesan mentioned that she did not think we could bond to the fragments of power. Why, is it because individuals can only attune with a single fragment type? What are the criteria for bonding with fragments? Magic affinity is likely connected, but are more soft things like personality also relevant?
- Ask what she knows about constructs (ie Fi) and what capabilities and nature constructs usually have. If constructs usually have some trait that Fi supposedly doesn't have, we might be able to expand her capabilities.
- Are there any more of her agents around, like Seff for instance? He did try to steal a fragment after all. We wouldn't want to get in each other's way.

*Discussion with Shesan - Low Priority:*

- Get a list of Sheikah agents that were working with Vesryn from Shesan. Make sure Fi is present when we are given the list. Compare to our list from the Sheikah interrogations. See if we made any mistakes in our trusted agents list.
- Ask what she knows about Lightsworn (She most know something since she's so sure that Gannondorf and Link weren't one). What can she tell us about the egg? The process of becoming a Lightsworn? The capabilities we should expect a Lightsworn to have?
- Ask her what she knows about Ja'bu. Is it a void entity similar to Morudo Geira? Did the Zora engage in ritual sacrifice like with Morudo Geira?

*Other:*

- Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.
- The reverse of the first bullet point is that Link/Zelda can siphon his/her mana to sheikah and then have Fi refill his/her reserve. I'd like to have both test if it is possible to say recharge Koja after doing healing or Malg/Laylith/Ryn after doing a bunch of Scrying & Telepathy (examples of what we could use them for). Are there physical or mental fatigue issues (beyond Fi running out of MP to refill)?
- Test if Fi can use Rejuvenate on non-marked individuals. Start with animals like horses after a days riding. Then move on to Sheikah, preferably Laylith since she's already partially in the know on Fi's existence. If it does work, have Fi analyze if there's a reduction in VP efficiency.

*Personal Research*

- Perform personal research from the prior chapter, as discussed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g6dqi0/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/folj79u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][here]].
