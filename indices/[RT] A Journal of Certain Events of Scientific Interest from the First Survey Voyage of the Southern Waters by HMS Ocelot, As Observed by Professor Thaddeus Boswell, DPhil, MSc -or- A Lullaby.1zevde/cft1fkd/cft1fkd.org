It's hard to find Rationalist fiction in the major publications, but I think this comes very close. Most importantly, conflict is due to a difference in values rather than good/evil. The rules are sane and consistent (and at least according to the author, modeled on the behavior of real-life bettas (aka Siamese Fighting Fish)). One main character does try to use scientific methods to clear up mysterious phenomena, and the story hints at transhumanist ideals.

OTOH, the problems aren't solved by the use of rationality insomuch as a combination of serendipity and keen observation. And the story does not resemble a puzzle the reader can solve. Idiot Ball is debatable, but I don't fault the Professor for being a product of his time.

In any case, it's close to Rationalist Fic, and it's a good story.

FWIW, I was guided to the story from [[http://anaealay.com/2014/01/08/cc-a-journal-of-certain-events-of-scientific-interest-from-the-first-survey-voyage-of-the-southern-waters-by-hms-ocelot-as-observed-by-professor-thaddeus-boswell-dphil-msc-or-a-lullaby/#comments][Anaea's review]], which may help you decide if you want to read it, while simultaneously being rather funny.
