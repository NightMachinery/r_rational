  So I'm working on a story. The main character has pretty much abandoned society due to painful interpersonal conflicts, but is an educated scientist with a broad education (PhD, biomedical engineering, Masters in Cybernetics). Early in this story he meets two people with superhuman strength and speed who do indeed feed on blood. The character continues to publish and do online consulting but doesn't have a high degree of disposable income. What kind of a lab might he have thrown together in the few years preceding and what should his first experiments be?

So wait, does he actually have a vampire he can run tests on? If not, consider that step one.

Things to research:

- Vampires need blood. What does that mean? There are multiple components to blood, and multiple types of blood. Do vampires need red cells, white cells, platelets, plasma, or some combination? Can they subsist on animal blood? Can they subsist on blood substitutes like PolyHeme? What is the minimum level of blood that can sustain a vampire?
- Vampires are (usually) weak to the sun. What does that mean? Are they weak to a specific type of light, like UV? Are they weak to reflected sunlight? Can their weakness to sunlight be negated in some way, like high SPF sunscreen?
- Vampires are strong and fast. What are the limits of their strength and speed? What mechanism provides them with this strength and speed? Does their strength and speed surpass their caloric intake (in the form of blood)? How close to human-normal are their vital signs, and how do those vital signs change with exercise?
- Vampires can (usually) make more of their kind. What physiological changes occur to make someone a vampire? Can vampirism be induced in flesh absent a connection to a human (say, a fresh organ)?

Depending on what rules are immediately apparent, there are a bunch more tests that you would want to do. Some vampires exhibit seemingly psychological conditions, like an inability to cross running water, recoiling from a cross, inability to enter a home without an invitation, etc. Some vampires can't be reflected in a mirror. These are all things that you would want to test in various ways; the experimental models would be pretty simple in the beginning. Some of the experiments you would want to do would be ethically questionable, or at least pose safety risks to your vampire, but the vampires would have a fairly high incentive to cooperate in order to expand their own knowledge and gain some sort of advantage.
