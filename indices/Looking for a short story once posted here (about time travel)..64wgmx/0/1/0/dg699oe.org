Your argument is well-reasoned, but there are three flaws/counter-agruments:

- Time travel only requires life with an advanced civilization, so it should only be resetting, at most, to the earliest point in time when complex life first appeared. Not back to shortly after the big bang where there is no life to take advantage of the time travel. For all we know, life does take 14 billion years to appear (a proposed solution to the Fermi Paradox).

- According to the Anthropic Principle, even if time travel frequently resets to an early point in time before human civilization appears, we can only observe universes that has managed to reach 14 billion years in age without resetting. Hence, we cannot take the age of the universe as evidence for or against any hypotheses, only that it's possible to reach the age of 14 billion and not how likely the age is.

- Another issue is that even if most timelines result in a reset, the resets can only go as far back as when the civilization can conceivably invent time travel. There is no reason for the timeline reset to go back to an earlier species (how can a human mind take over an alien mind?). Hence the timeline should be seen as a series of bursts of frequent resets with long stretches of uninterrupted timelines. This is true even if multiple species with time travel exist at the same time, as long none of them can interact with each other. Slowly over the corpses of numerous failed species, the timeline of the universe will gradually progress.
