Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

** Speaking of plotting meteorological data... I feel like the discussion around the arctic ice extent in the media is often around "oh this next big ice chunk broke off", but what's more interesting/worrying is the overall temperatures and ice extent. For example, [[https://icons-sf.wxug.com/hurricane/2016/arctic-temp-dec.png][the winter of 2016's temperatures for the arctic were at some points, a record +25C anomaly from the mean!]]. Equally interesting is the [[https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf/nsidc_global_area_byyear_b.png][sea surface ice extent, which is significantly down in 2016-2017.]] It's hard to understate the magnitude of the change in the ice extent. [[https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_stddev_timeseries.png][2016-2017 is now at greater than 2 standard deviations away]] from the mean ice extent, briefly flirting with a 4 standard deviations last November. Previous years had low ice extents, but 2016's is shockingly low, a massive departure from even 2015. The change is so massive that it seems the past trends will not even hold into the future, even after temperatures return to normal. The loss of ice extent will become permanent and will create a new normal climate for the arctic, a much warmer one. It seems plausible we may begin to see an ice-free arctic during the summer months by the next century.

I think the greater implications of this change are also understated in the media. I don't foresee the rise in sea levels as a major problem for most of the world. However, the arctic ice extent serves as a significant source of albedo for Earth, reflecting light away and cooling the planet. With this greatly diminished, polar regions will warm, and the increased moisture content in the air will increase the air pressure in polar regions slightly. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex#Climate_change][Increased air pressure will decrease the strength of the polar vortexes (vortexes are Low-pressure events), and weaker polar vortexes will be pulled away from the Northern latitudes and southwards.]] This is a vicious cycle, as the polar vortex moves away from the arctic, arctic temperatures warm further, displacing polar vortexes further, increasing arctic temperatures further, etc. This may also paradoxically result in Canadian and Siberian areas remaining colder than usual, despite the overall temperature increases, as weaker polar vortexes will move south into these regions.

#+begin_quote
  Thiel is quite a different figure from Bannon, but his ambivalence about democracy is even more explicit, shading over into outright contempt. A Silicon Valley libertarian who got rich by developing PayPal, Thiel historically likes his capitalism undiluted by sentimentality. He shares Bannon's disdain for complacent elites and their crony capitalism, and has been an attention-getting provocateur against establishment institutions such as his alma mater, Stanford University. (He has famously offered grants to talented students who forgo college.) He is interested in technology that overcomes familiar human limitations, including space colonization and medical research into immortality. This kind of technological utopianism has a long pedigree in Silicon Valley, and was already well established in the 1990s, when it got friendly treatment from buzzy venues like Wired.

  Thiel's recasting himself as Tech Trump was perhaps most striking because, just a few years ago, he had written off politics altogether. “I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible,” Thiel wrote in a 2009 Cato Institute essay. Instead, “the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms.” He proposed redirecting energy to private enterprises that could end-run both the right's “totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes” and the left's “unthinking demos that guides so-called ‘social democracy.'” He proposed cyberspace, outer space and the high seas as refuges for anti-political libertarians. In a follow-up essay, Thiel explained, “I believe that politics is way too intense. That's why I'm a libertarian. Politics gets people angry, destroys relationships and polarizes peoples' vision: the world is us versus them; good people versus the other. Politics is about interfering with other people's lives without their consent. That's probably why, in the past, libertarians have made little progress in the political sphere. Thus, I advocate focusing energy elsewhere, onto peaceful projects that some consider utopian.”

  Whatever Thiel's motive, there is no sign that it is a new enthusiasm for democracy. Thiel wrote in his 2009 essay that “the broader education of the body politic has become a fool's errand.” There is no evidence that he has changed his mind about that. Trump's campaign, as noted, confirms Thiel's dire 2009 description of politics as an us-versus-them, anger-stoking festival of irrationality. But rather than renounce politics, Trump is pushing it in a direction that Thiel seems to tolerate, even embrace: If you can't escape the democratic herd, then maybe you can manage it on its own irrational terms. If politics is essentially demagoguery, then what a libertarian needs is a skillful and congenial demagogue.

Here's the same article's take on Steve Bannon:

#+begin_quote
  To understand Bannon's outlook, the best source we have is a remote address he gave in 2014 to a conference of the Human Dignity Institute, a conservative political group with right-wing Catholic ties, which was being held at the Vatican. In the talk, recently published by BuzzFeed, Bannon laid out a strikingly coherent picture of his worldview, which has a few fundamental elements.

  First, the United States and Europe are at the beginning of “a very brutal and bloody conflict” against “a new barbarity that's starting, which will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years,” unless “we” defeat it. This is “jihadist Islamic fascism.” The “river of blood” that the Islamic State promises “is going to come to Western Europe, it's going to come to the United Kingdom.” (Bannon seems to be just the leading edge of this clash-of-civilizations theme in the Trump administration. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has called radical Islam an “existential threat” and suggested that Islam itself is “a cancer” of an ideology rather than a genuine religion.)

  Second, what “we” must defend against Islamic fascism is a very specific version of Western civilization. The lesson of World War II and the struggle against totalitarianism, Bannon explains, is that the great and singular achievement of the West is “an enlightened form of capitalism.” It is, he says, a specifically “Christian” or “Judeo-Christian” version of capitalism that produces wealth for the good of the community, in which “divine providence” empowers its favored people “to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth.” The thing to notice is what is left out. In a description of a coming battle for Western civilization and of the lessons of the 20th-century struggle against totalitarianism, Bannon does not mention democracy. He doesn't mention constitutionalism. Capitalism is the thing at stake in a global clash of civilizations, the most precious part of a legacy of freedom.

  What does it mean that Bannon doesn't talk about democracy or constitutionalism? Maybe he just forgot. But it seems more likely that his nationalist capitalism is an alternative theory of political legitimacy, and one whose emergence doesn't necessarily depend on the machinery of democracy. The role of politics in Bannon's view seems to be not to choose the direction of national and global economics, but to move them toward a destination already in Bannon's mind. When Bannon famously called himself a “Leninist,” he might have had this idea in mind: that the role of political action is to seize the state and move ruthlessly toward a predetermined goal, marshaling whatever forces will help you get there. Bannon gives no hint that the populist wave is a call for deepened democracy, which would mean, for instance, expanding political participation for working people and the marginalized (rather than embracing an anti-union agenda and vote-suppression laws) and reducing the political influence of the superwealthy class that produced Trump and is now beginning to fill his Cabinet and the ranks of his advisers.

Remember that bit of HPMOR where Harry decides to ignore the despair because he intellectually knows it's being caused by dementors and not by reality? This exact situation is what that was about. Optimism is absolutely warranted when you know for a fact that a film of unrealistic pessimism has been placed over your perceptions.

Second, you are predicting that the rest of time will be filled with fascism and war from just eight years of bad politics. Fascism didn't even last twelve years before getting obliterated last time, and even if our democratic institutions collapse under Trump (an eventuality with very low priors to begin with, considering those institutions have survived a civil war and institutionalized racism), it seems likely to me that the United States would crumble under its weight and be replaced by something else long before it reached the point of galactic hegemony.

Trump is going to be bad. He will be a disaster. But he is going to be a disaster contained to four years of time, or perhaps even less. He will smash into our fragile economic recovery like a train into a donut shop and the people who voted him in will be forced to realize exactly how wrong they were. Not all of them, perhaps not even most of them. But enough. The margins are thin. Trump simply cannot keep the promises he has made, and the flyover states which voted for him out of hope that something might be fixed for them will notice that nothing has improved for them. It's the economy, stupid. It's always the economy.

** This is a bit late, but still trying. A rational pokemon update, or a question rather. One of the questions currently being faced is how to design the modder facing side of body part stat weighting. To elaborate, every body a pokemon has is going to be linked to different stats in different amounts, taking out a leg might harm their Movement a lot more than their Strength for example, and attacking the eyes would harm their ability to see but not do too much to their HP.

The question is how to represent these, there are currently two major ideas.

--------------

The first, represent them as adjustments of batches. You would represent a weighting of having more HP than normal as HP+ for example, or HP- for less HP than normal.

For the hard numbers, say you have a batch size of 3. Then HP+ would represent two batches (6), HP++ would represent three batches (9), HP+++ four batches (12)and so on. HP- would represent one less than a batch (2), HP-- two less than a batch (1), HP--- three less than a full batch (0) and so on. Exact numbers would obviously vary with the batch size. So if for example you had two HP- and one HP+ the HP- would each get 20% of the HP attributed to those body parts and the HP+ would get 60% of the HP.

--------------

The second idea is to represent weighting via numbers. You would represent a weighting of having more HP than normal as a high such as HP:10 maybe, while a low number such as HP:2 would represent much less HP.

For the hard numbers, a HP:2 would represent two weight, a HP:10 would represent ten weight, a HP:1000 one thousand weight and so on. So if for example you had two HP:3 and one HP:6 the HP:3 would each get 25% of the HP and the HP6 would get 50% attributed to it.

--------------

The question is, which system do you think would work better? Why? What do you think of both? Is there something else you think might work better? Well, that's more than one question really.

And as always, come join in [[https://discord.gg/dJRsE6Z][the Discord]] if it sounds interesting, always up for discussion on it, although it's shifted a bit more towards implementation design than game design of late.

*** As another voice from the conversation, I would like to mention that for the 'both' system, you would have the +/- system map to certain numbers in the core numbers system, and you could use either version as you pleased. In this situation, you still retain edge-case functionality with the ability to use whichever number you please, while also having the most intuitive values you'd commonly use lined up in a simpler system for easier design when not in those edge cases. Conversion between the two could be effectively detailed with a tooltip in the design interface, and speaking as someone who was designing Pokemon before all of the systems were yet again thrown into flux, having a simpler list of options really makes the design process easier, even as I appreciate the benefit of edge cases like a Pokemon with fifty tentacles that all need their own amount of relevance too small to properly describe with pluses or minuses.

I don't remember if it was you or m.b. someone else, who in a similar thread once shared a facebook picture, with the context of how their fellow students (I think?) made a problem out of not-wanting-to-party-with-them, but this is almost the same type of communication problem (I'll try to post the comment I've mentioned here, if I find it).

I agree with your general message itself, regarding an individual's overhyped prestige in a peer group. However, the manner in which you've tried to decline such “prestige-shower” was extremely and unnecessarily rude.

*** You bred resentment far more effectively with the tone of your response to greek strategos.

Saying things like "any idiot could do it" is insulting, it implies that the person you helped was an idiot.

**** Yeah, that was the Hindenberg of PR attempts.

If you were actually concerned with being over-hyped (I do have that fear myself) an "Awww shucks" would have been far more effective than "Fuck you for over-hyping me (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"

Nobody would have come at you with pitchforks or sworn vengeance upon you for accepting that praise.

Out of interest, what were you aiming for by sharing this?

1. Are we meant to agree: "Yeah, fuck that guy for over-hyping you"?
2. Is it a smug: "Normals, amirite?"?
3. Are you exasperated that people can't solve their own problems?
4. Did you think that you had done a funny smack-down?
5. Is this some form of signalling?
6. Do you want a hug?
7. Why is reddit's formatting so terrible? I have to press enter twice in order to get a new line. Jesus Christ.

This is at least the /third/ time I've had to make a denial of expertise in matters relevant to that subforum (though the other two times were in private messages). It does get annoying.

Note also my signature in the screenshot, which specifically says =Politeness is the enemy of honesty.=.

How have you held an account on this site for literally two years without clicking the =formatting help= button at the lower right corner of the text input box and following [[http://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting][the =the commenting wiki page= link]]?

Maybe it isn't as good as HTML--but it certainly is better than plain text.

****** I actually made it 1.6 years without clicking those buttons.

How?

I don't speak much.

I was making a complaint about a specific markdown rule, not "HOW DO I FORMAT I'M NOT GOOD AT COMPUTERS".

Turns out that rule a trade-off to deal with editors that don't have softwrapping.

So Toka, I'd like to thank you for leading me to research this, and hereby assign you *100 Prestige*.

You don't have any spare prestige to be given out. The person who attempted to do so in the screenshot, on the other hand, has the signature =Proud member of MEIOU & Taxes=, which is among the /most prestigious/ mods for /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4][Europa Universalis IV]]/.
