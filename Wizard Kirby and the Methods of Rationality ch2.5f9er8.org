The plot bunny came back, so I decided to continue this after all. Enjoy!

POYOPOYOPOYOPOYOPOYOPOYOPOYOPOYO

The silver light started to recede. Kirby followed it as quickly as he could as the invisible monsters chased him from behind. He did not want to get caught by them.

ZZZZZZZZZ

The old wizard strode back into the midst of the Aurors, the silver and the red-golden phoenixes now following behind.

"/You/ -" Amelia began to bellow.

"They have dismissed their Patronus," said Dumbledore. The old wizard didn't seem to raise his voice but his calm words somehow overrode her own. "I cannot find them now."

Amelia gritted her teeth, and put a number of scathing remarks on hold, and turned to the communications officer. "Tell the duty room to ask the Dementors /again/ if they can sense Bellatrix Black."

The communications specialist spoke to her mirror for a moment, and a few seconds later, looked up, surprised. "No -"

Amelia was already cursing violently in her mind.

"- but they can see someone else on the lower levels who isn't a prisoner. Two someones, in fact."

"Fine!" snapped Amelia. "Tell the Dementor that a dozen of its kind are authorized to enter Azkaban and seize whoever those two are and anyone in their company! And if they see Bellatrix Black, they're to Kiss her immediately!"

Amelia turned and glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring him to argue; but the old wizard only looked at her a bit sadly, and held his peace.

--------------

Auror McCusker finished speaking to the corpse that drifted outside the window, conveying the Director's orders.

The corpse gave him a deathly smile that almost unstrung his limbs, and then floated downward.

Soon after, a dozen Dementors arose from where they had drifted in the central pit of Azkaban, and headed outward, toward the walls of the vast metal structure that towered above them.

Entering through holes set into the base of Azkaban, the darkest of all creatures began their march of horror.

--------------

Kirby was tired of running from the invisible monsters. There were too many of them to suck up, and he didn't want to try that again after what happened the last time. He wasn't going to make it...

He remembered when he had confronted King Deedeedee at the Fountain of Dreams, only to discover an awful truth. Kirby had slaughtered innocents believing them to be in the way of saving the world. But in so doing he was only bringing the world closer to ruin. He had only barely defeated Nightmare in time before it destroyed the Planet Popstar, and Nightmare had taken a chunk of the sun with him as it died. The denizens of Popstar had to evacuate and Kirby had needed to collect a TON of asteroids and other debris as fast as possible to make up for the loss of gravitational force on Popstar. That had taken a very long time, even with extremely powerful machines and copy abilities at his disposal.

He remembered the first time he had fought against Dark Matter, an alien race of eldritch abominations which fed on negative emotions like fear, pain and despair. He barely survived that horror.

And he remembered fighting against Star Dream. His attack deflected, ripping a hole in the space time continuum. Falling down, down, down, knowing that his entire home universe was doomed.

The invisible monsters' cold, clammy hands grabbed Kirby and carried him away, screaming.
