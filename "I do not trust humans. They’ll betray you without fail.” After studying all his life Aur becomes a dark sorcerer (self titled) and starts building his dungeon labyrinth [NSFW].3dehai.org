** i found the MC and the writing fairly interesting all in all, but i can't help feeling like at least with how much has been released this is more of an hentai manga with a story, then a story manga with some hentai in it.

meaning so far everything feels like its written so the MC will have as many opportunities to have different kinds of sex, rather then the sex being there to progress anything..

It is still early though, so its possible it will go in a direction where it will become more story focused later. On the other hand it might just as well keep this pattern of sex every chapter, but that would mean that more and more time will need to be spent preparing the setting to generate different sex scenes, so it will just devolve into plain hentai.

*** I can understand the Succubus. She's a being who is clearly not human and has non-human values and utility functions. I feel the Hero broke way, /way/ too quickly.

The 'random villager girl offered power' seems perfectly logical however. She's been powerless all her life, and now she's been healed and offered things beyond her wildest dreams. Of course she's going to cling to the source.

The 10 year old is a 10 year old.

So really, the only main character issue is with the hero.

** Interesting story of a rational villain and a good reason for heroes, monsters and the dungeon itself. However, for anyone who hasn't read it yet the NSFW is there because the main character is a straight up evil sorcerer who, as a human, happens to enjoy sex.

In other words, explicit sex scenes including rape (hesitate to describe it as mild as he hypnotises her so it isn't violent but still morally reprehensible) and nudity as well as a bit of gore.

As a side note, despite him being a villain, evil and a rapist he's still the best harem manga protagonist I've seen so far. This says so much more about harem mangas than this one in particular though.

**** No tension because Aur is an over planner. He plans and manipulates like a stage magician, all the 70 years of effort is "off stage" so the readers only join and start seeing the payoff

What I find fun are his explanations of how he manipulates or planned out of sight to achieve the no tension best results.

***** I do dislike how everything is overtly explained though, I'm more interested in the how rather than the why. Overlord, another anime about an evil MC, does this far better. It manages to keep both worldbuilding and plotbuilding together, without neglecting one.

*** I do feel that the Manga falls into the trope of having the MC be so much smarter than everyone else, it becomes a cake walk. Furthermore, he says he's evil, but doesn't really do much evil stuff. I feel like the author just said that to appeal to the targeted demographic.

***** Well it depends on your definition of evil, but its not like he just kills people for the sake of it. He has a purpose and he does what he thinks is the most effective thing to achieve it.

He just seems selfish, not particularly good aligned, nor evil.

I doubt he is worse(probably better) then medieval rulers.

******* Personally i wouldnt call that evil, just selfish.

But anyhow even that could be argued. For exmaple even though there are innocent in that first village, the war that would happen if he is thought of as weak would cost far more innocents. So its actually killing a few innocent people now so you don't need to kill many more later.

You could claim that he is evil for going to them in the first place, but it is specifically shown that his effects(making their fields prosper so no one dies of hunger, protect them from bandits, etc.) Are significantly beneficial and i think they far outweigh the cost(some food, and a single maiden every year). I mean they dont give numbers, but pretty sure they get more food from his help then he is taking. And statistically the bandits take more then one girl per year, seeing as an entire village was emptied of multiple girls in one such attack

So then while he is not benevolent he is giving them a net plus in effect, is he still evil? He doesnt give them a choice, but neither does your goverment.. Your goverment also takes taxes from you in exchange for some services(far less then he is taking to be honest), are goverments evil?

***** Yes, but he hasn't done anything /personal/. All those who have died are redshirts, so the emotional impact is zero.

Furthermore, he convinced the Swordswoman to follow him rather than simply mind rape her into submission. Far safer, and his statements that he wishes for a competent underling falls flat when he can simply summon demons/entice existing busty monsters.

****** Well the universe seems to run on trope logic and he specifically stated that mind raping her or trying to kill her has a high chance of backfiring at a critical moment. The option he was left with was causing a "bright heroic maiden" to become a "fallen hero" by way of rape and hypnotism.

He's a neutral evil character who doesn't gain any substantial enjoyment from murder but that's not an excuse

****** He convinced her /through/ rape and manipulation. Well that, and some sort of magical pleasure induction thing. I'm pretty sure that falls on the evil side of the spectrum. In any sort of realistic universe she would hate his guts right about now.

What I think you mean is that he's not being pointlessly evil, rather every evil thing he does has a purpose. Not a sadist that hurts people for no reason, but certainly one who would napalm a family if they refused to bow down to him.

******* the impression i get is less about him killing the family because they refused to bow down, but more that he would kill them because them refusing to bow down and living would mean others might get funny ideas like mutiny which would require killing far more of them or dying. so if he is in a situation where he makes a demand and isn't denied in a reasonable manner he will kill to make an example etc. but otherwise he would be fair.

to demonstrate the point, in the last chapter when he got offered a little kid as a sacrifice he didn't go and burn down the village. and when he took the burnt girl he didn't just take her, or even take her and say that this would could for the next year offering as well. instead he said that because he took one early they wont need to make another offering for 10 years, which is more then reasonable once you are within that frame of reference.
