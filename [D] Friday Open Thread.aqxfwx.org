Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Due to overflowing disappointment in my own ineptitude and my burning envy towards all the math-savvy people in the rationalsphere, I've been self-studying mathematics from scratch.

My daily routine looks like this:

- I go through a chapter in a textbook, carefully reading all the definitions and trying to connect them to what I remember from school

- I try doing all the examples myself, before seeing the explanation

- at the end of the chapter, I solve at least 5--10 exercises

- in my spare time, I look up the same material on youtube/math stack exchange/reddit, seeking intuition and understanding

- every ~10 chapters (usually taking advantage of general sections in a textbook, e.g. ‘Quadratics' or ‘Right Angle Trigonometry'), I enter a card into Anki with a ‘Do x exercises from every chapter within section y' instruction towards my future self.

- I look up Anki every day, and do whatever it instructs me to do. After doing all the ‘review exercises', I click on ‘Good'.

- similarly, I enter hard-to-memorize formulas and theorems into it.

The textbooks I'm currently using:

- Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace (100% done)

- Elementary College Geometry by Henry Africk (~80% done)

- Trigonometry by Michael Corral

- Precalculus by Carl Stitz and Jeff Zeager

(...and I'm still lazily researching textbooks for calculus, linear algebra, and further maths.)

Are there any large flaws in my methods? Similarly, are there any things I could be doing that would boost the effectiveness of my learning? I'm mostly focused on maintaining my knowledge over large periods of time---this is my primary intention with using Spaced Repetition, but Anki is clearly not designed for subjects like math and I can do only so much with it. One of my biggest fears is spending time and effort learning something only to forget it, so if you have any suggestions in this area, I would be grateful.

*** First of all, it seems you are doing great! Very impressive!

In my experience, both learning mathematics and trying to help others learn, the most important part is practice, and you already do a lot of that.

Another thing that really helps is explaining things to others. I think the biggest danger is having the feeling of understanding something, while not actually having grasped all of it. While certain kinds of knowledge, like how to calculate the area of a polygon, can be tested easily by doing exercises, others, such as “why do the angle bisectors of a regular polygon meet at a single point” are more difficult. The further you go in mathematics, the more the latter is going to matter. Being able to explain things seems to be a pretty good indicator of understanding.

Obviously, finding people to explain things to might be difficult. However, talking to yourself can be a fine alternative, depending on your skill to be self-critical. Another possibility is writing things down as though someone else might read it. Just having the mindset is important.

Looking at your textbooks, it seems to me you are currently focussing on fundamental techniques and less on proofs. Exercises containing the word "prove" are really quite different from ones that do not. So, I would recommend trying to figure out what interests you and then try to move into that direction in the long run. While proofs and logic are certainly at the heart of mathematics, they might be less important if you are looking for certain applications.

Personally, I really like logical thinking, proving things and programming things, and these are basically the same activity for me. When I am trying to understand something, I always try to poke holes in the arguments (“Why do we need this line?”, “Does it still work if X is not Y? Where does it fail?”) and start by attempting to do it on my own. Also, I am not afraid of forgetting, because logic is something I apply all the time when thinking about whether things are true or whether an argument makes sense.

I would not worry about forgetting facts. Things that are useful will be used and thus not be forgotten and the things you had understood at some point still helped you to get better at understanding things.

Final point: Take care to be challenged. Solving difficult problems is a much more efficient way to improve then easy ones.

In that sense, I leave you (and anyone else reading this) with a “simple” puzzle I have just been working on: [[https://imgur.com/KPptBZM][Image]] Can you fill the squares of the number pyramid with whole numbers, so that each square is the sum of the two below it? (No negative numbers.)

I felt like I should have used a diophantine equation towards the end, but I couldn't remember how to do them, so I sorta brute forced the last few steps.

***** I got the exact same answer as you did. I basically brute forced it sorta since the entire pyramid is completely determined by the bottom row.

The entire comment that follows is all about how to solve the problem through intelligent brute-forcing without any knowledge of advanced math!

First I made a smaller pyramid with only 17 at the top and 7 at the bottom right corner of a row with only 4 numbers. First I tested to see how fast the top number would grow if the bottom layer goes from <1, 1, 1, 7> to <2, 2, 2, 7> so I could estimate what triple would reach 17. Funnily enough, <1, 1, 1, 7> gave 14 while <2, 2, 2, 7> gave 21 which mean the real answer was in between the two. <1, 2, 1, 7> and <1, 1, 2, 7> both worked to generate 17 as the top number. So I then moved on to the second pyramid to test while (for now) assuming the first row to be <1, 1, 2, 7>

The second pyramid I made was simply a pyramid with 45 at the top, 6 at the bottom left corner, and whatever numbers <1, 1, 2> generates by being at the bottom right corner.

<45>

<?, ?>

<?, ?, 5>\\
<?, ?, 2, 3>\\
<6, ?, 1, 1, 2>\\
Since the number 45 was a lot higher than 17 and there was only one more row compared to the pyramid above, I knew that the number next to 6 had to be a lot higher than 1, so I decided to test by filling it in as 6 and if the top number was higher or lower than 45, I would try again with 5 or 7. <6, 6, 1, 1, 2> generated 42 and <6, 7, 1, 1, 2> generated 46.\\
Since getting 45 as the top number was clearly impossible, I knew that the answer for the first pyramid then had to be <1, 2, 1, 7>, and that the bottom row had to be <6, 7, 1, 2, 1> which resulted in 45.\\
By combining the two pyramid's bottom rows, the final answer was <6, 7, 1, 2, 1, 7> which generates 78!

****** Yeah I, too, divided it into 2 pyramids. I formulated an equation each for the 2 pyramids, assuming the big pyramid's bottom looks like this:

<6, x1, x2, x3, x4, 7>

Inner pyramids' equations:

45 = 1 * 6 + 4 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 4 * x3 + 1 * x4

17 = 1 * x2 + 3 * x3 + 3 * x4 + 7

(Combinatoric details: these coefficients come from the amount of paths a number can take to reach the top of their respective pyramid, and is calculated by C(layers to climb, left steps required), so for the leftmost object up to 45 it'd be C(4, 0), which is 1 because there is only 1 path that the 6 can take to reach 45: Right, right, right, right. This reasoning might seem far-fetched but it's very close to the reasoning used when relating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle][pascal's triangle]] to combinatorics, which is why I came up with it.)

After that it got really hard for me to continue the calculation purely formally for me though, as it's very hard to inject the info "The answer has to be a non-negative integer" into a normal equation, something a diophantine equation can do (I think, I never properly learned them. Especially not working with more than 2 variables in them).

So I personally explored the small pyramid's equation with this information in mind myself and managed to narrow it down to

<x2, x3, x4, 7>

where x2 = 10 - 3*(x3 + x4) and x3 + x4 <= 3 and x2, x3, x4 >= 0

Then came the brute force method, where I inserted a few of the possible small pyramids into the large pyramid's equation until one stuck, and there I had my answer.

Generally our solutions are quite close. I feel that my knowledge of combinatorics would've been more helpful if you scaled the exercise by a few levels, but it did help me quickly assess the relation between numbers in different levels.

******* It is so interesting to see your solutions :) I am kind of surprised how well educated guessing work. My own also gets to these equations

#+begin_quote
  45 = 1 * 6 + 4 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 4 * x3 + 1 * x4

  17 = 1 * x2 + 3 * x3 + 3 * x4 + 7
#+end_quote

Which we can simplify to

4 * x1 + 6 * x2 + 4 * x3 + 1 * x4 = 39

0 * x1 + 1 * x2 + 3 * x3 + 3 * x4 = 10

Dropping the variables gives

#+begin_example
  x1 x2 x3 x4
   4  6  4  1 | 39
   0  1  3  3 | 10
#+end_example

4 and 6 are even while 39 is not, so we have to use x4 at least once. So lets subtract that.

#+begin_example
       x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  1 | 38
        0  1  3  3 |  7
       ------------+
  used  0  0  0  1
#+end_example

7 cannot be divided by 3, so we have to take x2 at least once as well.

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  1 | 32
        0  1  3  3 |  6
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  1
#+end_example

If we were to use x4 once more, then 32-1 = 31 is odd again, so we would have to use x4 at least twice. It would look like this:

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  1 | 30
        0  1  3  3 |  0
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  3
#+end_example

Now the second row is zero, so we cannot use x2, x3 and x4 anymore. 30 is not divisible by 4, so this does not work, and we cannot use x4. Going back:

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  6  4  - | 32
        0  1  3  - |  6
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  1
#+end_example

We have to use x2 an even number of times, else the first row is not divisible by 4. It also has to be divisible by 3, else the second row does not work. But if we use it 6 times (the smallest even number divisible by 3), then the first row becomes negative. So no x2 as well.

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  -  4  - | 32
        0  -  3  - |  6
       ------------+
  used  0  1  0  1
#+end_example

Finally, we use x3 two and x1 six times.

#+begin_example
        x1 x2 x3 x4
        4  -  4  - |  0
        0  -  3  - |  0
       ------------+
  used  6  1  2  1
#+end_example

I will admit that educated guessing is much easier. But this instance was computer-generated, so it is nice that I can tell a story at all. (Incidentally, the puzzle was created by applying this basically in reverse.)

******** To be more detailed about my guessing, I stuck the equations into a matrix as well but I didn't quite know how to algorithmically solve it like you did. I did however end up with this form:

#+begin_example
  x1 x2 x3 x4
  -4  0  14  17 |  21
#+end_example

Since I then knew that the sum of x3 and x4 is 3 or less, and that 14x3 + 17x4 = 21 + 4x1, I simply wrote a table of 21 + 4x1, like

21

25

29

...

45

and all I had to do was test 14x3 + 17x4 against my newly made table for a maximum of 5 times to find the answer.

I do think that these kinds of solutions are pretty unclean though. The elegancy of math is lost when you start guessing your way forward. It's like solving an algebraic exercise with a graphing calculator. You might get the answer, but your dignity takes some damage.

Your method seems pretty solid as long as you can stick to it, if you can't keep with that I'd look at online lessons that offer problems online. Aside from that I enjoy Khan academy lessons for previews and reviews, but they move too fast for me to learn math from.

I would also suggest throwing in a statistics book when you want a break, I found algebra based statistics very interesting and not mathematically challenging in the same way.

** So I've been playing Destiny 2 recently. Quite a lot, in fact - I basically played it for like a week straight at first, and have now settled down into only occasional 5+ hour stints now that I've hit endgame.

Something that I've noticed is that the lore is very, very bad. I don't know why so many people like it. It's almost entirely dependent on rule-of-cool handwavium, poorly explained in very badly written lore snippets you have to hunt down from secrets. It has neat /ideas/, but basically doesn't do anything with it.

The main characters are Guardians, who are given space magic and lichdom from a giant world-travelling acasual entity called the Traveller; they can do weird effects and are raised from the dead as long as their Ghost (small machine thing) exists. They basically just do fuck all for the past several thousand years out of kinda-religious feelings of not wanting to be proactive, allowing humanity to backslide out of a "Golden Age" until the entire solar system is overrun by aliens and humans only have a single city left. The Fallen are galaxy-wide scavaging pirates who are commonly portrayed as dumb as bricks, and mysteriously have left any machine you'd need working just fine despite their scavanging. The Hive as death worshipping omnicidal wizard aliens trying to summon elder gods, and are actually pretty cool except for all their out-of-context magic never actually do anything. The Vex managed to convert an entire planetoid to Computanium to simulate timelines and have a portal nexus spanning an infinite web of parallel realities but don't do anything and basically fall over to a breeze. The Awoken were members on a colonyship expedition, ran into a fight between the Light and Dark acasual entities and were trapped in a timewarped singularity universe where they were postscarcity and immortal, and then the queen reincarnated everyone to a mortal body because they needed to "evolve and live meaningful lives" and because we didn't have enough pro-death JRPG tropes in video games, I guess.

The entire thing just feels terrible. Even the actual storylines are bad - the entire first arc is diaspora analog that basically amounts to Deus ex machina trust your god bullshit, the first expansion is fighting against post-singularity infinite computation power timeline simulating Vex and winning because the Vex can't simulate Handwavium, the second is waffling AI security that could have been interesting if it felt like there were any stakes and you didn't already activate a Golden Age AI in the first arc, or the AI actually had any character, and the third is a drawn out revenge story after one of your friends is perma-killed that fails to actually hit any of the "are we the baddies" note it was trying to hit, and then switches into a completely unexplained arc with the Awoken that ends with a "ah, I wanted you to kill me! All according to kaikaku" and conscious-of-but-cant-change-events timeloop.

I'm not even upset about the story. It's just so /disappointing/. If I played Destiny 1 maybe it would make more sense, or if I spent the time reading into the scarce worldbuilding they drip to people so they feel invested like Overwatch and other properties do.

I'm, uh, not entirely sure where I'm going with this. I'm still gonna play it. Just wanted to rant.

Star Wars focuses /far/ more on Jedi and Sith than on Sienar and Incom. Thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, X-wings and (basic) TIE fighters are still being used with only minor modifications (both in the EU and in Disney's canon, IIRC).

I've enjoyed the first 10 chapters of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21353/esper-search-for-power][Esper: Search for Power]], but can't wholly recommend it. It's a rational-adjacent take on litrpg, played very straight / cliche. Hopefully the writer continues writing and improves. The pacing is not great, it gets too caught up in the details of the character's thoughts and, so far, everything has felt too easy for the protagonist. I fear the story has left itself too little room to move forward in terms of escalating challenges. There's some acknowledgement of most of that --- both in-story and in the Author's comments --- but it's on Hiatus after 25 chapters, and within a couple months of starting.

I enjoyed reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10286/the-good-student][The Good Student]], but it switched to another site which was too bloated with tracking and ads for me to load it on my old phone. I have a better phone and a better adblocker and plan to return to reading it eventually.

***** Superoptimizers bruteforce assembly in order to find the most optimal snippet. There's also hyperparameter optimization in machine learning, which bruteforces hyperparameters from a phase space.

In general, it's bruteforcing Turing machines. You're not going to get anything efficient, although it'll be stupidly parallel.

***** There's been a Monte Carlo version: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0801]]

They used it to play Pac-Man, among other things: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfsMHtmGDKE]]

** Anyone have any advice or some kind of guide to choosing a career? Or how to find a passion of some kind? I recently graduated college with a biology degree, as a medical school to be failure, and I have no idea what to do with my life.

*** Take the O*Net interest profiler and answer it honestly. I've been in a room with 20 people all taking it at the same time, get wildly divergent results, and seen each person say "Well obviously I got recommended a dream job, sucks for the rest of the room though."

The questions seem dumb, but they also show a lot of low preparation (e.g. low/no college alternatives) versions of jobs you want.

*** Cal Newport's book /So Good They Can't Ignore You/ addresses this topic. As an alternative to reading all 300 pages, [[https://commoncog.com/blog/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/][this 3,500-word summary]] does a good job of covering the most important points from the book.

*** 80000 hours has a huge section on that. Of course its focussed around "impactful" carreers, but still some other stuff might be helpful.

There is also the question for what you are trying to optimize for. Money/job security/happiness/freedom etc.
