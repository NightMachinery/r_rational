*** I think it was hinted before he has this compulsion to be overly precise, and just can't help himself. It just makes it even more funny, in my opinion

  I turned without needing to be hailed, and discomfort flickered across her face.

  I clapped his shoulder, and even being careful nearly sent him tumbling to the ground.

It's the little things like these that make this story for me. Casual lines that have no plot relevance but their absence would make the reading so much less interesting and the setting so much less defined. I should be taking notes, really.
