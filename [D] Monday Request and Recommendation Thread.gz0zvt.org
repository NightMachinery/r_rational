Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** It's been recommended a couple times in past threads. Nowhere Land is a jumpchain/horror fic set (initially) in the Pokemon universe.

I have to counter-rec it. The main character has no personality, even accounting for the genre, and the mystery is the kind that insists upon itself, reminding you every few scenes and taking you out of the story, with zero subtlety and much repetitiveness. It's only missing ambiguous text in italics at the beginning of chapters.

Characters in general are pretty one-dimensional and weak, and everyone is reactive. The story isn't really scary either. Honestly, I can't understand what people see in this story. The conceit of the Pokemon jump was pretty original, I guess? It /could/ get more interesting in the far future?

*** Tough, but fair. Respect for the feedback.

One question, if that's all right. "It's only missing ambiguous text in italics at the beginning of chapters" strikes me as possibly sarcastic, given that later chapters do have italic text at the beginning of chapters. Is that so? Those bits are meant to have a straightforward connection to the chapter they're in, but if they're coming off as so much woo, then that's actionable, and I can work on adjusting them. (If you bailed out before reaching the italic bits, which is the other possibility that occurs to me, that's fair too.)

Your other concerns, I'll admit, are not things I want to be true of my story. But, well, if they are then they are. Things to work on going forward, and also maybe while looking to revise.

**** Ah, no, that's not what I mean by ambiguous text in italics. A lot of pretentious mystery fics have stuff like

#+begin_quote
  /Beneath the moonlight glints a tiny fragment of silver, a fraction of a line.../
#+end_quote

at the beginning of chapters, which are meant to hint at the main mystery, but aren't meant to be solvable. Of course, the example I used (from HPMOR) is acceptable because it happens once in the entire fic.

The book excerpts are one of the best parts of the second jump, though maybe there are too many. Really, if you want to focus on actionable feedback, the single most important thing in my humble opinion is "fixing" the main character, but I'm not sure if that can be done without a rewrite. Thank you for reading my feedback and good luck with the story.

*** I guess we just receive it much differently. I like the main character a lot; he's not overbearing but I can't really understand what you mean by 'no personality'. He's distinctly a different person from the side characters in the story, both in the Pokemon and the Madoka universes. I guess the secondary characters are a bit one-dimensional, but that's excusable in short fiction; they have time to grow or be explored more deeply later too.

**** I'm not saying everyone is written the same way, but I have trouble understanding what motivations the protagonist has besides generic heroism, or his likes and dislikes. The whole "you can't stand out" thing is dropped pretty fast.

He's different from the side characters mostly because he's so bland, in contrast to the side characters being exaggerations of single traits - the shy girl in the Pokemon jump in particular is a walking cliche.

Out of curiosity, how would you say Rien stands apart from other jumpchain protagonists?

Other than the obvious problem of physical intimacy it might address eating together or wanting to share hobbies. Things we take for granted because of a shared morphology that the couple can't take for granted.

** Hey guys! Haven't posted here much before and wanted to ask for some advice. I started reading Pokemon: Origin of Species a couple of days ago, and I'm currently undecided in whether I want to continue it or try something else. I absolutely loved it in the beginning - the worldbuilding and characters where really cool. However, I am now just past Mt. Moon and there are two things that's bothering me a lot.

First, the pace. It feels absolutely glacial. Is this going to continue throughout, or does it pick up at some point?

Secondly, and perhaps more worrying: Reds lack of strong pokemon and his attitude towards it. I get that he's not Blue, and I'm not asking him to be, but I find his disinterest in catching and training new pokemon and his attitude towards the competitive aspects kind of.. irrational? He's been in two extremely dangerous situations so far, and clearly understands the value of having strong pokemon and being able to help and protect, and still, most of his time is spent contemplating imponderables. I don't mind him questioning stuff, so I don't think my issue is with ratfic as such, I'm just concerned that he finds questioning his friends biases more important than potentially life saving training, if you understand? Is this just me? If he was just sitting in Oaks lab doing his research, I'd understand, but as far as I can tell his initial motivation for becoming a trainer was also his general interest in pokemon and travelling. At this point, he seems to be just tagging along, losing pokemon and almost dying left and right, without considering his own weakness as a trainer an issue for a second. Is he going to pick up his game at some point, or is his character going to develop even more to the extreme of "I am more worried about my potental future research career than in surviving the next two days"?

I would be very interesting in continuing the series if Red picks up his game and the pace improves, but if not: Are there any other rational-ish pokemon series that you think would suit me better based on my current issues?

*** He moves further away from catching & training.

He leaves the group to dedicate himself full-time to psychic research. This addresses your irrationality concern, in that he's no longer putting his life into his pokemon's hands on a daily basis, but will perhaps be less enjoyable for you nonetheless.

 

The other popular pokemon fanfics in these parts, which I believe both provided inspiration for Origin of Species, are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13407176/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]] (sadly aborted, with the final chapters posted as author notes) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line][Pokémon: The Line]] (probably also dead).

Both do the "pokemons are dangerous wild animals and the pokemon world is a terrifying place to send children into" thing, and they both have a protagonist much more like Blue than like Red/Green/Aiko.

*** I'd say put it on pause. The author doesn't seem to want to tell an interesting story but actually follow the lives of 3 somewhat interesting people in a very slow methodical pace. It's fine for what it is, and bearable when you are bulk reading it, but when you catch up and updates are monthly with most of them being interludes and non plot driving things it feels almost like it's trying to make you drop it.

​

Most months I completely forget about it, only for me to be reminded of it in a post or email. Which just turns into a boring task I need to get over with.

​

Nothing against Daystar, I like him, but he doesn't seem to get you either have to do high tension or relevance scenes or overviews of actions characters took over a long period of time. Instead he does no tension, glacial pacing follow along while the characters do boring work for 5k words which he could have done with the same effect in 2 lines during a relevant scene as a "thanks to my practice with X I was able to overcome Y" type of thing without wasting our time.

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like horror/psychologial stories. It's more of a slow-burn psychological thriller than the usual fantasy/scifi that I'm into, but it's well written with solid characters. Monthly updates unfortunately, but the chapters are solid.

A group of nun are essentially stuck in a convent. They haven't had contact with the outside world in quite some time. We know that something terrible has happened to the outside world, and it's coming for them now. They're all normal people, no special abilities, and they're just trying to keep their world going one day at a time.

With the 12th chapter that just came out (release rate is 1/month), the story hit its 1 year anniversary, and the plot has progressed substantially, so it's a good time to binge it.

Here's an excerpt (not a spoiler) from the beginning of the story that I really liked and shows off what kind of story it is.

It's an interlude, and spoils very little of the setting, the plot, or the main characters, but still shows off Wildbow's skill at writing relationships, problem solving, and action. Content warnings for horror and body horror; I don't suggest reading this during, or shortly before eating.

Keep in mind that this is the most intense the story has been so far, most of the other chapters were focussed on setting the scene, introducing important characters and mechanics, and showing each main characters' personal struggles.

All 3 of the the viewpoint characters are incredibly compelling and their pitfalls seem like the kind that would be relatable to people of the sub (eg. being overly enthusiastic while learning about/experimenting with magic). Not sure about using the interlude to get a taste of the story since it seems to be the climax of the first arc and it's really improved by all the suspense leading up to it but it not exactly wrong to say that it works pretty well standalone as well.

Also despite Pale having only started a month ago, there's already a fan audiobook that's within 1-2 chapters of being caught up as well as companion podcast by the Deep in Pact people

It takes place in a vaguely crapsack dystopian future with clones and bio-printers - then weird eldritch stuff starts happening with cult-like shibboleths and (a hint of, so far) anti-memetics. The main character at least tries to be rational, exploring the limits and requirements of the weird situation she finds herself in. One thing I like about the story is that she's also not hesitant to recruit help from the other folks in town who seem trustworthy.

MDA is an on-going continuation to the universe from the completed [[http://bloodismine.com/][Blood is Mine]], which is also good so far but I haven't finished it yet. That one is less about exploration and more survival horror.

I've found /Release That Witch/ to be of a much better quality, on average, than the WoP series --- and they are thematically quite similar otherwise. Both stories had their failures, but RTW still ended up much further ahead of WoP.

- RTW > WoP: Much more detailed and realistic descriptions of various technological processes. The authour [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork][has shown their work,]] the reader can actually learn a few things by just reading the descriptions if they are not skipping ahead to the "fun parts". WoP, in contrast, largely relies on DnD-style RPG mechanics to handwave away many engineering-, infrastructure-, and logistics-based problems that the protag would otherwise have to face and solve. For that matter, prot is often immune to adverse effects of military strategy and (opponents') psychology too.

  - However, the later parts of RTW are less detailed than the starting arcs. So if you find yourself thinking that you're not enjoying the story as much as before, or that it has started feeling like a generic isekai, it will probably not get any better in future chapters, and you can just start skipping through the filler paragraphs.
  - RTW-CON: it has too much anime logic, but not to a degree that would spoil the enjoyable parts.
  - RTW-CON: Like many other Isekai protagonists who come to another world from their day and age, they take their culture baggage as a list of self-evident truths, and the universe of the hosting new world never (or almost never) proves them and their opinions wrong.
  - WoP < any story of average quality: The final 1--2 books jump the shark spectacularly. [[#s][spoiler1]] Protag's personal power curve exponentially skyrockets out of nowhere, he gets unjustified rewards and aid, deus ex machina solutions are introduced to accommodate him. I suggest treating [[#s][spoiler2]] the summoning of his wife as the book series' finale and not bother reading anything after that.

- There's also the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40670][1632 series,]] although I haven't read it myself yet.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/WithThisRing][/With This Ring/]] does quite a bit of magic-assisted uplifting. More like munchkining through the entire DC franchise, really.

**** Adding on to what you said:

- Castle Kingside has been pretty good so far about the hurdles in introducing new technology in a medieval society. It has better prose than you normally see in webfiction, and the characters have been good so far as well. It's like what World of Prime could have been.

- Enlightened Empire is also a long civilization building story. It's currently on hiatus, and it's not as good as Castle Kingside. But it scratches that itch without jumping the shark too much.

- I'm currently reading a multicross called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-thread-iv.310606/][Cruel to be Kind]] that has a single stranded character building a civilization. It's been pretty good so far, although it's probably dead. There's a lot of content though.

**** Kind of late in the week to be adding to this, but the writing and characterization in WoP are really good, which I think has to be a factor in any comparison. I did kind of enjoy the somewhat ridiculous denouement, but it is pretty over the top. I'd also say that WoP is more focused on ethical issues and its interpretation of the alignment system, it's an uplift story but that's not the primary focus of the action. If thought of as pure uplift it's going to be a mild disappointment.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation][Heart of Cultivation]] is a xianxia by the author of "A Young Woman's Political Record" that seems promising so far. For a change the main character is not already stronger / more talented than his peers. On the contrary, he's an ex-child prodigy who's hit an insurmountable (so far :P) problem, and has fallen significantly behind. In a culture that primarily values strength and potential, that's not an enviable position.

**** It's a bit understated but there's some neat stuff going on.

Like I'm pretty sure the reason why it's called "Heart of Cultivation" is because the main character has realized that his insurmountable problem is due to a physical deficiency in his heart, which prevents him from advancing his cultivation. It starts /in media res/ with the MC working as an artificer, with that realization having happened in his backstory.

So his plan is very rational and logical. He's going to replace his own heart with an artificial construct so that he can continue cultivating. In the current Patreon chapters he's just managed to gather a critical component for his plan.

Overall it's a much more sane and rational Xianxia than most, but it's also very much a more traditional Xianxia than Cradle.

***** The author said he's trying to avoid what he sees as xianxia pitfalls, but it's way too early to say whether the story is rational or even interesting. I enjoy YWPR so I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.

It's hard to call his plan rational and logical without more in-world medical context, because for a "sane" person, it's batshit crazy and irrational to decide to get a heart transplant in pseudo-archaic xianxia society with an artificial heart that he made as an amateur - all in order to have the infinitesimal chance to cultivate and then consummate the farce of a duel to settle an arranged marriage. That's a pretty convoluted chain of logic to risk his life for, but xianxia period mores I guess? Also the perennial munchkin question: why hasn't anyone else done it already?

****** The stuff you bring up is addressed in the Patreon chapters, at least: he's done some research on the topic, which actually seems to have informed his choice of non-combat specialization; he's also been practicing with a poison that stops his heart for the last few years, since he knows he'll probably have to operate on himself. It's been done before, but generally as a prosthetic for cultivators who've lost their hearts for whatever reason. It's rare because it doesn't actually provide any benefits to someone who can cultivate - and people who /can't/ cultivate generally aren't worth the resources. This, combined with the fact that it's /exactly as dangerous as you might expect/, are why he hasn't brought this idea up with his parents; he's convinced that his family will not allow him to do it.

That being said his plan is "rational" in a very Degurechaff-esque fashion. Exceptionally high risk, exceptionally high reward, with mitigating factors due to proper preparation; and everything is done calmly and methodically, so it's easy to forget that he's preparing to perform open-heart surgery on himself.

** has anyone read "Mud's Mission" by ushnor on royalroadl? just started it but it seems like a decent General AI story/ paperclip meme in a lit-rpg universe:

for instance it references third law of robotics (but calls it golemancy in chapter 2) and the fourth chapter prelude is

"When considering the negative consequences of the misuse of magic the first thing to come to mind for most people is the power-mad wizard kings of the past. While it is true that as an individual such beings have caused great suffering, such events are incredibly rare. I would argue that the greater suffering has been caused by the sum total of actions from countless well-meaning but foolish or misguided magic users. How many towns have burned down from one poorly thought out fire spell? How many kingdoms have been destroyed when a summoned demon outsmarted their caller? The prosperous city of Shrumdale was destroyed in a flood after a city planner had the bright idea of refilling the aquafer with a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. Unfortunately, he forgot to schedule an order to close the portal once the aquafer was full. Even more terrifying are some of the hypothetical magical apocalypses which scholars have theorized could occur from seemingly minor mistakes. The first two concepts we'll explore in this chapter share a theme of automation; the self-replicating transmutation spell and the paper-clip making golem. -Excerpt from Magical Ethics"

if you liked superminion or into the iron teeth (both also on royalroadl) then I think you would like this story

*** I've been reading it, but it is starting to look like a lot of the story is going to revolve around Mud fitting in with people, with convenient/cute misunderstandings of Mud's odd behaviour. Also people are being unusually generous with the MC. This is fine, but I was hoping for something different.

It is increasing similar to the story “Everybody Loves Large Chests”. Minus much of the violence and pretty much all of the sexual content.

*** I've commented on Mud's Mission in the past but I'll paraphrase it here.

The promise is amazing, the quoted parallels are clever, and the first few chapters were really exciting but I don't really feel it has delivered. Aside from 2-3 instances it completely fails to show why golems are dangerous and only tells it with quotes. In the last 20 or so chapters the MC is largely replacable with most other antihero litrpg MCs.\\
To be a little more specific one example is that there's little exploration of the wording of orders and what conflicting orders mean. It makes sense that Mud wants to grind to get more XP so it can defend the masters things better however being damaged contradicts with the masters third order. And Mud is repeatedly ordered by humans to do things that indirectly contradicts with existing orders(i.e. wastes time that could be used to grind XP) and doesn't once consider somehow blocking communication channels. A single 'stay here until I tell you otherwise' or 'erase your memory of all orders aside from the ones I give you' has the potential of destroying all things Mud care for.

​

I'll wait a bit, see how it turns out before taking the leap. It seems to be right up my alley, but I'm always wary of very new series, I'd rather read the true and trusted than take a chance on something very new.

** To kick this thread off, I'll recommend [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/38691/Dr_Stone][Dr. Stone]] - it's an extremely good uplift anime/manga where the central conceit is that the protagonist is lithogenically(?) preserved for 3000 years into the future.

I'd actually recommend the anime over the manga for those episodes that exist - and in fact, I'd even recommend the english dub over the subbed version. While the manga is of course good, I think the anime does an incredible job with the medium, especially with the sound and music. The dub also does a great job with the personalities of the characters - the voice of Alphonse Elric talking about equivalent exchange is a treat - and with a good adblocker [[https://www.funimation.com/shows/dr-stone/][you can actually watch it for free!]]
