Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Northern Caves Munchkinry. The Northern Caves is a several thousand page “bargain-bin Finnegans Wake” consisting of a mix of gibberish, odd puns,surreal short stories full of grammatical errors, fragments of stories, and possibly a few encoded cyphers. By reading from it out loud, continuously, until an altered state of conscious is reached, you can gain several temporary abilities along with several side-effects.

Practice and the right drugs can possibly speed up entry to the altered state. In the first instance you know of it took around a day or two of reading with sleep deprivation, hunger, caffeine, and ADHD medication to enter the state.

The primary power, which has the shortest duration is to convince people to commit suicide. When you target someone with this ability, your words are strangely resonant with your target, seemingly random guesses on your part seem like deep insight to your target, and your target will feel a mix of overwhelming depression, disassociation. and intrusive thoughts. This power wears off after 1-3 usages, a few hours, or when you fall asleep, whatever comes first. It doesn't work on groups only up to around 3 people. It isn't absolutely guaranteed to work, for instance person who is already heavily depressed might be less susceptible. A target that refuses to listen to you at all, for instance covering their ears and making noise is entirely safe, although once they start listening to you it is very hard to stop.

The secondary power/side effect is an intense awareness of and aesthetic sense for spatial positioning and arrangement. The feeling is like an uncontrollable OCD and lasts until you get sleep.

As a tertiary effect, you experience strong synchronicity although the actual objective measurable effect is hard to disentangle from the subjective experience of the altered state of consciousness.

So ways to exploit these powers?

*** Is the spatial sense superhuman, or do I just get Fung Shui OCD until I sleep? Like could I solve word scrambles incredibly fast? How long does it take to suicide someone? Do I just say "Die" with the right inflection that it makes them want to, or does it take like half an hour or more to convince them? Do they do any talking while I convince them? Can I convince them over the phone? What if I'm using a voice modulator? If it's a one-way conversation, can I choose a target and prerecord it? If so does it have any effect at all on anyone else? If it's not just saying "die" to someone, what happens if I only go most of the way, but then stop talking instead of following through?

**** If it weren't for the distracting OCD aspect of it, it would be superhuman. With the distracting OCD, it comes out to peak savant human. So to use the word scramble example, you could solve it nearly instantly, except you would be distracted by the imperfection of the wood pulp that makes up the newspaper it is printed on and by the improper arrangement of the crossword puzzle hints and so you would only end up being able to solve it with savant speed and not obviously supernatural speed.

The time can be as short as a 30 second elevator pitch (for someone in an already vulnerable state of mind or life circumstances) to as long as 15-30 minutes (for a healthy, happy person actively resisting but still choosing to listen to you). As long as they aren't talking loud enough to block out what you are saying to them it should work. Over the phone works as long as you have a vague idea of who you are talking to. Voice modulator works but is slightly slower/less effective. Prerecording is unreliable, proportionate to how far in advance it is prerecorded and if you have a vague idea of the target (5 minutes in advance works almost as normal, several hours in advance is unreliable). Choosing the right time to stop talking is tricky, often you may think you stopped early enough only for the person to commit suicide anyway. But if you do manage to get the sweet spot of enough to affect your target but not enough that they kill themselves, they will be in a vulnerable and depressed state of mind for a few days.

You automatically and unconsciously adjust your suicide talk to whoever is listening. This is why it doesn't work on more than 3 people, too many people at once and nothing about it resonates with any single one of them enough.

****** I thought of a few more uses... based on your questions.

If you had minions capable of physically stopping someone from committing suicide, you could use induce the urge to commit suicide in your target, then physically restrain them and wait for the suicidal urges to wear off, taking advantage of their vulnerability in the meantime to indoctrinate them into a cult. If anyone tries to leave your cult, let them, then call them up a few days/weeks later and use your power. When they commit suicide, use that to intimidate your cult into obedience.

For the code example or mathematics in general you would need a spatial/physical/tactile representation of the problem. You then keep a specialized room prepared which has already been optimized to reduce the downsides of your OCD. Setup your problem, go into your altered state, then rapidly solve the problem in the physical setup, sleep it off, then reverse engineer the physical solution back to math notation.

** Any tips on how to limit the force a clay golem can generate per second total to move and do useful things without giving it the ability to focus all the force on a small area to create a fake firearm.

​

And how would you describe that limitation on a medieval setting. e.g as much power as a horse?

​

Or as I suspect limiting it this way will be too difficult to explain, how else would you limit a golem's strength on a hard magic setting ?

​

Assuming the ability to create golems is an inherent ability of a mage and not a constructed object that can be powered externally, how would you limit it's usage while still having it be useful? I was thinking maximum force per second output and a maximum daily force output that amounts to 30min of maximum force per second. But it's kind of difficult to explain in a medieval setting. Any ideas for this ?

*** Limit the force by volume of clay and have the force evenly distributed throughout the volume of clay. The force can only act on the clay itself. This will prevent exploits like the firearm. To prevent shape-shifting exploits the force pee unit volume of clay gets a multiplier/bonus when the clay is in an overall humanoid shape and when it exerts force consistent with a humanoid's means of exerting force.

To explain in medieval speak... an educated medieval person will have a concept of weight and density (although not necessarily of mass as separate from weight) and force is basically just weight. They should also have a basic idea of proportion and ratios even if they lack education on the full algebraic notation. So “Unformed, clay of the golem exerts strength just sufficient to match its own weight, move slowly, and maintain its shape. Furthermore, when given or allowed to assume the shape of man, the clay gains the addition of strength in imitation of man. The clay can exert its full strength for around half an hour, and then must rest for a day to recover its full strength. This time it can exert its strength is proportional to that strength exerted, if allowed to operate at half strength it can operate for a full hour, one quarter strength two hours, and so forth. A wise golem mage will carefully gauge the task so as to ensure sufficient time is allowed for the strength required before setting the golem to it.”

*** To prevent abuse of force concentration, just set a max pressure that the golem's clay can tolerate. This way doesn't limit the possible manipulations, but does prevent it from becoming a de facto gun or sword edge.

By doing this, you are essentially defining a hardness as well--the max force per unit area that the golem's body can withstand prior to deformation. Google says the average hardness of packed clay /in the ground , subsoil, for construction purposes/ is about 2-3N/mm^{2} (300-450 psi). This means that forming the golem's armor into a spear and stabbing, say, an armored man would see the spear crumble until its cross section is wide enough to bear the pressure on it. So if the golem swings with 10 kN (about twice as strong as a pro boxer) and hardness is 3N/mm^{2} (let's change that to 300N/cm^{2} to simplify) the spear would crumble until it had a cross section of 10000/300= 33.3 cm^{2} (about 10cm diameter). You can adjust the hardness of the clay to make the golem more or less able to concentrate force.

This ignores elastic and plastic deformation of the clay, which would get into spring constants and young's modulus and probably way more than you want to do.

You can get around all of this by making the golem use rock or metal for the pointy bits--it still won't be able to fire them like a gun. Or, more accurately, it can only accelerate bits of itself at a maximum of 450 psi; for a shotput, that's about 3 times as strong as an olympic athlete (note that the shotput throw is an inefficient use of muscles-- the olympic thrower puts out about 350N with a winning throw, while a pro boxer puts out about 5000 with a punch). If that's comparably strong to the rest of what the golem can do, nbd, otherwise adjust that max psi until its strength is reasonable.

**** Thank you this is very useful. The thing is, when you give it tools their abilities break. If for instance I give it a 350N and apply it to a 3g lead bullets, I get a high powered rifle.

So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I'm using a basic force equation. F=m*a, compared the values I got from rifles and the rifles seem to generate less force than thrower does with his arms.

I'm probably using the wrong formula, converting something incorrectly or messing up some unit. Because otherwise my numbers make little sense.

***** You're also assuming he can project himself at his maximum psi without stopping. That's the same thing as assuming the only thing limiting how hard our muscles can contract is their breaking point.

Just set a hard limit on the acceleration of the clay, say maybe 25 m/s^{2.} Google says a fast boxer can punch around 9m/s, so use that as a gage for how fast you want your golem to be able to punch in a humanoid form (assuming that's the max speed and you want a punch to be about as fast as a human punch which takes ~.25s, your avg punch acceleration is about 40 m/s^{2,} but golems are slow and heavy and lumbering so I would turn it down) could get around that by forming its arm into a sling, but hey--that is going to put a lot of pressure on the throwing arm. Better stay under that 3N/mm^{2} limit or else it'll fail.

So now you have a pressure limit to keep the golem from just hyucking boulders (where speed doesn't really matter) and an acceleration limit to prevent it from being a gun.

I'd also cap it's max velocity well below a full second of acceleration, personally, because 40 m/s is hella fast (getting into fastball speeds). So maybe 25-40 m/s^{2} acceleration that can only be maintained for 0.25s before topping out.

As far as legs this would make the golem about half as good at jumping as a human (google says we near 20 m/s^{2} during the fastest acceleration of a standing jump, although it's obviously not constant through the jump). That's fine for me since the golem can accelerate for far longer than a human; it can just keep extending its legs at its max acceleration until the cross section becomes too narrow to support pushing its mass at that acceleration.

Overall at these numbers a golem would totally physically overmatch a normal peak human, but most of that would come from its presumably large mass and ability to form clubs and attack from weird angles at speed.

It would be able to throw rocks really well, good enough to use as projectile weapons, but not as fast as an arrow or sling.

One issue I haven't solved is that it can still throw often, like a pitching machine. You could also limit that on a cognitive basis -- calculating trajectory and moving projectiles through the body and aiming all at once takes a lot of processing power, and the construct may only be able to do one throw every few seconds. Lord knows my 18mo son takes like 6 seconds to throw a ball and it goes straight up or backwards like 30% of the time.

Edit to add: you aren't doing anything wrong with the force equation. Bullets are fired with a relatively tiny amount of force, much less than a punch. If they fired with the force of a punch, the shooter would be taking all of thar force in his shoulder with every shot.

The magic of firearms comes from the ability to nearly instantly generate a huge amount of pressure (upwards of 60000 psi for a .308 round) behind a small, dense projectile. Because the equation for kinetic energy is KE=mv^{2} you are going to have a very energetic projectile, even though the force is low.

** Help me out here people (if you want too) :)

Here is the restrictions a character is under early in a story I've been drafting for almost 2 years.\\
* They know almost nothing about the world they have found themselves in other than of the 4 people they met out in the wilds, 3 tried to kill them, the fourth being the helpful one that told them the following things.\\
* There will be many people looking for an Arrival like our character. Dangerous People. Scrying magic is extremely potent in this world, so much so that every piece of information our character learns is a 'connection event' that a Scry could increase its location resolution on.\\
* They don't know the language/s or writing of this world, they are only able to communicate due to a Direct Meaning spell their helpful friend is currently maintaining, which they will not be able to keep up all the time, as again, that is a specific thing that others could Scry for.

- Knowing these limits, and that your helpful friend was reluctant to tell you even this much because of the danger. What questions would you absolutely need to ask anyway?\\
  I want to check the characters decisions are reasonable given these outlandish and highly restrictive limits.

**** It's learning that's the problem.\\
Consciousness is part of a vast sub-realm web related to magic, learning things about the world and how it works integrates a person further into the web. Normally this isn't that noticeable as people are learning small things. But someone in our characters position who is learning fundamental truths that govern the entire nature of the world... that lights up like a beacon to someone who is looking specifically for "brighter than usual" occurrences as its a thing well known to happen to new arrivals.\\
For example, when they learned magic was actually real is this place, that was like a flare gun in the middle of the night.

***** Then the priorities would be small things which immediately increase chances of survival. Like 'what is edible' 'nearest clean water source' 'do these things hunt by vision, scent, or only psychic resonance' 'what temperature will it be at night' etc.

As much as it's tempting to go searching for bigger picture stuff, not being immediately killed is very high priority, followed closely by not dying of natural causes within the first week. The why and what can wait.

*** I see things going their way, until reality ensues.

Ross and Rachel are dating from the very beginning of the show. Chandler quits his job as he knows he hates it. Monica and Chandler start dating. Monica quits her job as a waitress, confident that her chef skills will land her a job. Phoebe tries to find Mike, her younger brother, and her mother. Joey is happy.

Ross, unlike the others, keeps his current job going because he loves doing it, not because it's leading to something better. Of course, this means he leaves for the trip to China at the end of season 1, where he meets Julie again, and realizes why he fell in love with her to begin with. This time though, he already knows Rachel's the one he loves, and decides to cut off all contact with her, lightly changing the course of his career, a pattern which occurs time and time again (as with Charlie), leading him to new roadblocks in academia, and coupled with the abject redundancy of his current field, decides to use his future knowledge to excavate sites of future archaeological interest, effectively taking him away from Rachel and the rest of the group for extended periods of time.

Rachel slowly falls out of love with Ross, as she finds flames of the past that she's now emotionally mature enough to handle, and coupled with the fact that Emma's effectively dead, the two go on another "break", prompting Ross to dive into his work, isolating him from the group. Rachel applies to work at Ralph Lauren, and gets in. She uses her future knowledge to advance up the corporate ladder rapidly, forcing on her much higher expectations than she's used to, as a young "prodigy". She becomes disillusioned with fashion design and burns out, using the money she'd saved to live alone in the apartment she and Ross had rented.

Monica finds good work as a chef, and her relationship with Chandler remains solid for the next 10 years. However, they're still unable to conceive a child, and can't find an adoption agency that doesn't find them too young and inexperienced. Their lives are comfortable, yet missing an element they both desperately want. Chandler falls into a mild depression as he finds himself unable to give his wife a happy life. They finally adopt in 2002.

Joey lands Dr. Drake Remoray again, and this time is more level-headed in dealing with people. He gets better and better jobs, and eventually moves into a classier section of the city, and slowly loses touch with the others, only meeting now for holidays, which are incredibly joyous occasions.

Phoebe finds her family, but spooks Mike away. Miserable, she finds David, who she then forms a relationship with. They get married in 1998, and spend the next few years together, until the date of her actual wedding in the original timeline, when she feels so guilty about giving up on Mike that she leaves David, and eventually adjusts to a new modicum of happiness with her brother, mother, and three cats (her brother's).

Ross eventually comes back from exploration permanently in 2003, as he can no longer rely on his future knowledge to keep him going. His relationship with Rachel is heavily strained, and he's been away so long that he no longer really recognizes the people the others have become, and moves in with Joey (both of them are very rich now, but they want the company).

On the night of May 6, 2004, the last day they lived in the original timeline, they get together again, all six of them properly, for the first time in years.

And Ross, being the largest friend, eats the other five, fulfilling that ancient prophecy.
