Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Any recommendations for favorite mobile games? I found Kingdom Rush again, a well-made tower defense game, and saw they had new versions/expansions available, but I'm interested in what other strategy/RPG games people play on mobile.

*** I have played a lot of games, but I couldn't bring myself to uninstall a few. Monument Valley I, II and Alto's Adventure and Odyssey. They're so beautifully designed and it's just plain relaxing to play them. Gorgeous elucidation geometry ftw! (Monument Valley) Or just sliding down the mountain on your snowboard trying catch your runaway llamas, watching the scenery shift with time of the day or weather.. (Alto)

Limbo, if you want an atmospheric challenging plaformer. It's out on mobile now too. So many deaths.. and I love it.

Boson X - where you play as a professor running through a Hadron Collider ever accelerating. Running and jumping from platform to platform, with the slightest misstep resulting in annhilation. Pretty much like Super hexagon in a way, minimalistic. I loved how they made the movement rotational.

Gathering Sky - a short one. You play as a flock of birds, transversing a handpainted land below..

Smash Hit. There's something utterly serene about being able to toss balls shattering glass walls.

Like you have guessed I mostly stick to the indie games. The list could go on and on.. I was thinking of finishing Samoroast 3 and Old man's journey. As for Rpgs.. I have a Nitendo DS emulator and Roms. Need I say more? ^_^

*** Gumballs and Dungeons.

It's not really like any other game I've played or seen. The best way to describe it is...... not a gacha game? It somehow achieves all of the things gacha games are trying to evoke via collecting characters and powering them up and stuff, without adopting most of their crappy mechanics:

1. There is genuine gameplay, you run through dungeons in a sort of roguelite dungeon crawling clicky thing, as opposed to sitting there watching your characters fight for you. Your strategy and tactics matter, and there is a lot of complexity in the type of builds you can do, even if you end up clicking through it without thinking much on the easier levels.

2. (most) Characters are acquired in specific ways, not via random lottery. If you want a specific character, this is a specific method you can do on purpose to get that character, guaranteed.

3. Characters can be upgraded by acquiring more of their fragments (generally by doing the original task to unlock them repeatedly), not by absorbing other characters

4. Characters are unique, you don't dozens of duplicates of a character and have to do this stupid inventory management to get rid of them

5. Each character provides a small global buff, either strengthening your party or your resource rate or something just for owning them, so even characters you never use in your main party are still valuable to collect (and most of these buffs are unique so you have an incentive to seek out specific characters with buffs you want).

6. The game is relatively generous with giving out premium currency. You get some for daily logins, achievements, and can even grind it in certain dungeons if you want. More importantly, the quantity it gives versus the quantity required to progress in the game is well-balanced (and most characters are unlocked via gameplay, not premium currency) so you can easily play the game free-to-play without suffering.

I highly recommend at least checking it out, it's unlike any game I've ever played and is a lot of fun.

** I went to Harvard's admitted students weekend this weekend. I know the entire point of the programming is to sell the school to attendees but goddamn they did a good job.

I walked out feeling like I was now a member of their "club" and now that I'm in, I can basically never be kicked out. I've struggled most of my life to make my own path and be noticed on the strength of my own accomplishments. It always felt like no one noticed except for my spouse. But now I have been noticed and accepted, and instead of blazing my own trail I can stop trying so fucking hard and follow an easy, well-worn path to greatness. It's a fucking relief. And vindicating.

I also loved that every person I met this weekend was /smart/. I didn't click with everyone, but without exception I got the sense that everyone was talented and had hidden depths. I'm not sure how much of that was confirmation bias, but it ... it felt really nice.

Junior high fucking sucked. High school sucked. College sucked even more. Then I spent years and years working /alone/. But now it finally feels like I've finally found a group where I can fit in and be comfortable.

...I'll be sure to make a post after finals roll around and my rose-tinted glasses have shattered.

That said, it's really baffling to me how different countries have different "standards" for marks. Like, in Australia, a passing mark is 51% and an 80% is a high distinction. So my instinct upon hearing someone say "at best I got 80%, hooray" sarcastically is me going "wow someone has excessive self expectations" rather than the more appropriate to circumstance "this poor person is going to be lucky to get a (B?? what's 80% in your neck of the woods?)"

But then again I guess there's no reason why 80% or 50% or 20% should be a "good" or "bad" mark, it's all arbitrary and depends on the difficulty of the test.

Yeah, it's weird they make you do physics and stuff. I think it's because a lot of the time you end up diversifying like crazy in engineering. Like, I did a civil engineering degree, and I'm a traffic engineer now but virtually nothing I did in my degree relates to my job, and yet I can see the skills I learned in unrelated parts of the degree are really super transferable (interpreting at the Australian Standards for steel construction --> interpreting Austroads Standards for road safety). So although the physics itself may not be a useful skill, PROBABLY the ability to learn equations, understand how they work, implement them, etc are what this subject /actually/ means in your real life.

That said, all the multivariable calculus I learned has been thoroughly useless. Me and a very senior engineer managed to thoroughly confuse each other over /basic algebra/ (as in, 3.7x = 87, solve for x level algebra).

** I have been reading up on weight management and obesity lately.. An excerpt from the beginning of Gary Taubes's Why We Get Fat:

​

#+begin_quote
  "When insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat---not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells. “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat,” is how George Cahill, a former professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, recently described this to me."
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  "In other words, the science itself makes clear that hormones, enzymes, and growth factors regulate our fat tissue, just as they do everything else in the human body, and that we do not get fat because we overeat; we get fat because the carbohydrates in our diet make us fat. The science tells us that obesity is ultimately the result of a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one---specifically, the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate-rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high-fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary."
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  "This is the fundamental reality of why we fatten, and if we're to get lean and stay lean we'll have to understand and accept it, and, perhaps more important, our doctors are going to have to understand and acknowledge it, too.

  If your goal in reading this book is simply to be told the answer to the question “What do I do to remain lean or lose the excess fat I have?” then this is it: stay away from carbohydrate-rich foods, and the sweeter the food or the easier it is to consume and digest---liquid carbohydrates like beer, fruit juices, and sodas are probably the worst---the more likely it is to make you fat and the more you should avoid it.

  This is certainly not a new message. Until the 1960s, as I'll discuss later, it was the conventional wisdom. Carbohydrate-rich foods---bread, pasta, potatoes, sweets, beer---were seen to be uniquely fattening, and if you wanted to avoid being fat, you didn't eat them."

Insulin is the key player in weight gain it would seem. I did end up confused by his views on legumes, vegetables and the meat exclusiveness though. The advice on carbs and glycemic index was sound. Also, anyone here has any experience with intermittent fasting? How do you go about it?

The book is pretty old already, so it doesn't take into account the gut microbiome. Up-to-date diets need to take the gut microbiome into account ;).

​

As a data point, btw. the most efficient way for me to gain weight is to eat lots of nuts (peanuts because they are cheap).

A non-carbohydrate diet is kind of a luxury, as well. Not many on humans on this planet can afford this diet. This is also why historically, most people would eat potatoes, grain, rice or corn if they would get anything to eat at all. 15-45 million people died in a famine in China in 1959--1961.

**** The gut microbiome is overblown by popular science, it's a minor factor for most people. If it was so practically important we would just be giving everyone fecal transplants but aside from C. diff and a very recent autism study we don't see it as very useful. Unless you have major digestive problems you don't need to focus on it since a healthy well balanced diet, which should be your goal for weight loss, is beneficial for your gut anyway. If you want to go out of your way to help it just eat yogurt daily.

Weirdly enough all the correlation studies I've seen associate nuts with lower bodyweight and waist size. Dieticians I've listened to talking about it are confused too since they are so calorie dense but our best guesses are: those people eat salty nuts instead of other less filling salty snacks like chips, and that it could be correlated with higher income or healthier cultures.

  These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary.
#+end_quote

Carbs /drive you to accumulate fat/, /make you hungrier/, and /make you sedentary/. This isn't saying anything at all about the fundamentals of thermodynamics, it's saying something about the fundamentals about how humans interact with food. If the premise is true, then someone attempting to lose/manage weight who doesn't cut out carbs is going to be fighting an uphill battle, because they won't want to work out or exercise, and they'll constantly be hungry even when they've met their caloric needs.

A large part of what makes diet and exercise work for people is minimizing the amount of willpower and action needed to maintain that diet and exercise. CICO is a real and important aspect of dieting, but if you attempt to meet some restrictive caloric intake while still taking in a lot of carbs, you're very likely to fail your diet fairly quickly. It drives me nuts that people will fundamentally misunderstand that aspect of dieting and criticize anything that takes it into account as thermodynamic denialism. It goes hand-in-hand with CICO.

(Now, if you wanted to criticize the science of carbohydrates in relation to insulin or something, that might be a different story.)

***** The original post seems to be talking about how people gain weight, and I agree that CICO doesn't give much information on that. It's true that if you want to lose weight, spending more calories than you eat necessarily means you lose weight, but the reverse isn't necessarily true. Eating more calories than you spend could result in no change in weight, weight gain, or even lost weight depending on how your body absorbs it. Saying that carbs can cause you to accumulate fat is helpful knowledge, because at some point you are going to have to eat more calories than you spend, and most people want to keep the weight off that they just spent so much time losing.

****** CICO is the best predictor of weight gain we have, there's only one edge case I know of: zero fat diets. The human body basically cannot create fat molecules (de novo lipogenisis), so if your body doesn't have fat to store while intaking excess calories you essentially can't put on fat but you also won't be burning it. This isn't common knowledge, or very useful, since any healthy diet consumes some amount of fat. If you consume excess calories with fat your body tends towards burning the carbohydrates you have and storing fat until it balances out.

Practically speaking though telling people carbs make them fat isn't productive, we don't have an obesity problem from eating too many fruits or vegetables for example. The only blanket statement I'd support is that refined sugar makes it easier to put on weight in a negative way.
