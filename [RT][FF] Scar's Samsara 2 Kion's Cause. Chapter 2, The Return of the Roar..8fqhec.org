** So in writing this second chapter, I faced a new challenge: I have five new characters that I don't expect my readership to know or care about. And I know from my own experience in consuming media that nothing is more damaging to a story than not giving a shit about the characters.

I knew I had to make all the new characters stand out, but that's difficult when you also have to justify your main character (who has the problem of not being Scar) at the same time, and all in the span of a few pages. So instead, I decided to have Kion say nothing while the focus is on Bunga, and then have the personalities of the other characters show in their reaction to his antics. I think this works in Kion's case because he's a stoic, and you can still get a feel for his character through the narration - and I have to say, after years of writing Naruto and Scar, it's kind of nice to have a main character who keeps his mouth shut now and then :p

So what do you guys think? Did this work? Do the characters seem interesting so far, or is it a case of 'meh, they're not Scar'?

Second question: How do you all feel about the update speed? In the past I always updated once a week while spending the time in between to edit the (pre-written) chapters, but I kind of feel like people might have half-forgotten the previous chapter by the time they get the next one, and it takes them out of the story. Would it be better to do bi-weekly updates, and not worry about the editing as much?

Let me know what you think! I'd love some feedback on these points :)

*** Regarding character description, it would be great if you could make it more obvious in the text which character is which species, since it's much easier to identify “the hippo is doing this thing” and then later associate the name with that character. This is especially true at the beginning of a fic like there where you introduced a bunch of characters (from the show) who are new to your audience.

Regarding update speed, I'm happy either way. Once a week is still much more frequent than most fics I read. Do whatever will make you happier and less likely to burn out.
