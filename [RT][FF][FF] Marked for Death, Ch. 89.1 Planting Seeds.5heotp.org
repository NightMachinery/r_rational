** So, googling around for flower meanings:

#+begin_example
  holly: Defense; Domestic Happiness  
  hyndragea: heartfelt emotions / white lily: humility and devotion 
  cherry blossoms: fragility and the beauty of life  
  daffodil: rebirth and new beginnings  
  cactus bud: warmth, protection and endurance  
#+end_example

Hazo is pregnant?

*** There was a lot of discussion of this in-thread, and [[/u/EagleJarl][u/EagleJarl]] reminded us that we should base our analysis on Japanese culture rather than western ones. The western reading is something like "Your beauty calls my spirit to persevere in its pure and chivalrous love for you until you welcome me past your cold exterior to begin our lives together in domestic bliss", with extra hints of 'being her defender'.

Japanese symbolism:

Holly: "Looking (Single and "--")"

Hydrangea: Pride

White Lily: Purity/Chastity

Cherry blossoms: Kind/Gentle

Daffodil: Respect

(Just flowering) Cactus: (beginnings of) Lust/Sex

This is basically the flower language equivalent, when combined with Hazou's totally straight-faced delivery, of "I think I like you and you're really pretty and I promise I don't mean anything nasty or dirty but if you tried to kiss me I wouldn't say no and do you maybe like me back?"

Like, third-grader "do you like me circle y / n" - tier shit. Mari is a goddamn genius.

** Important thing to know: [[/u/Velorien]] and I typically don't have time to review with each other before writing and publishing. We know the worldbuilding, we have planning sessions, but each release is a surprise to the other author.

As I read through this chapter I was commenting in real time with [[/u/Velorien]] via the GM chat. About halfway through I say "this is either the most epic plot twist ever, or you are messing with my head in a truly epic way."

Then I found the answer.
