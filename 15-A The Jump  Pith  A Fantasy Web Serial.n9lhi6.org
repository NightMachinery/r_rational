  I spent the second night awake, too. Everything felt uncomfortable. The bed, the rocking motion of the ship, my body -- everything. I was still getting used to this new, old form, its obscenely smooth skin, and its new proportions. /Doesn't normally take me this long./

I really appreciate that not only has the story consistently portrayed Nell as having gender dysphoria (and Wes as having gender euphoria, for that matter), it's also been consistent in having her not /recognize/ her gender dysphoria. It's a nice counterpoint to Ana, whose dysphoria was portrayed in a very visceral way and served as her driving motivation. It does a good job of demonstrating how there isn't a singular "trans experience," and I think that's a pretty rare thing to see.

  “Your engagement to the Pakhems is the future of this family. They possess money and influence, and their older children are also fighting in the field. Which means if they die, Samuel will become the sole heir to their fortune and influence.”

Can somebody please just murder this psycho? The world would be a much better place without Admiral Ebbridge in it.

  A tall, broad-shouldered attractive man, with a thick brown beard and biceps that looked ready to burst all his clothes.

  The last time I'd seen that body, it had been blackened, burnt to a shriveled, crispy mess by the Pyre Witch, its hand still clutching a pitch-black rapier.

  “Professor Oakes?” I half-shouted. “/You're alive?/”

I don't trust this for a fucking second. I have no idea what's going on, but I refuse to believe that Oakes survived, I refuse to believe they'd let the senile headmaster come to the battlefront, I refuse to believe they'd let Oakes have a picnic in plain sight of any wandering soldier when his survival is supposed to be a top secret, and I refuse to believe they'd let Nell go without mindwiping her. Any one of those things in isolation you could probably explain away, but all of them? Nope. No way.

*** So what are the craziest possible theories? She met two random other entities out there that camouflaged themselves with people from her mind (she had been looking for Tau, afterall)? She got mindwiped and given something else to fill the missing time? Tau is creating homunculi? The reality warping of the Spirit Block is part of some broader reality warping that allowed them to bring back Oakes?

**** I'm kind of leaning toward the homonculi or something tbh. my first thought was that it's definitely related either to Tau's vocation or Egress, but I'm 65% sure Tau isn't in the know (from his darkness in paragon comment, but also it seems like Egress is heavily related to the spirit block), and I don't know how a Praxis vocation would help you resurrect somebody... maybe he took the Oakes from some other reality on the other side of the Spirit Block????? Like Max's dreams.

*** A little late, but the thing that bothers me most about pith is the complete inability of characters to consider body swapping despite it occurring so often. Anabelle swapped in the beginning, Radio Man was forcefully swapped, Ana and Wes saw the collection of glass brains, Maxine Clive apparently lives for body swapping (even though she isn't a projector), Jun swapped with his father, Grace was going to swap with Ana to fake her death, Commonwealth swapped to get an infiltrator into Paragon, etc. And yet everyone is always astonished!!! Even though it can be initiated forcefully!

Furthermore, how do you even tell people apart when they're in the same designer bodies?

It feels unrealistic without any limits on it and nobody having secret signals or codes to prevent infiltration, other than the secret, rare pith signatures of Paragon.

Queen Sulpher constantly feels like a group of punchers in a world controlled by mentalists and it's hard to believe some whisper specialist hasn't casually mind controlled them yet.

Anyway, I agree that the whole Sebastian survived thing is ridiculous, but I'm taking it at face value for now because it fits with how body swapping has been treated in this series as a whole.

I still read it, though, because the quality and mysteries are so much better than the average serial I check out.
