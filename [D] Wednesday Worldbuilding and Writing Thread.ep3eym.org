Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Alright, I've been playing around with the idea of taboo magic, specifically, magic that is powered by the discomfort/disgust/fear surrounding societal taboos, after which that power can then be released by breaking those taboos. This is essentially meant to be the "Black Magic" of a setting and I have a few ideas for which taboos will cause which effects, but mostly the idea is that these effects reinforce the taboos. For example, bestiality, if you have sex with an animal it could turn into a bloodthirsty mutant version of itself which you have minor control over (it probably won't kill you). Another aspect of this magic system is locality, a cannibalistic society will experience little to no magical effects when taking part in the taboo of cannibalism, while a community of religious zealots might pass out from hearing someone blaspheme. How do you think society would try to work around this? I think the lowest hanging fruit would be to hide the existence of taboo magic since knowledge of it would likely lead to stronger feelings towards the taboos, which would cause the effects to be even more extreme. I'm also curious about what effects you guys might come up with for certain taboos.

Here's a list of the taboos I've thought of so far:

bestiality, necrophilia, killing family members, plain old murder, homosexuality, cannibalism, abortion, rape, atheism, apostasy, blasphemy, incest, pedophilia

let me know if I'm missing some obvious ones.

**** Yeah, you might not be able to get large settlements at all. Any group of people bigger than 200 or so would generate an antisocial warlock who would blow the community apart. Then the little fragments would scatter and grow into new communities. I suppose you might have larger groups if the antisocial warlock in question forced people to stay together...

****** I could quibble about nature versus nurture but actually you're on to something interesting! If an antisocial warlock does try to build a permanent state, the basis for the warlock's magic will quickly erode. The new taboos will be whatever threatens the warlock, which will grant any would-be rebellion a huge advantage. There will be a very dependable cycle of regime change (probably about one per generation). Unless! The warlock keeps the precise nature of the broken taboo a secret (performing the taboo in front of witnesses who are then killed). Or else the warlocks foster their children out among the people most ideologically opposed to them. So their heirs will inherit the kingdom, even if they hate everything their parents stood for.

*** Sexual behavior in general: adultery, sexually active, multiple partners, exhibitionism, revealing clothing, orientation.

Taboos involving hierarchies. Disrespect of authority, elderly/those older than you, the country, family, social leaders.

Taboos involving speech. Wrongthink, cussing, sarcasm, lying, misleading, not speaking, yelling, bringing attention to the elephant in the room.

Things involving personal space. Eating or taking other people's stuff, putting your hands in other people's pockets, entering private property. (All without permission of course)

How society reacts depends on what other forms of magic is available.

** Our civilization is severely flawed. Inefficient systems of governance susceptible to various forms of corruption, economic systems which reward financial entities for acting as sociopathic profit-maximizers, legal systems full of holes and awkward constructions, nonsensical traditions and irrational social norms, predatory and harmful ideologies. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive][Perverse incentives]] which threaten to turn any good cause into an evil, [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Moloch]] which tempts us to compete each other into extinction, [[https://equilibriabook.com/toc/][inadequate equilibria]] which cause any system to make obvious disastrous mistakes if no specific individual in power is positioned to profit from fixing them, various cognitive biases which make us, and therefore the general public, vulnerable in hundreds of ridiculous ways.

Our world is a pretty bleak place. What if it was worse?

I'm looking for miscellaneous ideas about how a human civilization could be set up in more inefficient, more carelessly harmful ways. Specifics:

- Something cyberpunk-esque and dystopian, but focused on social/organizational horror, not the horrors of new technology ending up in the wrong hands. Systems which commit atrocities and engage in inhumane/stupid policies despite being composed of normal people, not specific evil/stupid people ending up in power and deliberately making everything worse.

- Technology level should be roughly on the level of modern Earth, though one-two instances of slightly futuristic technology is acceptable. On the surface, the resultant world should be roughly recognizable as real-life Earth, just /worse/.

- The ideas shouldn't be too arbitrary or obviously designed to be pointlessly evil (e. g., a federal law which bans consistent sleep schedule). But don't worry about historical plausibility beyond that. You're not bound to real-life Earth history either, come up with whatever geopolitical situation and social customs you'd like.

  - However, I suspect that there are some great examples of horrific systems to be found in real-life Earth's history, so don't hesitate to mention those.

- A possible way to put it: what is to our Earth what our Earth is to [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/81447230971/my-april-fools-day-confession][dath ilan]]?

I'm also interested in media which features such settings.

*** Given your restrictions, the best way to make a worse Earth is to add more bureaucracy.

Add layers between problems and people capable of solving them. Certifications are required to legally do things, like putting out fires. Copyrighting and patents are more restrictive and abstract. Some general patents were deemed too broad, but specific categories were not. Mega-conglomerates are still at war over keystone patents like "educational films" and "heart surgery".

Add layers between reality and people making the big decisions (an absurd example would be having a pyramid of bean counters gathering statistics from each other. The leaders make decisions based off of the numbers from the bean counters directly below them, like a giant AI neural network with no training and improper feedback.)

However, for such a society to be miserable and deadly, I think you would need something to balance it out to explain how it doesn't end itself. Something like an AI who makes sure everyone at least has gruel to eat and makes sure enough test tube babies are grown to maintain population.

Edit: Kafka's works would be one of the best examples of this.

**** I love this so much. Want to buy and use over-the-counter medications? You need to take a course, then pass a test to get a license for home medication administration. Then, every year you have to mail printed certificates of completion of annual continuing education credits to maintain your license. The course costs $600 to take, the test is $150 for each attempt, and the credits cost $50 to enroll in each year. You also need to keep a record of every medication you use (date, time, who it was given to, what the dose was).

Want to have knives with sharp blades, perhaps in your kitchen? You have to get a permit for that. You need four people outside of your family to write affidavits which affirm that you can be trusted with sharp objects. You'll need to write a sign a contract requiring you to keep any sharp objects in a locked container, and then submit an application with your form, affidavits, and receipt for the locked container to the local sheriff's office, plus a $50 processing fee. You'll get your permit in three to six months, as long as the sheriff's office doesn't have any problems with your documentation. Having unlocked sharp objects in your home is a Class A misdemeanor. Just imagine how guns are handled.

Fires at home aren't allowed. No grilling, no gas stoves, no wood/gas furnaces, no fireplaces, no campfires, no candles, no lighters, no matches, period. Cooking with fire has to be done in a properly-licensed commercial restaurant. Home heating has to be done electrically with ceramic heating elements. Smoking is obviously banned as a consequence.

The black markets that all of this would create would be absolutely insane. This could make for a very interesting cyberpunk-esque dystopian setting.

***** My understanding is that Venezuela already works like that. Almost everyone has semi-illegal side jobs, often farming currency in MMORPGs, which give them US dollars to buy food and other necessities on the black market, as official sources for those things are woefully inadequate. They have electricity and internet - except when they don't - but the stuff you actually need to live? All obtained illegally.

For a while, the actual Bolívar - Dollar exchange rate was recorded and maintained by [[https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-01/venezuelas-currency-value-depends-largely-one-guy-alabama-home-depot][one dude in Alabama.]] That's how bad their situation is.

*** First, regress society. Have the government be plutocracy or theocracy instead of democracy. Reintroduce caste or feudal systems. Have slavery and child labour. Abolish modern banking. Get rid of minimum wage and social benefits. Make people ignorant of the fields of economics and logistics.

Second, demote modern social values. Promote racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and others of the sort. Have justice be based on "guilty until proven innocent". Raise the age for which people can enter the workforce. Increase individual competitiveness and decrease trust. Promote colonialism and war.

Third, restrict information. Privatise the internet. Incentivise the media to report misinformation and fear mongering. Have the media be controlled by organisations with biased interests.

Fourth, slow scientific progress. Let anyone publish into academia. Abolish the peer review system. Promote fear of the sciences, and let anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers be in the majority.

Fifth, curb human rights and sustainable development goals. Increase the wealth gap. Make basic healthcare and education only available to the rich. Increase the cost of water and electricity. Create monopolies everywhere. Close countries' borders and let nothing in or out.

Sixth, change the spending of the government. Focus on building highways that lead to nowhere rather than public goods and services. Increase military funds. Increase taxes, or decrease them to zero.

The change could be a result of wrong lessons learnt from history, incompetence of leaders, ignorance of leaders, or as core values of the major religion in countries.

*** Profit motive is everything, and everything is done through corporations.

Corporations are considered voting citizens, and only corporations have the vote. The corporate vote is /supposed/ to reflect the average desires of the employees of the corporation, but exactly how this is measured is left to individual corporations, and many corporations are believed to completely ignore the results of their own internal vote and simply submit the CEO's preferences. (This is important, because the power of a corporation's vote is a function of its number of employees; a corporation ten times larger has ten times the vote). (It might create an even worse world if 'number of employees' in the previous parenthesis is replaced with 'audited net profit').

A corporation controls /everything/ for its employees. It houses them, feeds them, provides them with medical care, offers them a selection of entertainment, provides (and, if necessary, filters) their internet. The company may also charge for these services. Of course, with promotion comes benefits (e.g. having choices on the menu other than Nutrient Slop Version 4, Shrimp Flavour) and directors have /great/ lives. Children are (usually) automatically employed by their parents' corporation from birth; while there may be marriages between employees of different corporations, these are rare enough that most people have heard only vague stories of them.

Politicians basically rubber-stamp what corporations want. By and large, the only laws that apply to employees are those set by their corporation.

Individual corporations have a range of internal conditions. However, some of the biggest and most influential corporations have internal conditions that start out at "sweat shop" and work down from there, because not paying for anything nice for your workers turns out to be a /great/ way to cut costs.

**** If you want to go a step further, you could have big corporations lobby for and achieve legalized corporate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality][extraterritoriality]]. Sufficiently large corporations can then designate properties of theirs which, while technically being within the country, fall under their own jurisdiction and laws. You might have defense contractors lobbying to essentially have their own private military forces to defend their facilities with full legal authorization to handle trespassers as they see fit. Not only can they shoot on sight, even using AA and AT missiles, but they could also arrest people and hold them indefinitely if they so choose. CEOs can then hide from the proletarians within the walls of their militarized corporate complexes.

With the return of privatized military forces, you might have a massive surge in defense contractors, more or less making the national military force irrelevant. Soldiers mostly work for Lockheed-Martin-Boeing, GM-GE-Exxonshell, Academi (formerly Blackwater), Applesoft, and Fox-Disney now. The Department of Defense might have its own small military force, but for the most part, it simply pays the contractors to contribute their forces to the war effort.

Soon enough, you've got private contractors fighting each other, you get into an arms race, and then you have contractors lobbying to have WMDs as a deterrent. Soon enough, Applesoft is operating its own nuclear submarines to ensure against incursions by Fox-Disney. Welcome to the dawn of corporate feudalism.

*** For historical crummy examples: Classical Sparta and (more than two thousand years later) the Antebellum American South had very similar crappy systems. Permanent slave caste stuck in place doing agricultural labor to free the upper class up to do something else. In both cases the upper class put a lot of work into keeping the slave class down, and spent a lot of time worrying about revolts. They had a tiger by the tail. But the two societies had different terrible add-on effects.

In Sparta, the upper class were soldiers, and built up an invincible-warrior mystique because they spent all their time drilling. If contemporary accounts are to be believed, they were a kind of police state where all the boys grew up in barracks--assuming they weren't exposed at birth for being sickly. Paranoia about Spartan aggression (versus Athenian imperialism) was a contributing factor to the Peloponnesian War that tore Greece apart for decades.

In the South the ruling class were expected to be a more leisured kind of aristocrat, and that upper class was itself subdivided into different social classes. Since the big landowners tended to buy up all the land, everybody else was stuck squatting on a few acres apiece, with no hope of social mobility. The system wasn't just bad for black people--most whites had far worse economic prospects than their northern counterparts. But they supported the slave system anyway, because free labor would have entailed accepting social equality with blacks, which was intolerable. A good part of Northern hostility to slavery stemmed from their recognition that there was no place for free white labor in a slave system.

(I write [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/][a serial]] set in a horribly dysfunctional society as well--and post updates on here--but it's not modern or cyberpunk and the world is drastically different from ours)

*** - *Killer bots:* Inexpensive mass-produced swarms of semi-autonomous [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA][slaughterbots]]. We already have the technology, we just need someone evil enough, wealthy enough, and greedy enough to make it happen on an industrial scale.

- *Strict corporate internet censorship:* This would be imposed to create a paywall to improve profits, like [[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2009/images/10/28/net.neutrality.chart.jpg][this]]. Meanwhile, anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, or anti-establishment websites effectively get shut off.

- *Routine genetic analysis in employment screening:* Similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca][Gattaca]], with employees being excluded from certain types of jobs for having suboptimal genes (like women with BRCA genes being prohibited from working in radiology or nuclear power, for example). This creates growing pressure for parents who can afford to do so to get prenatal genetic screening and abort children who aren't genetically optimal. Children of poor parents often end up doubly screwed, both with genetic disabilities and exclusion from various occupations.

- *Intense proliferation of connector standards:* Not everything is horrible, sometimes it just sucks. New Apple® wall outlets for charging Apple devices (doesn't work with anything else), Microsoft® wall outlets, GE® wall outlets, etc. Every manufacturer starts trying to build a monopoly and force consumers to use their products exclusively, somehow creating a more annoying situation than an actual monopoly. The connectors are all patented, and the manufacturers don't sell adapters.

- *Flying cars:* Yeah, yeah, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moller_M400_Skycar][futuristic utopia]], right? No. Fuck no. Flying drunk drivers. Flying drivers texting on their smartwatches. Poorly maintained flying cars suffering mechanical failures in the air. Fuel consumption massively increased compared to regular cars, meaning more pollution, more CO2, and /way/ more noise. Sounds bad, but what's worse is that you actually /have/ to get one because otherwise you're going to be stuck in the traffic jams for hours trying to get to work, and public transportation is even slower. Yay flying cars!?

*** If you want to make a situation worse, you could always add more Nazis.

The Nazi regime wasn't going to be stable no matter what they did. Their central tenets just violate humanity's empathetic drive too much. If they had managed to force the UK's surrender and been able to turn inward, maintaining their reign would have required them to recruit more psychopaths into important positions than exist. The Europe they left behind would be a shell of its former self.

This would have significant knock-on effects. Eugenics would not have been so harshly rebuffed as a science, as the Nazis could have kept the extermination camps an open secret rather than a heavily-advertised blight and international shame, known to every schoolchild in nearly every nation. Eugenics efforts against native populations the world over may have continued far longer. In the US, the civil rights movement would have been far weaker, as returning black soldiers would be seen as failures rather than heroes. China, Korea, and the rest of the South Pacific would be a depopulated, smoking ruin due to the depredations of Imperial Japan...

I don't really care to imagine this world further, but you can if you want.
