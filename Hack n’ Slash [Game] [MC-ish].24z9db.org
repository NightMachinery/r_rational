** Have played the game through all of it available through to the current end (note - there's apparantly a conclusion coming). For what it is it's pretty good, but there were some less good bits as well.

I am going to offer generalities without spoilers and then get into the meat of the game with spoilers.

- Good, fun puzzles that are easy to do if you have the answer and difficult to progress past accidentally without solving with one major exception.
- Game visuals are initially good but eventually become both repetitive and cluttered (might be reflective of Alpha state).
- Soundtrack and sounds not particularly good or memorable.
- A few attempts at humor.
- Controls are not good on a keyboard, and further there are some precision moving segments and a LOT of segments where you can 'fall and die' without losing anything but slowing progress down.
- Game length is not terribly substantial. I made a huge and stupid error that required a great deal of backtracking and still finished in ~4 hours.
- Has potential for a little sandbox play, but really at the point where you're considering doing anything involving programming in Lua with a sword, you might as well just drop it and get an actual compiler and make sprite-based art assets or whatever of your own - it would certainly be easier and more flexible. Perhaps eventually more play via e.g. user-created puzzles will be added?

--- Begin Spoilers ---

Firstly, the game controls feel sloppy and imprecise on a keyboard, and there are mandatory movement puzzles which require fairly decent precision control. The worst of these is a sewer level in the dark with no art assets or appreciable music moving from one blue square to another moving blue square. Whoever thought this was a good idea was super incorrect. These segments add basically nothing to the game and are basically garbage. I feel similarly about the 'stealth' (sort of) segments - a couple rooms with guards you can reprogram and rescript would be neat, but the fourth or fifth palls.

The core of the gameplay is essentially a puzzler where you get to manipulate your environment in a bunch of programming-themed ways to progress. Initially it's running around sticking a USB sword into things to change variables. You get a couple global variable editor items that let you manipulate one global variable. Then eventually you start being able to edit object's code - you can't manipulate program flow at all, and only for certain objects at first. Eventually it opens up to breaking open most in-game objects only right before it ends (with only one puzzle using that element at all). There are a few button and switch style puzzles that rely on you looking at the game's object names and such with a special filter. It's sort of neat.

So mostly it's a puzzle-themed sprite based game. The plot is paper thin and almost to the point I'd rather there was no plot and just puzzle-based gameplay. There aren't that many of the actual programming puzzles, and most of what there are took around an hour to solve, a lot of which was spent walking back and forth.

There was one puzzle where the reward was not obviously given to the player. I missed it and thought I had to decypher a runic script by hand (I got the rosetta reward but didn't realize you had to move on it and press a button to get the reward to update all text in e.g. interfaces to a normal alphabet). This caused a lot of backtracking when I realized that, which was a while later.

Also, the game crashed like ~5 times to desktop for no real reason. There were a couple times when I entered something strange in the sword-based Lua editor that it crashed legitimately and made me restart the screen, and one it crashed because I set turtles to spawn almost infinitely and at a nonlimited rate. Overall, more crashes were the dev team's fault than mine.

The save and resume system is a great feature. Every time you enter a new screen, it saves and makes a node on a tree for you with the full current gamestate connected to the previous node. You can exit your current node to go from any other node and branch off from it at any time. It's basically the most friendly puzzle game mechanic for having permanent ways to mess things up.

Would not recommend paying full price for this alpha software. Wait until full release and check reviews then to see if it is better, or wait for it to show up in a humble bundle or otherwise for cheap.

** Essentially, an affectionate parody of Zelda. Can't comment anything gameplay wise, it's still in the early access phase.

But hacking in terms of game mechanics, kinda munchkinesque. You get to reprogram object properties, hijack global variables, hack creature behavior, etc. I thought it was an interesting take. Plus the artwork's gorgeous.

** I haven't played Hack n' Slash personally (yet) but I probably will eventually, based mostly on Double Fine's previous products - especially Psychonauts, which remains one of my favorite platforming type games of all time.

Psychonauts was just a really amazingly well done platforming game - there's great comedy, some drama, excellent pacing, and an excellent set of voicework and characters.
