Since we're on the topic of Royal Road, let me interest you in something I recently found. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced][Displaced]] follows the story of a number of humans in an isekai-like scenario, each starting in different parts of the fantasy world. They each have their own character traits, abilities, and environments that lead to vastly different plotlines (kinda GoT style) that will eventually slam into each other.

Why is this rational? I dare to say that all characters are Level 1 intelligent (using Yudkowsky's [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][definition]]) and we get inside their heads. There haven't been any inconsistencies that I've found (no 1000 miles in a day!).

Blake, the first character we follow, attempts operation:uplift, but he is slammed with the worst possible odds: a cultish religious nation. Suffice to say, the Author gives full credit to the difficulty of uplifting a nation and shows just how wrong it can go when you're not Mary Sue. The magical engineering is coherent for the most part, but the weak AI in the robots was a total handwave.

The Author is looking for criticism but doesn't have the time to make big changes (such as removing AI) to older chapters while he's writing the story. He intends to go back and change things at the end, but that could be years away. So small changes to past chapters in the form of suggestions are best, or criticism of recent chapters that can be acted upon handily. Eg. Blake made some unrealistic decisions in ch5, and the Author intends to change that in the near future.


** I'm having fun with this! I'm at chapter 21 and the series is pretty fun, though I'm not sure how rational, while I agree with the course of Blake's thoughts and generally with his direction, but quite a few of the events in those first few chapters was horribly convenient.

I can get over it though, and it makes enough sense after it is explained further. Artelle is an interesting character as well, though I'm honestly waiting in with baited breath for Blake and Sofie to meet.

Thanks for the recommendation, I needed something relatively light and entertaining as I just came from dropping the heaping pile of trash that is "Chaos seeds: the land" I got 4/7 volumes in before the authors writing style and the absolutely atrocious main character made it to bad to continue.

*** What were all the things in the early chapters that you found an issue with? I only found an issue with ch5, the rest seemed fine to me.

**** Blake has several very convenient things happen for him, the first being that he is a metal observer, thus letting him break free then he manages to get away despite running into Yarec, then he hides in a cave that just happens to be full of crystals and metal with names I won't even try to spell, then he learns about 'hyper mode' which I believe has something to do with his feeler abilities, though it has yet to really be explained, then he immediately replaces the arm he lost, then he beats 4 highly trained and specialised fighters in mortal combat with little to no injury.

All of these are kind of hard to believe, however they would be worse if Blake was the only main, he isn't, and later on quite a few of them are resolved, mostly the crystal and metal's presence, as It is explained they are everywhere.

The other problems don't bother me too much as it seems like Blake's role in the story isn't as a martial force but as a political and moral question, is it right to force people to do things that you know will be ultimately beneficial for them against their will? Possibly. Is what he is doing to Samanta right? Almost definitely not.

This is why I say that I'm mostly gone with those early problems I had, as they don't really matter after Blake's position in the story is established.

I'm just as interested in the other two who seem to be adapting to this world much more poorly, though they have themes and questions of their own to explain them.

** So, after reading this post, I went and checked out this series. I like it! I'm just around 15 chapters in, and it's pretty fun. Its a relatively light read, though. Given the situation, I was hoping for more high-level politics

*** There are more politics later, though I'm not sure how high-level it is.

*** It's currently at 47 chapters which measure ~1000 pages by RoyalRoad's metric. It updates a chapter once every 1 or 2 weeks. +I don't know how pages convert to words, sorry.+

Edit: A page is 275 words, so it's at about 275000 words so far.
