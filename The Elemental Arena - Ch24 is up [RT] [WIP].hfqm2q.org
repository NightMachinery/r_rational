** Elemental Arena thoughts! Long post incoming:

​

1. So help me you mouth breathers if you don't have a leader by morning I will climb into your imaginary world and whine at you myself. You are all smart people! You have just had the delightful experience of literally trying to decide on a plan while under fire. Learn from this. Every human organization that accomplishes anything is a hierarchy. Make one. A bad plan now beats yada yada. 7 billion lives are on the line, and you are letting each person individually try and guess what the best build is? Nate has to ask around to find out what synthesis results so far are? The mind reels. Shape up!
2. The night time hours, when you are guaranteed that no monsters will attack, strike me as super precious (assuming tonight works like last night, natch). Splitting up at any other time increases the total number of monsters incoming, but as long as you don't stumble on one of their miniboss dungeons it should be possible to travel in relative safety right now. Depends on how far away they are, of course, but I think losing 1-2 hours of sleep for the gang would be worth it if in exchange you were able to link up with a larger team.
3. Once the day starts and the monster attacks begin again...it may not be optimal to keep absolutely every one together. I expect that's what's up with those 3 at the other camp. You get more exp the fewer of you that there are, so I imagine you want something like a camp with all the noncombat people and a few combat folks to manage the hourlies and make sure all the crafters get their chance to contribute. Then, separately from that, you want as many small teams of combat specs as you can get away with each getting their own spawn and hoovering up experience. Collapse as important encounters or other player signs are sighted.
4. As far as skills go...my only real thought here is that the end of day battle made it seem to me like melee combat is just about over with. They did a number on the frogs and guths alike with their bows, and if they'd had all 3 of them I think the boss fight would have been a walkover. The frogs are sentient, no chance they don't adopt missile techniques (their jumping mobility and that terrifying stealth stuff will make their archers pure hell), and I bet the guths start getting archers as well. If I were in the team's shoes I'd prioritize defense and ranged techniques, in particular the hope is to learn a technique that blocks ranged attacks, so you don't end up in the frog's shoes, like 'look an arrow just sprouted from one of our guy's eyes.'
5. As far as the Languages thing goes, I doubt we'll get much love from the captured frog. Ultimately the frogs are in our boat, right? Only humanity or their kind can persist, zero sum game. Any cooperation we managed would be in the shadow of both sides expecting the other to betray them, and thus incented to strike first. I do like the idea, however, of using the game system's language to try and speak with the Guths and other monsters who are just free roaming, not spawned to attack in the hourly rushes. They showed emotion in the battle, so they may be sentient, and they aren't trapped in the same 'one of our species will persist' bind that we and the frogs are. Even them just gossiping about the system could be crucial.

Anyway, very glad to see that this is updating again. Thanks to the author!

*** Regarding item #5: I've been wracking my brain trying to think of why Maya would think she'd have any traction at all with rival players. None of this sounds very convincing to me, but here goes:

- A ceasefire might work for a day or two if a rival species is already in active conflict with a bigger threat.

- Post-Arena concessions to a species /might/ lay groundwork for more robust cooperation. The contestants are slated to rule their species if they win.

- Pre-existing rivalries or enmities may open the door as well. If a species or two is absolutely hated, others may cooperate to make sure they don't win.

- Even if diplomacy fails, learning another species' language would allow you to read the wristband interface of captives. If you luck out and capture one with /Maps/ skill, you immediately get access to the number and disposition of that entire species. An enemy with Nathan's skills would provide /Equipment Fusion/ recipes and /Compendium/ entries. Any enemy will have their entire log stored, which would allow discovery of additional skills, especially those unlocked by player action.

This last opportunity makes a lot of tactical sense, but is difficult to write in a way that keeps a reader engaged. It'd boil down to making a player use a skill to the detriment of their team, which seems to be contrary to the spirit of gaining a skill.

**** Okay, I /think/ I can see what Maya's up to. Here's a quote from the Guide early in the story (most relevant in *bold*):

#+begin_quote
  /[The main arena trials have begun. There are a total of three phases. The objective for passing phase one is for your species to defeat the third floor dungeon boss in your starter zone 14. You are limited to five day and night cycles for your species to complete the task, thus unlocking access to other zones in region 4 and beginning phase two. *All species in your starter zone who fail to meet the objective within the time limit will be terminated.*]/
#+end_quote

Maya has noted that /Group Leader I/ skill shares kill credit among all members of a group. She wants to recruit other species to form groups with humans so that all participating species get kill credit and can advance. If a multi-species group takes down the dungeon boss, the cooperative - with all participating species - can win.

***** These were my thoughts exactly. Nowhere in the given rules did i remember reading that only a single species was able to pass. I dont know why everybody started latching onto that so quickly; it could very easily have ended up screwing over the entire human effort to pass the trials. Weve seem that kill credit is awarded for participating in a battle. No reason all species in the zone cant accomplish that together.

** /Synthesis/ opens up a lot of possibilities.

- I'd like to see Iliya combine /Monster Harvesting I/ and /Thrust I/ to make her an efficient harvester of bear meat. While this sounds silly, food has been enormously limiting for Team Humanity. Eliminating gathering time means more time to travel or pursue other important goals.

- Emma may gain a greatly enhanced healing skill by fusing /Advanced Healing I/ and /First Aid I/. Doing so is likely to result in a skill too costly to use, however. Another option would be to combine /Advanced Healing I/ with /Water Mastery I/ to focus the skill enhancement exclusively into a more powerful and less costly healing power. Emma is not known to have /Water Mastery I/, but she has a strong Mental stat, and is very likely to have it unlocked.

What ideas do you all have for unique skill combos? For reference, here's the [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Skill][Skill List]] and the [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Character][Character List]].
