** Congratulations, EagleJarl!

You managed to survive up to today, despite the untold number of dangers you, undoubtedly, face every day. From the tiny germs of disease to the Sol's massive might, you have avoided them all due to some luck and a little prudence.

You have dealt with the crazed and deranged members of our society even as you strove to better see through the madness all for the effort to choose, not the right path, but the */optimal/* path.

Sure, your body is a little older and your mind is a little wiser (hopefully!) than the one you had last year. But that just means you have endured and shrugged off what the world had thrown at you over the last 12 months.

You are one badass for lasting up to now.

Think you're up for another year?

Most definitely. During which you will continue to get weekly drops of my writing. Especially now that I'm taking a shot at going full-time with it. :>

As to being older...when I was 10, birthdays were excellent. At 20 they were fine (although 25 was hard for some reason). From 30-35 they were ok. From 36-40 they were less than good. Now, at 44, they are ok again. Here's hoping they stay that way.

** Thank you all, this is really nice of you.

Out of curiosity, where did you find out that it was my birthday? I didn't think it was in my profile either here or on FFN.
