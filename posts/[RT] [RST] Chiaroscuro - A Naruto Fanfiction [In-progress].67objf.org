What if Shikamaru was born with his father's intellect /and/ his mother's work ethic? Well, that's basically what's being answered in this fic.

It's pretty damn intelligent. The subterfuge, clever application of abilities and quite a few other things that I can't put my finger on clearly makes this fic head and shoulders above most Naruto fics that I've read, with clear exception to Need to Become Stornger.


** Seconded. I believe this story has been mentioned in passing here on this sub, but no one appears to have made an actual post about it--a fact which is somewhat surprising, given its quality. I was actually considering making a post on it myself, but never quite got around to it. Kudos to you, OP.

P.S. I'm not sure if I'm misremembering, but I believe the author of the story has also commented on this sub in the past. If so, he's at least a peripheral member of the community.

** I agree that this story is a rationalist work but, based on the fourteen chapters I've read, it's not very well written. It's clear that the author is trying but it doesn't come off very well. Still a somewhat enjoyable story but it doesn't really compare to most of the works we've seen on this sub. It also pales in comparison to a lot of other good Naruto fanfic.

That being said, it's still a decent story and my opinion is my own.

*** It gets a lot better further in. Could you specify on how its poorly written in your eyes? I thought it was perfectly serviceable, though I can usually slog through most poorly written things if the dialogue is well written enough and I'm interested in the story, so my opinion might be jaded.

**** I've given up at about chapter 21 or so, so I can't really speak for the "further in" you mentioned, I suppose.

*Also, there be spoilers up to chapter 21 ahead, so tread carefully.*

And it's definitely "serviceable". But I find that most of the stories that end up posted here are written to a much higher standard than serviceable, so I may also be biased.

Firstly, there's not a whole lot of description. While the fight scenes are somewhat entertaining, due to the intelligent spin Shikamaru puts on things, they feel very bland. Even the segment with Orochimaru just felt blase and boring.

Secondly, it also seems really inconsistent to me in general; for example, why is everyone so certain Orochimaru can come back from the dead? He's never established that ability at this point (it's established in canon much /much/ later but never in this part of the story or canon so far) He also gets crippled /very/ trivially. We've seen Orochimaru demonstrate monstrous healing abilities mid fight, and we've also seen that everyone's terrified he'll resurrect himself, we also know he must be a God at the Kawarimi yet electrocution makes his arms useless? Due to muscle spasms? It felt very much like the author just needed his arms to be not working as an excuse for what comes later.

And with Shikamaru gaining Izumo as an ally in chapter 20, that felt implausible in several ways; he basically promised him a /Jonin/ position in exchange for a B rank? Even with the implied caveat that this would only happen if Izumo was skilled enough, this seems implausible both because Izumo has no reason to believe Shikamaru could get this done (your son telling you about this random guy he thinks should be a Jonin isn't the strongest recommendation) and because he'd be giving a group of (highly skilled, but still) genin he knows /nothing/ about a mission reserved for experienced Chunin. Shikamaru knows nothing about Izumo either. They basically both operated on blind faith, which is dumb from both of their ends and seems unlikely in the more sane Naruto world the author's trying to present to us. It felt contrived and completely driven by the plot. As an author, it's your job to do your best to NOT make that so obvious.

Thirdly, the story doesn't feel like it delivers very well on what it promises, that of Shikamaru being some borderline OP prodigy level ninja. It's heavily implied that he's holding back and that he works with almost Gai-level persistence to hone his skills, yet he still feels lackluster. The way he's talked about, he should be sweeping the board (with obvious exception to people like Kakashi and Orochimaru) but there hasn't been anything like that. At least not yet. And it's all well and good to hold yourself back in context of the world he lives in but, from a story perspective, waiting twenty chapters for you to deliver on the implied promise of a Shikamaru much better than canon is a bit too much. There's too much /telling/ that Shikamaru's crazy good and not nearly enough /showing/ of it. Honestly, I can't really think of a single moment in the chapters I've read where canon Shikamaru wouldn't have done the job just as well as this Shikamaru, outside of being the top student in the academy.

Lastly, this one particular part of the story was absolutely cringy and automatically made me immediately dock points from the author in my mind. It happens at the end of chapter 15.

#+begin_quote
  There was really only one proper diagnosis for what he'd just seen.

  "He's dying."
#+end_quote

*Chapter 15 ends*

*Chapter 16 begins*

#+begin_quote
  Hiruzen Sarutobi's heart nearly stopped right then and there.

  "What did you say?"

  "He's dying," Jiraiya confirmed with finality as he got to work immediately. The curse seal lines were mere inches away from Kakashi's heart. If he had arrived even thirty minutes later, it would have been too late.

  "But he's not dead yet. I think I can save him. Well, more like, buy him a few more decades."

  "Oh. All right, then."
#+end_quote

Capitful Fuck and Off. That was a move that felt as close to clickbait as you could really get in a written work. At the end of chapter 15, we get about half a page to a page's worth of build up and reasoning to why Kakashi won't make it. There's at least three seperate issues and hints, followed by the chapter ending with Jiraiya saying "he's dying.". I thought to myself 'Wow, he's killing Kakashi? Bold move' because he'd set up Kakashi's death /to make sense/. It could've been a powerful moment; a moving moment for the team and a shake up to the classic Naruto formula that would've served to drive our main team seven even further. Instead we get typical, tropey bullshit that didn't even have the decency to be done in a cool or interesting way. That was the final nail in this story's coffin for me, such that I was completely unsurprised when I finished chapter twent one and said to myself "Yea, I'm done with you."

So overall, that's why I said what I said. The story certainly is fine. But it's just that; fine. I could've continued on on a few other tangents but I didn't want to descend into pointless bashing. It's fine if others feel differently from I do though that doesn't necessarily invalidate some of what I said. The story has legitimate issues.

***** Its definitely flawed, I'll give you that. Your comparison of show don't tell and Kakashi's "death" are spot on, it even gets a bit worse later on in the whole Jonin promotion thing. A lot of the story has some very good moments, but they're usually immediately spoiled by bad ones. If you don't mind a few minor spoilers, at around chapter 23 Shikkamaru decides to contact Anko and make a deal, essentially feeding her ideas that she'd reveal to the sect hunting down Orochimaru, but the main idea that he initially feeds her is... extremely obvious.

There's some moments like that later on as well, but... I liked it. I certainly see someone disliking it, but certain moments stuck out to me. I enjoyed the subplots going on, and the character's were engaging. Overall I gave it a pass, but I certainly don't blame you for not.

Maybe my memories of a separate but far better fic where Naruto goes on team 10 instead of Choji are coloring me. It isn't a rational fic, but its action scenes are written phenomenally and the character interactions were also very entertaining. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6557238/1/Better-Left-Unsaid][Better Left Unsaid]] if you're interested.

Ah....in my original comment, I said there was a lot of Naruto fanfic that stood far above this one. And BLU is definitely one of them. I've been a fan of this author for *years*. He's definitely slowed down recently but I still really enjoy his content. I've read most of his work, my favorite being his Naruto/Street Fighter fic (A crossover he somehow makes really work, even though it's mostly in the SF world!). I agree that it's really good :)

******** That's a big question; after all I've been reading Naruto fanfic since 2007 or so. But I shall try and rummage through my brain to throw out some highlights:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3977593/1/Two-Halves][Two Halves]] - Honorable mention as the first fanfic I ever read period. It's mostly just a NaruHina slowburn romance story though. Cutesy, not ground breaking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3430516/1/Lost-soul][Lost Soul]] was a good one that I read from almost its inception up to its completion. It's one of those "Naruto is trained into a living weapon" type fics. In fact, it may have been one of the first of that particular genre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8116183/1/Ghost][Ghost]] was also pretty good; it's another one of those "Naruto is trained into a weapon" fics but the difference is in the way it's done; Ghost!Naruto is more of a combat pragmatist than anything else. He wears gray, rarely speaks and is more comfortable with shooting someone in the dark with a crossbow instead of having an out-and-out jutsu fight.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10996503/1/Of-the-River-and-the-Sea][Of the River and the Sea]] was one of the best Naruto fanfictions I've ever read; hands down. The fact that it does this while focusing almost entirely on an SI OC reborn in Kiri in a time that mostly predates canon makes that even more impressive. It feels sort of rational in that the main character is an intelligent SI from our world who's well versed in things like economics and survivalist tactics. She's also likable in general, and lovably insane (at least to me). *Highly recommend this one!*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11418526/1/Kill-Your-Heroes][Kill Your Heroes]] is another very good one. It's Sakura focused and written from an intelligent, realistically gritty standpoint. One of my favorite parts from it is when an old, retired kunoichi bitches about the 4th Hokage because he was dumb enough to get Konoha's jinchuuriki pregnant. /"The worst story," Gozen-san said at last, "is of a selfish man for whom many sons and daughters died, just so he could have a son of his own blood. He knew exactly the stress it would put on the seal, but he did it anyway, because he was so strong and proud and clever that he thought that it was his chance to take. But it wasn't, not in the end. So many dead, all because one man didn't have the sense to adopt and raise a child of the heart, rather than of the flesh. And he died for it, but did anyone think he'd gotten exactly what he'd deserved?"...."No," she said softly, voice sharper than one of Sakura's knives. "No. They whitewashed him and what he'd done and made him a hero," she sneered. "And that is why it's the worst story."/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4041754/1/Time-and-Again][Time and Again]] is a pretty good time travel fic; it's long and complete BUT it does have an unfinished sequel that starts where Shippuden does basically.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4512691/1/Medicinal-Lullaby][Medicinal Lullaby]] is another amazing Naruto fanfic. This one is Naruto as a dad. At sixteen. Yuppppp. Sadly, it's unfinished so far but what IS there is really, really good. The Naruto in it becomes strong, like OP-broken-plz-nerf strong. But that doesn't make parenthood any easier. It feels like a very realistic portrayal of parenthood by a young guy with no experience but all of the determination and good intentions in the world. Highly recommend this one as well.

I'm going to assume you've read Time Braid.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2348553/1/The-Legend-of-Uzumaki-Naruto-A-Beginning][The Legend of Uzumaki Naruto]] was a story I really enjoyed as a kid; it's a Naruto/World of Warcraft crossover but you really don't need to know anything about WoW to enjoy it (I didn't know shit about WoW when I first read it). Again it's complete and has a sequel but the sequel appears to be discontinued. Regardless, the original story is about 600k words, has its own complete narrative, and was a very fun read.

There's definitely a lot more in my brain but those are all I can come up with right now. Enjoy! :)

I've only checked the first chapter of the story - the opening is well done in the sense that it immediately shows the reader what's different from canon and what to expect, but after that it descends into the usual "I AM SO ANGRY I SPEAK IN ALL CAPS" tell instead of show pitfall. Could still be a good story but that sort of thing throws me off pretty quickly.
