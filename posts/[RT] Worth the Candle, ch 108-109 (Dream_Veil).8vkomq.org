** I cannot believe I didn't see the Dream Skewering being fake coming. The Actual Cannibal would have killed any collection of earth folk from his time long ago, and the implication was there were dozens or hundreds of them.

Also, Arthur is going to be hacked off when he finds out Juniper has no interest in going back to Earth.

*** We didn't know that the dream skewered were from 2017, only that they were from Earth. And then most people aren't from North America/Europe, where Shia Labeouf is popular. So only a tiny fraction would even know the name, much less mention a somewhat popular actor when there is little reason for his name to come up.

Although this raises the question I asked last update of how the knowledge of Shia Labeouf got passed on at all, if the people who say it are murdered. How could it happen that the syllables are not only put together correctly randomly, but the name is passed on through some obscure method that is the only one that works?

The only thing I thought of was using elf luck in some fashion, because it can give the elf information that they otherwise shouldn't be able to know. Someone is about to say the name, and a nearby elf shoots their hand out to stop them? Kinda implausible.

***** He likely follows the rules for the game. Meaning when fighting Shia, you have to cause him injury in a number of isolated events a number of times equal to 5 + 5n, where N is the number of people in the initial group, then an additional 5 for every single person he kills. Given that if the rules are followed, each injury you take lowers your success chance for harming him by 16%, and you have a flat 16% failure rate to start. The only way to escape would be to leave the location, which is difficult given that if you go five minutes in safety, he can bend reality to attack you.

**** We know Amaryllis learned it from a machine that was endlessly repeating it, safe because 'everyone involved' was long since dead. The people who set that up probably heard the name when someone else said it and they were lucky enough (40% chance for a single utterance) that the cannibal didn't show up.

Repeat going back until you find yourself asking how people found out the infohazard in the first place. They didn't know it was a name, which rules out a few possible origins, but it could be that someone wrote it down, then died, and then someone read it, took it home, said it, and died. From there it isn't hard to see how people could figure out what was going on, after enough trial and error.

There was moderate evidence that there was no dream-skewered from after World War II, hence the lack of electronics, or that nobody before Joon noticed that the world they were in seemed pretty similar to Tolkien-inspired fantasy.

But there could have been a collection of dream-skewered from all over Earth, from different time periods. In fact, it would have been more surprising if all dream-skewered had come from the same country and time.

Especially since Uther's works would be the only ones that would pop up as almost direct equivalents.

(eg Star Wars being written in an era full of pulp science-fiction movies and stories)

If nothing else, the "Star Wars"-"dream skewered" connection would be better known.

I feel like contrasting Uther's narrative focus to Joon's decision to let go of the narrative's weight might be a clue into the nature of the "game." Uther may have been playing with the wrong strategy, so to say, because fixing Aerb's issues was never the intended end-game for Arthur (whereas it might be for Joon, who has a reason to undo all the suffering he helped create).

I've had a theory that this game is a type of therapy. So if we work with the conceit that Arthur was sent here for some therapeutic reason, what issues did Arthur have? The only things I remember are: (1) he was the god of stories without endings and in the same vein (2) he always waffled and deferred confessing to Tiff. So maybe his issue was that he couldn't commit to an ending and the narrative kept being deferred because he went every which way.

The way I read the DM he has already set up the challenge and made sure that Joon has the opportunity to acquire the tools he needs to face it. I think the DM might be tweaking things a bit to keep things interesting but only to the point of maintaining plausible deniability to any hypothetical observers, but I think any big events which will occur to challenge Joon have already been set underway, and will happen regardless of whether Joon survives up until that point or not.

One observation in favour of this is that after Uther disappeared, the threats continued coming for another 30 years, rather than stopping abruptly. Another is that the way the DM has set up Joon's harem is consistent with this approach to DMing, he set up the possibility in advance, but since Joon persistently acted in defiance of the path layed out for him, it didn't happen.

I don't think that Joon is here because of the rising threat or that the threats are appearing because of Joon, rather they have a common cause (The DM wanted to run another campaign).

** There's no bigger threat.

We have little reason to believe anything past the second keyring actually happened. That outcome was pretty convenient for Masters: Juniper's allies have left, and Masters is now alone with him, up against an enormous threat. Any bets on them striking an alliance of convenience next chapter, during which they would come to trust each other?

Elf luck was compromised. Masters likely could take control of any sense if he knows it is relevant, and he figured out elf luck even before becoming hostile. Scaring them into leaving, then fooling everyone sans Juniper into thinking that Juniper is visibly leaving with them, was entirely doable.

They screwed up their identity confirmations, should've been continuously exchanging private information, inserting it in phrases and such. Faking that would've been next to impossible.

(I'm not sure what's up with Valencia, though. If Masters couldn't affect her and she was fine, she wouldn't have left with the rest of the party, since she would've seen Juniper not leaving. I'd bet on her being incapacitated in the room, then taken through the portal by the rest of the party. Would explain why no-one else hesitated to leave her behind, and why Masters expected only Juniper to stay.)

*** Mhh... I don't know. There was definitely some shenanigans happening after the second keyring (I'm pretty sure Amaryllis didn't /really/ suggest they give him info), but I think there was a real external threat that somehow incapacitated Masters at the end of the chapter.

Let's see... Juniper has access to soul vision, which I'm pretty sure Masters can't fake, which means all their movements definitely matched what we saw. So the illusion was auditory and /maybe/ elf luck at most. There was definitely a portal, the others went through it, Joon didn't. Given that info, it's likely Valencia didn't go either (else she'd have dragged Joon with her), which means she's trapped somewhere.

I think the part at the end really is the illusion cutting off. Maybe it wasn't, and Masters cut himself off mid-sentence on purpose... but I don't think he's /that/ good. He's confused, he's dealing with what he thinks is Uther 2.0 and his new Knights, Joon has shown an ability to see through some of his illusions, and Masters doesn't know how the ability works and what its limits are. The scene really makes sense if you assume Masters is grasping at straws there (unlike Fallatehr, who was smooth and deliberate even after he was exposed).

I'm calling it now, this is what happened:

- Masters cut off most of his illusions when Joon touched his friends.

- He tried to convince them to stay, by man-in-the-middle-ing their dialogue.

- He was taken out, either by Valencia, or by an external force.

- Everyone except Joon decided to leave, for the reasons we saw.

**** I am pretty sure that elf luck was compromised.

First of all, from Masters' perspective, it was the best sense to attack. Juniper has shown some unexpected ability to see through the illusions, with no exact limit. That meant Masters' ability to fool him /or/ the rest of the part became limited: Juniper would have seen through the illusions, and if Masters targeted his teammates, Juniper would have seen them reacting to illusions. That was true for every sense, /except/ elf luck.

Fenn had elf luck, but Juniper didn't (as far as Masters knew). That meant Juniper wouldn't have been able to see through illusions targeting elf luck. That was the state of the situation --- and then Fenn's sense of danger overloaded.

Is that not suspicious?

Second: circumstantial evidence/the timeline.

--------------

To recap, Masters likely could compromise any sense if he knows to target it. He knew that Fenn had luck sense, but had no reason to think that about Juniper. Juniper's luck sense was enough to pick up on what Fenn's luck sense registered as "a little tingle", but then he didn't feel anything at all while Fenn was experiencing sense overload.

As I said, I'm pretty sure elf luck was compromised. Given that, what is the likelihood that some kind of external threat /really/ arrive when Masters was faking the arrival of an external threat?

If your goal is to get some ‘alone time' with Joon then I don't think this plan works nine times out of ten.

Say she is lying unconscious in the middle of the room. He could show her to the rest of the party, but continue blocking Juniper's perception of her. They grab her and put her through the portal --- and now they don't have any reason to hesitate escaping, unlike Juniper. Masters creates an illusion of Juniper walking through the portal, replaces actual Juniper with Masters' image, for Amaryllis to talk to at the end, and sees everyone except Juniper leave.

(We don't even know if the portal is actually closed, by the way. Perhaps Masters used an illusion to "close" it faster?)

However, on second thoughts, it's conditional on Masters knowing/gambling on Juniper's inability to see her, which means he would be able to figure out soul sight, which means he would be able to fake it, which means he has absolute control again and no reason to scare them off.

I'm going back and forth but I think this is correct. I couldn't find a single statement from Master that appears to be false. He says "It's not me."

*** My preferred state (most interesting narrative) would be if our party happens to be equipped with radios / walky-talkies (afaik, these exist on aerb).

Now, they would be in a very interesting position: Communications Joon-> party cannot be interfered with, but comms party->joon can be modified. Masters can listen to everything.

Now we need a protocol for peaceful (almost neutral ground) negotiations. First, joon will repeat back everything he hears, both from party and from M; the latter is necessary because M is presumably not physically speaking at all. In other words, the party can catch all deceptions. In regular intervalse, and especially before every irreversible decision (e.g. revealing new info to M), Joon queries the party whether any deceptions occurred: If they spotted deceptions, tell e.g. the last name of Harry Potter's male companion; if they spotted no deceptions, tell the last name of his female companion.

M is informed of this protocol. He is informed that negotiations will end if he fakes any communications. If he must interfere, he is to replace by [redacted], which would be considered shitty but less hostile than replacement by lies.

Ultimately, Joon has no way of fighting. If M has any sense, the room is rigged to collapse into a lava pit, and J cannot quickly find the exit anyway. If joon finds val, and she is presumed immune to illusion, then the same protocol applies.

*** Except Masters doesn't know the team well enough to create an illusion of them acting in character. That's why he had them just standing around being puzzled like Joon was.

Most telling is Mary's comment about voting at the end. I doubt Uther was running his group as a democracy, based both on him being king and from what we've heard about his actions in Aerb. And Aerb doesn't have a democratic tradition that it would make sense for him to make that guess.

So, it seems like the team Joon thought he was interacting with was really them. And we know they really left because he couldn't have known to fake the solo mode achievement. (We also know Valencia is incapacitated or elsewhere, for the same reason.)

It's possible he faked the luck sense that Fenn felt, but I can't see how he could have been sure enough that Joon was going to stay behind, which was his most pressing concern at the time, if we assume no outside threat.

It is possible he noticed Fenn's reference to Joon having luck (bad opsec there), and he may have suppressed Joon's sense at the end in the hopes he would stay. But none of the rest of the possibilities seem reasonable given what we know of Masters's capabilities.

It's very believable that someone would notice that, and the fact that the threats petered off after Arthur left, and be very leery of a successor popping up and starting the cycle again.

Honestly, he might be doing the world a favor by killing Joon. The DM has promised that he won't railroad Joon, but Masters doesn't know that, and the DM has already shown just staying idle isn't really an option for him.

On another note, he mentioned he wasn't sure if Arthur could lose, and noted that despite winning every time, and talking about fate and narratives, he nonetheless /always/ seemed to give situations his all. Maybe his low-key demand for information was an attempt to bypass whatever factor let the chosen one always win, by making Joon not try very hard to escape?

**** Thanks. I'd agree that AO3 is a much harsher audience. It also tends to be harsh in a way that this subreddit rarely is; it's pretty typical for people on AO3 (at least for this work) to comment about "the author" as though they have a clue who I am or why I made the writing choices I did. That's not really a way that I tend to engage with works, nor is it a way that I like seeing others engage with works (even those I didn't write), nor do I think it's terribly productive unless there's a strong case to be made one way or another, like from biographical details (and even then). Judging the internal mental state of other people is very hard, all the more so when you're looking at something they created rather than speaking with them directly.

I tend to approach AO3 comments in batches, and then skip past the stuff that doesn't look like it's going to be something that I would want to respond to. Sometimes there are corrections or clarifications I want to give, sometimes there's actual discussion, and sometimes (rarely) there are typos. I went through a period of just ignoring comments entirely, but I've been trying to get better about A) dealing with negative feedback in a way that's mentally and creatively healthy and B) giving people responses that I think can enhance the work. I've had some success with it so far.

- Val is an out of context problem between her immunity to most magic/poison/conventional weapons and her martial prowess. To take her down you'd need to prepare a specific counter before hand, (or be lucky enough to have something on hand, which is possible with access to Uther's vault)

- Master seemed to be trying to avoid harming Joon's companions since he potentially valued Joon's cooperation, further complicating any attempt to take down Val.

- What ever Master potentially had set up which could have dealt with Val, would also have to also be ineffective at preventing the deaf and blind party from escaping.

This leaves two possibilities, Val left voluntarily (possibly to chase Master), or she didn't leave the room until Solace opened the portal (I don't think she's invisible next to Joon since that seems like it would prevent Joon from getting the achievement).

** Did someone say they miss the paranoia from the Fallatehr arc?

I'd bet a gram of gold that that achievement was a bit of sly DM trickery and Joon isn't really /alone/ except in the narrative sense since only he can break the illusion. I'm working off the suspicion that Masters figured out Joon's soul sight (or simply applied the illusion on every level he knows) because it seemed unlikely that Solace suddenly pulled portal-making out of her rump when she previously mentioned a tree and Masters questioned it.

If true, this suggests illusionism and social fu (ability to imitate voices convincingly) is a frightening combo. Depending on how fast Masters can process different people talking in real-time and falsify a version more fitting for his purposes, you'd be completely unable to follow the true conversation, especially if he's letting in-character "real" responses slip through to muddy the waters. Going over the conversation (if my theory's true), there's quite a few lines near the end that could've been fudged before everyone got the illusion of Solace making a portal and Joon "saw" his party jumping through. Masters might be powerful enough to create an entire scene in his exclusion zone (which now that I think about it, might be why he had no choice but to do Uther's bidding after 20 years).

** Some random thoughts:

- Joon didn't mention seeing anyone else's soul in the room with him. First thoughts - a non-anima illusionist? or he's really far away? Or he's fooling soulsight? Or he's actually a sentient entad a la Bethel? Or something else entirely is going on?

- The illusionist claims to be named Masters. Clearly this is a Worm reference, because the illusionist is a Master 12.

- We don't know the illusionist's real name, gender, appearance, or anything else, at any level we might consider absolutely certain. They probably doesn't have any assistants or anyone else in the building. They might be pretending to be trained that monastic discipline in order to make faking facial expressions easier - if they have trouble responding accurately by simulating facial expressions in real-time.

- Speaking of that monastic order, they are Worth The Candle's Dûnyain, and nothing they could tell me, with their iron-clad control of their faces, would convince me otherwise.

- Val saving the day would be awesome, she needs to save the day more, she hasn't really yet saved the day nearly as much as I'd like.

- Joon has a limited amount of soulsight time left. Looking for unidentified souls and seeking methods whereby he can end them might work. Some of his gem-based blasting magic, perhaps? I don't even know.

Overall, the plot twist with regard to dream skewered here was great, 10/10. And the illusionist battle looks like it'll be a great mindscrew, so I look forward to that. His opponent controls the vertical and the horizontal, but he still has a few tricks to play.

*** I think Master figured out Joon was using soul sight, because he couldn't see Val and the Master correctly identified what Val was. One way out is if Joon can gain access to illusion magic he might be able to level up fast enough to start seeing through the illusions.

But this might be a challenge Joon is not meant to defeat. It happens in DMing. Joon got this quest at L2 when he would have had zero chance.

** Hey long time listener first time caller, quick question, has there been any discussion in the past about how weird it is that the world contains elements that Joon invented after Arthur's death, like Fel Seed? My assumption was always that the world was built at some point from Joon's work, and then Arthur was brought in at some point and then later Joon was brought in, and the DM guides them around. But Fel Seed indicates that there are major elements that were still being added to the world in between Arthur's and Joon's transits, assuming Arthur entered before his death.

Anyway, w/r/t this chapter, I'm super happy to see someone dealing with illusion magic in DnD as the game-breaking power that it is, and tying it strictly to the I/O channels for the brain. It reminds of imachination, and I was always really happy with how that turned out. Great chapter, great story.

It requires shenanigans with the passage of time, but we already know that those happened given the much longer time gap on Aerb than on Earth.

If so, a lot of the nonstop shit that Arthur had to deal with was drawn from Joon's campaigns during his self-destructive period, and Joon is (unintentionally) responsible for a lot of Arthur's decline.

this world is probably a simulation, meaning joon and arthur could just be simulated recreations of their earth minds and bodies. any reason to think this isn't happening thousands or billions of years post arthur's death?

Him being just a brainscan of Joon is pretty easily plausible - even if he was 'transported' it's probably still a copy kinda in the same sense as a Star Trek transporter actually making copies and just killing the original. To put someone's mind into another person you'd have to copy the first person's brain and place it on the second's. Then whether or not it's being 'teleported' or just 'copied' is if you decide to kill/delete the original copy afterwards.

  The Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny was one of the smaller athenaeums, which meant that it ‘only' had a hundred thousand students, divided up into a handful of colleges. It was a hell of a lot of people even before you added in all the faculty and staff, all of them packed onto the tip of the mountain.
#+end_quote

Do you think the colleges are all on the mountain, or spread out in different countries? If it's the first, that's a lot of power to give the kingdom that hosts each Athenaum, and would make it harder for farther flung nations to send people for training.

The latter would make more sense, but would make each individual Athenaeum less impressive from a narrative standpoint.

On another note, Joon staying behind alone to save Valencia is likely to skyrocket her loyalty even further, especially with how easily it rises for her. I'm guessing we'll see an example of loyalty level 30 soon.

#+end_quote

This is alluded to in ch 37:

#+begin_quote
  This was then backed up by the athenaeums wielding their power against the various polities of the empire when they tried to defect from ‘sensible' intellectual property laws and/or certification schemes. Most of the athenaeums had scholarships and departments devoted to placement of their students, which meant that there was a carrot labeled ‘we'll pay your young people to come here' and a stick labeled ‘we won't send you graduated mages', but with a lather of diplomacy on top of that basic reality. On top of that, most of the athenaeums were filthy rich and nearly nations in their own right, which meant that they could (and did) use all of the standard tactics that corporations used on Earth, like pumping money into politics, having people write editorials complaining about a politician or policy, filing lawsuits, or doing other things like that.
#+end_quote

Essentially, travel (and in some cases, tuition) is often paid for by the athenaeums as a way of leveling the playing field and giving greater justification for why they should remain the primary places of learning for their particular field.

The relationship between an athenaeum and a kingdom is often more like that of a giant factory and a small town; the factory is good for the town, but it's also got much more muscle than the town does, and their relationship can sometimes be a little on the abusive side ... if it's not just a case of the athenaeum being the one in direct control of the kingdom.

** I'm a little sad we didn't get to see and probably will never see ACTUAL CANNIBAL SHIA LEBEOUF in Aerb. I mean, when Masters started listing off actors, I did not know why but I thought it might be back on! Then, nope, 180^{^{o}} to a similarly satisfying plot-related turn of events.

I'd love to see some in-universe horror-comedy mix, and I have a feeling our beloved author would pull it off well.

Maybe the cannibal could make an appearance in an April Fools chapter or something of the sort?

i mean of course hes the villain, but...still. i wanted them to be best bros, or for uther to be party member #7, but...no...he thinks aerb is fake and thus worthless (ignoring the compatibility of the virtual and the real) and either is going to be an antagonist on aerb, or made a deal with the dm (who im like 90% sure is straight up alexander wales) to switch places with juniper.

and i mean arthur's had centuries to think about all this stuff so itll be all too easy to convince joon, and itll be all to easy for him to be so set in his thinking that joon could never ever convince him

** I think Joon's behavior was extremely idiotic in 109. He was just too hostile and wary. He didn't consider first wat Masters even wanted - he only spoke to escape, not actually exchange information. On the other hand, despite all that wariness, he only thought about defeating/escaping the centuries-old extremely powerful wizard within his own exclusion zone, instead of, you know, negotiating his way out. And he didn't consider what this meeting - his first meeting with a person who personally knew Uther - means from the narrative point of view.

*** Because separating him from his companions and trapping him inside a room using Illusions, not to mention mimicking those companions to parrot favorable opinions, isn't hostile action? The man obviously sees Joon's very existence as a possible threat to the world, and he isn't entirely wrong, but he should have stated his point /before/ using hostile forbidden magic against a wary individual who just came to help.

**** Absolutism is a very dangerous thought pattern. Yes, those were hostile, but to what degree? Master's aim was, quite obviously, information. None of his hostilities were lethal or even damaging (unlike those of Joon). Put yourself in the shoes of someone who carried a task he didn't even fully understand for half a millenia, and all his actions become quite reasonable, if a bit excessive.

***** I agree, I am mostly speaking as Devil's advocate, I also dislike the way that Masters went about it, he didn't act like a man seeking information on a long and arduous job, he separated them and ambushed them with incomprehensible and unknown magic, using it to deceive and disorient them to make them more malleable to his demands. Almost no one in this series ever tries the carrot before the stick, and Masters is definitely usinging the stick here lethal or not.

** I am so excited for solo mode! I think this is just the thing this story has needed for some time now . I don't think Arthur had gamer powers similar to Juniper's, he could just learn stuff 140 times faster?( That would be a rough estimate given the information that he could learn a new language in a day), also, when Juniper managed to break the illusion with soul sight Masters didn't understand how he managed it given that he couldn't at the beginning, which may implies that Arthur couldn't make modifications to his skills on the fly as well?

So Arthur basically told Juniper that he doesn't believe Aerb is real? he saw the people closet to him as NPCs?

** So, last time he was adjusting his expectations about the quest based on the fact that he received it at level 2.

If he had actually gone there at level 2, he would have lacked all the things that let him pierce the illusion, and he would have been thoroughly taken in. Presumably that would not have been a Game Over, because the DM does actually want him to succeed, just without hand holding. He would have told the illusionist what he knew about Arthur, possibly even about his meta power. And that would /not/ have meant an unseen and unfelt dagger in the back for the safety of the world.

So, perhaps that means that the illusionist should be considered a potential ally?
