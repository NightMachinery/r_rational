1. "Villain": Somebody who's plans and actions involve a certain kind of apathy towards life that is almost unnecessary (but could prove to be necessary in the long run by the calculations of a superintelligence). Here, the villain might also have been portrayed as a hero in the story.
2. I'm not looking for examples like Big Brother. Not an oppressive central authority. Rather one like HpMor's Tom Riddle, or, in fact, HJPEV.
3. Sidequest: Does Giovanni from Pokemon: The Origin of Species appear to qualify for the said role?


** (Spoiler alert) Galbatorix from the Inheritance Cycle.

He killed (nearly) every single Rider and Dragon on the continent, which were the elite peacekeeping force. He stole the Heartstones of all the dead dragons, giving himself infinite mana. He established a reasonably stable empire as a buffer zone for himself.

He then threw his entire focus behind blocking access to magic to everyone on the continent without his permission, instead of spending time stamping down rebellions. This makes sense from a rational sense of striking at the root of the problem instead of playing catch up, although is very immoral and maybe stupid. The armies reconquering his land would cease to be a problem once his, and only his, mages can steamroll them, while also removing the ability for the elves to alpha strike him or resist his invasion of their lands.

The only reason he lost was Eragon talking to a bunch of dragon ghosts and them doing wishy-washy conceptual magic bullshit and make him feel so sad he commits suicide - despite magic (supposed to) be impossible.

He mind controlled a Rider into suicide bombing via the magical equivalent of a nuke, telling his own body to "be not" - which is a very low-energy spell that converts the matter to a giant explosion due to conservation of (magic) energy. It even worked as an area denial spell, poisoning the entire island of the Rider's HQ with magical radiation.

Common mistake. Him having the name of the ancient language made it impossible for people to use the ancient language to cast magic. Normally this means that it's effectively impossible to cast magic because of the extreme danger of using wordless magic, but the one group routinely shown to cast wordless magic safely are the dragons. Plus, this exact thing us foreshadowed with their previous act of large scale magic-- the dragons didn't directly kill the forsworn, instead, they made it so that the forsworn would commit suicide.

Galbatorix was, indeed, a fairly rational antagonist. But he was playing a game with incomplete information, and lost because of that.

It's not the dragons being able to cast the spell through the metamagic that's a deus ex machina, but the dragons casting the spell at all.

From Galbatorix's perspective, the hero finding a cache of dragon souls hidden through a last ditch long con due to some prophecy and so is able to cast the one spell your 100 year metamagic working can't block is a lot of stars that needed to align.

***** Judging by the fact that sapphira alone had already done metamagic twice (elda, rose crystal), it can't have been /that/ rare. Especially since it's mentioned that a number of Elduarni use dragon magic to kill /themselves/ rather than be enslaved. And it's not like there isn't precedent for the dragons using metamagic against galbatorix specifically. In fact, I'd wager that galbatorix had even taken precautions against dragon magic specifically, seeing as he was succesful in killling so many.

What makes the final use of magic so interesting was that it was a legitimately clever attack vector. They don't mind control galbatorix into killing himself. They don't even directly cause his guilt; they show him other people's suffering. Plus, there's actually precedent that also explains why galbatorix hadn't protected himself against that spell-- it's mentioned that while future seeing is flatly impossible, seeing the past is doable, assuming you're content with grainy images and killing spell circles of elven mages. So the only concievable people who could cast that spell would be a whole bunch of old dragons, which galbatorix had thought he'd gotten rid of.

The only part that could be called a deus ex machina would be the fact that the stash of dragon souls existed im the first place, but it had been foreshadowed ever since book one with solembum's advice (and it /would/ make sense for the dragon riders to pass their secret to the werecats, who weren't at war with galbatorix...), and at least from the literary perspective, again in book 2, where glaedr refuses to mate with saphari (which makes no sense from a preservation-of-the-species perspective, unless you realize the author intended to have a cache of dragon eggs all alone.)

I admit-- this is bullshit from galbatorix's perspective, but /any/ loss, from his perspectice, would be bullshit, because as a century old dragon rider with hundreds of dragon souls at his beck and call, the /only/ rational way to kill him would be with information assymetry.

It's my personal opinion that the way paolini handled galbatorix's final defeat was one of the best scenes in the books.

That, too, is justified in text. Remember-- the control system of magic (the ancient language) was a later addition, specifically because truly "magic-y" magic was so dangerous.

What did Galbatorix gain by getting the name of the ancient language? 1) The power to cast any spell, with or without the words. 2) His spells can't be copied - he casts 2 spells at once, one of which erases the name from the memory of people he doesn't want knowing it.*

*That's not something precise - he probably didn't know what part of the brain stores the memory. While anyone could achieve that effect (erasing a specific memory) by destroying the whole brain, with the 'ancient language' you can do anything you can describe. And it happens.

Why would people /ever/ give up that power?

Why try to do something like making an AI slowly, over lifetimes, when you can just cast one spell? Whole brain emulation is difficult with our technology, but with magic brains could not only be 'emulated' but duplicated. Telepathy has already been achieved - no words required for that magic.

If there was an impact in the series, I'd say magic 1) gives spellcasters a way to estimate the energy cost of a task - raising the dead, seeing the future, etc. (What spells /will/ kill you, and all your friends, from the cost to cast is known.) and 2) gives people a reason to be superstitious. (Not to mention 3) being aware of existential threats - the creation of the ancient language was the solution to a problem, which had almost destroyed the world/wiped out life.)

I disagree so strongly that I can't think of terms strong enough to convey it. I understand that your preferences will by definition be highly subjective, but it really feels like you're just saying "I enjoy soft magic therefore all hard magic is bad and pointless," which is needlessly smug and dismissive.

I think your opinion on this is colored too much by your impression of what "magic" should be, while I believe a more helpful way to look at it is just as a catchall term for any system in a fictional work that violates our physical laws as we know them. To give an example using physics, it's like you think of gravity when you hear "physics," and thus immediately dismiss anyone who uses the term "physics" to refer to inertia; it's not that inertia is pointless, but rather that it's a different thing from gravity, and conflating the two doesn't help the discussion.

******* That ward doesn't stop, for example, a spell that freezes the air directly around Eragon in place. Plus, it depends on Eragon's interpretation of "spell" and "permission". It must be at least partially permissive, or it would try to nullify all magic in his presence, costing more energy that he had and killing him. So Eragon's interpretation of "spell" and "permission" must by necessity not be maximally permissive, so Galbatorix could get around that specific ward by choosing an attack vector that Eragon wouldn't perceive as a "spell", or just barely qualified as being "permitted" by Eragon. Similarly, Galbatorix likely had his own, similar wards, but for whatever reason, the draconic spell bypassed them. Or hell-- maybe his wards blocked the spell, but then he had a failsafe ward that disabled his wards if they would cause him to expend too much energy at once, because a smart opponent could try to create a spell that simply cost more to block than to cast, and make it an endurance contest. Wards in IC necessarily can't be perfect because it's always a tradeoff between energy use and covering loopholes.

Also, although we're never told this outright IIRC, the whole setting makes more sense if more vague/general spells are significantly less efficient, or have some other major disadvantage. So a ward general enough to prevent really weird forms of attack which the caster never specifically considered might still not be very /good/ at doing so, even if the caster is extremely powerful.

*** The wards Galbatorix laid over Urubaen as a trial run of his eventual magical lockout nullified all magical attacks launched without his permission. Magic in the Inheritance Cycle is basically a programming language, so warding from magical attacks is all it did.

What happened to Galbatorix was another case of fencepost security. He stopped magical attacks, but Eragon did not intend his final action before being suborned as an attack. The text says that it was an attempt to communicate, and Galbatorix had not blocked magical communication. He arguably couldn't, as telepathy is an integral part of the magic system.

You could argue that draconic magic is a bullshit deus-ex engine given that it apparently removed the concept of the first person singular from several beings, but I'd argue it has something to do with dragons being alien intelligences. They mostly think the same way Elves do, due to the dragonrider pact, but they're still giant murderous magic death lizards. The amount of energy necessary to prevent anyone from remembering names and stop a few from thinking in first person isn't actually that huge, so magic specifically structured to do that should be entirely doable if you have an intelligence capable of imagining the whole concept at once and instantiating it. Similarly, causing a single person to understand the magnitude of their sins should be really cheap, and you had another massive hive of draconic minds participating in that project as well to imagine the full extent of the concept. You even had a human mage present to channel the idea through, which makes it even easier.

So what happened in that room can be summarized as so: you had one force of insane, poorly-organized dragons attacking the mind of a single human mage, bolstered by a single, organized hive of draconic minds who had spent centuries working together. You had another mage who had gained the ability to directly edit the Rules of Magic, but wasn't very good or confident with the ability yet and was being conservative with it. This is a classic centralized intelligence versus individual value-drifters situation, so it isn't too surprising that the greater intelligence beat the disorganized raw power by finding a loophole in the rules as they understood them and just going for it.

He's already guarding the mostly-impassable mountain range surrounding Mordor, adding heavily-garrisoned walls to the few passes, and putting the giant spider, what'shername, in the tunnel. At some point you have to say "this weakness is adequately guarded, time to put some of my army into attacking". As for the Nazgul there are only nine of them and presumably they have high-priority tasks like terrorising the Shire, corrupting the southern marches, and preventing Gondor from calling for aid, to be about.

***** Sure. But widening the area to guard requires exponentially more troops.

He obviously commands legions. Surely it would take a few hundred, Maybe a thousand, to guard mount doom itself.

The natural terrain already makes it difficult for a large army to reach it. So the question is if a small group could sneak by his forces. If you have a single weakness, that leads to your absolute destruction, I would not gamble on my guards accurately stopping spies. There are always reasons to be passing through somewhere, or a spy sneaking over the mountains. But this area of no-mans-land has no reason to be there.

The Nazgul part is a bit extreme. But is sending 4 Riders to the Shire instead of 3 more important than defending his one weakness?

The quest succeeded because Mount Doom was completely unguarded. Sauron managed to reclaim power from nothing, despite being vanguished beforehand. Clearly his might was great. Time was on his side.

He was right on the brink of winning a large military campaign, but his bodyguard killed him because the bodyguard found out that the Empire intentionally wasn't healing his planet in order to keep his species subservient. The military campaign then collapsed without his genius to guide it.

I'm not sure how much of a deus ex machina that was, though, since it's been a very long time since I've read the trilogy. At the very least, it's something Thrawn had no possible way of seeing coming.

*** EDIT: expanded out a bit at [[https://www.gwern.net/Notes#the-tragedy-of-grand-admiral-thrawn]]

It's a /little/ bit of a deus ex machina, but as they go, I think it's very acceptable because all the mechanics are laid in place well in advance in [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Thrawn_Trilogy][/The Thrawn Trilogy/]], and the assassination itself serves a major literary purpose of demonstrating [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mitth%27raw%27nuruodo][Thrawn's]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartia][fatal flaw]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris][hubris]] leading him to a tragically bad end.

For years I was vaguely puzzled by the ending: sure, it made logical sense that the Noghri would retaliate by killing him, didn't violate any rules or worldbuilding or anything, but it felt unmotivated and lacking in literary purposes - why did Timothy Zahn choose that particular way of dealing with Thrawn when /Star Wars/ villains have often been dealt with in so much less final ways? After reading a boring Greek tragedy, [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Command][/The Last Command/]] finally clicked for me.

So first, the timing of the assassination is not implausible: the bodyguard can pick and choose the time, and since they can't expect to escape alive, they'll want to maximize the damage - major combat was common for Thrawn, his bodyguard would know this perfectly well, and also know that killing him in the middle of a battle based on having access to Thrawn's strategic genius would maximize the damage.

Second, the betrayal is also plausible, because Leia had at this point spent like an entire book or two on the [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Noghri/Legends][Noghri]] home planet, uncovering the deception, so it's been thoroughly established for the reader that 'the Noghri clans know how they have been deceived and enslaved for generations and that their gratitude/worship of Darth Vader (and then Thrawn) as a hero is the cruelest of lies'; the reader expects them to be... not happy about this.

Third, that Thrawn /wasn't/ expecting it is what makes it so ironic and dramatically satisfying: his last line is "But... it was so artistically done." Some people read this as referring to the battle or perhaps Thrawn's long-term plans or even the assassination itself (being stabbed in the back is 'so artistically done'?), but I've always read it as obviously referring to Vader's deception of the Noghri where the environmental cleanup robots etc were actually keeping the planet poisoned & destroyed; he understands the only reason [[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rukh/Legends][Rukh]] would ever assassinate him is that the deception has failed and the Noghri found out, and he is disappointed that the so elegant and artistic scheme has collapsed.

Now, the /reader/ might reasonably say 'hey, maybe you shouldn't rely for bodyguards on a race of murder-ninja-lizards who you are tricking into generational servitude by a vast scheme of planetary destruction masquerading as a charity and who might find out at some point and not be happy, and find someone else to be your bodyguards?', but the reader is of course not a twisted strategic genius who delights in deception & trickery & exploiting the psychology of his enemies (remember the [[https://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/node/id/504][definition]]: "thrawn (adj). twisted; crooked") and enjoys keeping 'his friends close but his enemies closer', so to speak. This delight is Thrawn's fatal flaw, which leads him into the hubris of taking such an extreme risk which will explode in his face, and the lack of necessity is precisely what makes it tragic; and a good tragedy always ends in death. Unlike a more standard tragedy where our protagonist is a good guy, Thrawn is an irredeemable bad guy, so while he realizes his proximate mistake ('what a pity that the deception failed... even though it was so artistically done'), he doesn't get any [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagnorisis][anagnorisis]] of his own flawed 'thrawn' nature being his fatal flaw like a hero would (ie he doesn't reflect 'well, that was really dumb & evil of me; I didn't need Noghri bodyguards /that/ much to justify ticking time bombs or poisoning their world').

And the fact that the assassination happens during a critical battle, which might have paved the way to victory, aside from being rational in-universe, only increases the tragic element: he was undone by his fatal flaw at the height of his powers and success.

'Oh, he just got stabbed in the back for some reason, isn't that an amusing lampshading of a trope - his betrayal is /literally/ backstabbing, geddit!' It lacks any kind of global significance which ties everything together in a thematically-meaningful way as suits the final chapter of the Imperials in the final book of the trilogy.

Whereas if it's the culmination of his character flaw of loving lifelong scheming even to the point of unnecessity backfiring on him in a dramatically ironic fashion, then it accomplishes all that. A bad writer might simply have Thrawn be backstabbed by a random mook; a good writer gives the mook a reason and backstory and motivation which makes it a commentary on why Thrawn is evil & loses.

  Sidequest: Does Giovanni from Pokemon: The Origin of Species appear to qualify for the said role?
#+end_quote

I don't... /think/ so.

Firstly, he hasn't lost yet. Last we saw, Mewtwo was plotting, basically, to betray him, but we haven't seen what counters Giovanni has in place for such an event. Counters which are likely several layers deep; between how smart he's supposed to be and the danger a hostile Mewtwo poses, I honestly expect Mewtwo's first genuine escape attempt to fail in some significant way.

As for whether he's a villain... well, I see a lot of parallels between the Mewtwo Project (I don't remember what it's called in-story) and the rl!Manhattan Project.

- Both worked on the cutting edge of known science (nuclear physics, psychics and genetic engineering).

- Both are arguably working towards a degree of salvation for humanity (Stop WW2/get the bomb before the Axis, remove the threat of Legendaries).

- Both have terrifying possible consequences for failure (Axis gets the bomb first and uses it, deaths and infrastructure damage continue unabated).

- Both have terrifying possible consequences for success, /which might be even worse than failing/ (basically the Fallout series, homicidal Mewtwo).

Giovanni's goal (or what I assume his goal is) seems pretty noble on the surface: remove hostile Legendaries as threats to humanity. We haven't really seen that much of what it took to get that project to its current stage, but from what little we do know, I expect the pile of sins to grow steadily larger.

tl;dr: Maybe? Too early to say, really.

***** Depends on what his hypothetical goals are. I agree that canon Light didn't act rationally, but I think what you're suggesting is too much of a goal-shift. He wants to punish people he sees as evildoers, and I think one stated reason he wants to do this is to deter people from committing such crimes. If no one knows there's any sort of pattern at all, then the "deterrent" aspect doesn't work.

Edit: I'm seeing in that link on [[https://gwern.net][gwern.net]] from another comment the suggestion that Light could make it seem like the deaths are happening as a natural course of the crimes; e.g. have them all be executions or something. I'm swayed, but unconvinced. I'm having a hard time imagining him killing enough people to make it a solid deterrent without anybody noticing some kind of anomalous effect, e.g. that controls execution procedures and makes them speed up somehow. Something like that would still alert people that some strangeness is going on -- that's the point, after all. Buuut, if he did that, it would at least seem likely to sidetrack L's investigation into folks with political power to determine execution procedures/schedules, though, before focusing L on potential generalized vigilante forces. I'd be curious to see this written up as a fanfic if anybody wanted to try their hand!

Fully rational Light would need to find the best line to ride, such that people are still scared to commit murders, lest they suffer the consequences -- but he needs to hold back a /lot/ more, be a lot more reticent to kill, be much more careful about his pattern, and provide L far less information than he did.

This is definitely a turning point. It also shows that his morals are very easily bent, since he goes on to kill innocents at the drop of a hat, as soon as he thinks they oppose him.

On the other hand, one could argue if your problem is, more in abstract, 'justice' and quality of life for common people (something he often brings up), then killing criminals just isn't the way to achieve that anyway. There are far bigger threats, and improving the world in other ways would probably /also/ result in less crime. Of course a person with a strict deontological ethic simply /wouldn't use the Note/ no matter what, but if you came at it from a Utilitarian perspective there definitely would be cases where it makes sense to use it. Just not as much, as frequently and as blatantly as Light did.

That was my point. If L had been less principled, he'd have decided that Light was Kira (he was pretty sure about that) but there was no way to have him put under trial by a normal court. Hence, he would have just killed Light, the end. The problem is someone who both had the means and the resolve /had/ found out his identity. Light got only saved by L wanting to do things by the book. Had it been someone like Mello instead of L, well, Light would have been a goner.

Come on, /seriously/? There is no empirical evidence that if I disobey the Bible's commandments I incur in any kind of measurable punishment. But Kira kills the fuck out of you if you step out of line. In the second part, it's even hinted that Kira plans to eventually move to kill not just criminals, but the members of society he deems "unproductive". Mikami mentions that, and Light thinks "it's too soon for that". Meaning he /did/ plan on doing it eventually. That's a very concrete loss of liberty right there.

Besides that, it's a loss of the guarantees a proper justice system is supposed to offer. Proportionality of punishment to offence, a fair trial. You get death for anything that Kira judges to be worthy of it, /if/ Kira judges you culpable. Kira may or may not be under extreme stress and pressed by other concerns while passing judgement and may or may not delegate the killings to his air-headed top model/idol girlfriend whose only moral compass is that she wants to please him. Who the hell would trust a system like that?

That's an edge case and you know it. [[https://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7230][4.1%]] of death row inmates would be exonerated eventually- that's the minimum value for wrongful convictions for capital offenses. [[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/251115.pdf][Other crimes]] have higher rates of wrongful convictions, 11.6% for sexual assault for example. The reason why the death penalty is wrong, even if you don't believe creating more death in response to death is bad, is that every 1 out of 20 people you kill is innocent. And this is getting a lot of attention today, the UN has put out a moratorium on the death penalty (which the US is not following, go figure) back in 2007.

That's just one problem, [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Capital_punishment][there's a whole rabbit hole]] of reasons the death penalty shouldn't exist you can go down, some of which apply even more so to Light.

I realize you said you don't support this sort of thing, but it really sounds like you're trying to justify it. So I have to argue against it.

Anyway, Light is killing for crimes that have much less work done into showing guilt, so anyone involved in the criminal justice process (ie the people trying to catch him) are going to /really/ dislike him. [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267209738_Public_support_for_vigilantism_An_experimental_study][Here's]] a paper on support for vigilante justice. People support it, but I imagine that would change pretty quickly in Light's case once someone shows an innocent person was executed. And the death penalty doesn't deter capital crimes anyway, so he wouldn't be doing any good.

  Depends on what his hypothetical goals are. I agree that canon Light didn't act rationally, but I think what you're suggesting is too much of a goal-shift. He wants to punish people he sees as evildoers, and I think one stated reason he wants to do this is to deter people from committing such crimes. If no one knows there's any sort of pattern at all, then the "deterrent" aspect doesn't work.
#+end_quote

The problem is that his strategy doesn't work for that. He is dependent on the justice system and news to identify targets. If he creates an obvious pattern then people will also notice that he only targets the convicted and then only the convicted that appear in the news.

Since he only targets the convicted then he won't be much more of a deterrent than the existing justice system and eventually people will learn to stop reporting the identities of convicted criminals.

But as a means to an end (namely, making the world a more just place, which was his stated goal) it's very irrational.

What else could you do with the death note?

I guess the first thing to do is have Bill Gates set up a census of the planet, make a bank that has an account for everyone on the planet, and make them all have their name. Then have a backdoor into this list of people or make it public. That at least will be useful to avoid murdering the wrong person.

*** This was my reaction the first time I watched the show, but I don't really think this is the case.

The ending feels wrong, because it seems like Near wins, when Near didn't really "earn" that win. Near only won because Mello did something completely reckless and self-destructive (what many people would consider to be irrational). If Mello were not part of the picture and completely blind-sided both of them, Light would have won.

But the fact that Mello was still in the picture at that point was Light's fault: there was an entire arc that pitted the investigation team (led by Light) against Mello and his mafia goons. Light's investigation team failed to apprehend Mello. If Light had apprehended Mello when he had the chance, Mello would not have pulled the stunt that caused him to flinch at the last minute, and he would have beat Near in a fair fight. For the fact that Mello was still around to cause, Light has only himself to blame.

You might argue that Light /could/ have beat Mello, because in the end, his father Soichiro Yagami had a death note and knew Mello's name, and /if Soichiro Yagami would just write his name down and kill the bastard/, Mello would be out of the picture. In this moment, it seems like the elder Yagami is to blame, because Light set up everything perfectly for his father to kill Mello, and his father failed to follow through. "All he needed to do was kill our enemy!" shouts Light in frustration as the light fades from his father's eyes. "How could my father be such an idiot?"

However, the fact that Light's father couldn't bring himself on his deathbed to kill Mello is consistent with his character. Sure, Soichiro Yagami's inability to kill Mello in the final moments is frustrating, but is it really /surprising/? If Light's plan hinged on his father's ability to use the death note to kill, then he is guilty of typical minding: Light has no problem with killing people to achieve his ends, so he assumes (or hopes) that when his father is faced with the simple task of killing Mello, he'll be able to do the same. However, Soichiro Yagami is not his son. He clearly demonstrated this to Light (and the audience) when he willingly took the deal for the Shinigami eyes, forfeiting half his own remaining lifespan. This is something I pointed out in a recent [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egQ9o2VSHNw][video essay about Death Note and its magic systems]]: Light is willing to kill, but not willing to forfeit half his remaining lifespan. His father inverts this, by willingly sacrificing half his own remaining lifespan, but finding himself unable to kill in the final moments.

Light might complain that he's surrounded by idiots, but if your plan involves relying in said "idiots" to behave out of character, do you really have a right to complain when they let you down? It doesn't feel "fair" that Near wins even though Near didn't really outplay Light. But the fact that Light lost despite his ability to beat Near in a fair fight is the entire /point/ of Death Note's second half: Near and Mello together are able to accomplish what L couldn't do alone. Light had a chance to deal with Mello early on, and failed. Then, he lost because of interference from Mello. Whose fault is that?

Yes, the chain of events by which Mello's interference causes Light to lose feels poorly conceived and hackneyed and unfulfilling, but Light would have never had to deal with this curve ball if Light had dealt with Mello the first time the two of them squared off. Watching the series the first time, my impression was that Mello beat Light once, but then Light came back and beat Mello the second time the two of them squared off, and so it felt weird when Light lost. But the first time that Light allowed Mello to escape, he had already lost: his "victory" against Mello is ultimately hollow, because it ends with Mello dying, but in "beating" Mello the second time, Light's side flinches, and that's enough for Near to ultimately unravel his web.

Also, as an aside, there's the whole thing where Light meets with one of his disciples (Kiyomi Takada) and they communicate "covertly" by writing each other notes on pads of paper that were provided for the meeting and then destroying the notes. This is an ill-conceived plan from the beginning, as it should be pretty easy to count the number of sheets of paper in the room before and after the meeting to determine whether any paper was used or destroyed. Aizawa uses a more direct method to catch Light (he marks one of the sheets of paper, and finds the marked sheet missing), but Light's entire plan for communicating with Takada did not come across as the scheme of some brilliant mastermind.

It's been heavily hinted that he's his universe's inventor of the Sauron, my tools make you into me magical basilisk hack.

** Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love. Not only has multiple chances to kill Bond, but actually has to keep him alive surreptitiously until he's out of the country with the Lecter decoder machine. Is defeated when the train they're on goes through a tunnel with him just a few feet from Bond, holding him at pistol point.

** /Charles Adair/ from /Super Powereds/, I won't go into spoilers but: Save for perhaps the premise, the execution and steps taken to make sure his plan would succeed were fairly logical. And technically he does achieve his goal.

And the only reason he was caught was due to the combined efforts of over a dozen people just as smart and/or determined as him.
