Meta commentary is also welcome, but tag it with [META] so that we can tell which posts are meant to be "in character" and which contain omniscience, without having to squint.

(e.g. if someone posts about genre savviness, they could very easily be doing so "in character" as a real human noting things about the world, or they could simply be offering literary commentary.)


** They can plainly see our use of technology. The effects of our intelligence are visible from space. They understood us well enough to emote at us with a humanoid figure giving human gestures. After all this they /still/ did not consider us sentient. Even if they truly made a mistake, they do not share our values - whatever moral reasoning they claim to have is clearly not analogous to human moral reasoning.

We need every public official to submit to a mandatory MRI.

We need every employer to require mandatory yeerk screenings.

We need to offer free screenings so that every family can make sure there is no yeerk possession among their numbers.

We need every private citizen to submit to the screening before being trusted with absolutely anything.

****** There are ways, you would just have to spend some time thinking about them. For example, you could broadcast the MRI results live to a crowd of people which is statistically unlikely to be /entirely/ controllers. The important thing is to make sure large crowds are monitoring the "choke points" of information flow - you don't want any single area entirely made by controllers. You could also just have a live three day quarantine to be safe.

Come to think of it, this is a war that must be fought with very /rigorously/ public access to all important information. Because the single worst thing that can happen is if you have a tightly knit group operating in secret (say, the CIA) and every single one gets taken by yeerks and controls the entire public.

We can still have war secrets, but they can only be kept by a publicly verifiable uninfected cohort.

(I say "rigorous" because it must not be fake-able - for instance, having a media outlet disseminating information doesn't work if yeerks infest the whole outlet. No information is trustworthy unless a large mass of the public can verify how information flow happened)

Even if we capture yeerks and watch them die 3 days later... for all we know they're able to voluntarily suicide, and are under instructions to drop dead after 3 days when captured so as not to give the game away for the undetected yeerks.

That said, the majority of eschatological scholars who took a strongly literal, future, and apocalyptic interpretation of Revelations also believed in a pre-tribulation rapture. One of the requirements of a scientific theory is that it can make predictions and that it doesn't require post-ad-hoc fitting. Naturally, there hasn't been any mass disappearances that fit with the rapture. I'll definitely keep Revelations in mind, but if all the events require this much stretching and cherry picking to make fit, I am not buying it.

That said, messages from the future in the form of prophecy are about as plausible as FTL+telepathy so I think taking a second look various prophetic traditions might be useful. Anyone familiar with Nostradamus?

I can't think of any logical motive for aliens to carry them out, but their capabilities are so weird that I wouldn't rule anything out.

****** For demonic motives on classical alien and UFO activity:

- Not sure why they would abduct cattle, but that is an activity trickster spirits in folklore would engage in, so assuming the folk stories have any grain of truth, they are presumably continuing their old activities in a more modern guise.

- A lot of the "alien" experimentation has a weird focus on human genitals. In many mythological traditions there is interbreeding between humans and the supernatural: nephilim in the bible, demigods in Greek myth, Kitsune marrying humans in some of the stories from Japan, fairies switching human and fairy offspring and leaving changelings, etc. Whatever motive existed for these entities to create part human hybrids (better adaption to our physical world? some abstract metaphysical purpose?) might still exist in modern times, they are just continuing their old methods.

- Crop circles seem pretty obvious. A lot of mythological traditions put a great magical importance on symbols. Crop circles are just a convenient way to make large scale symbols quickly with minimal physical intervention in the material world.

As for alien motivations, I think I thought of a few:

If the Yeerks story isn't BS, then genetically engineering a lifeform or even just a body from scratch is a lot harder than we guessed, at least compared to interstellar travel and outright interstellar warfare (or else why not engineer bodies from scratch). Likewise, the alien "Esplin" acted like it was dying, so they also presumably don't have mind uploads? If that is the case, experimenting on intelligent lifeforms is a lot more valuable than we would otherwise guess:

- The alien abductions are exactly what many UFO fanatics would claim: the aliens are experimenting on humans. Prior to the recent absurd events, I would point out obtaining a few genetic samples and then brute force simulating humans would be easier than interstellar travel, but apparently this is incorrect.

- Crop circles could have been attempts to study the mimetic spread of symbols by artificially introducing symbols. If humans are one of the few "sapient" species and engineering a species from scratch is harder than interstellar travel, then humans could make a valuable test population.

- Cattle abduction: the aliens might have abducted and studied any number of species, we just notice cattle because we keep track of their number. Alternatively, if intelligence and tool use is rare, studying a domesticated animal might be interesting from to an alien.

- Roswell incident: exactly what conspiracy theorists think. If so, I really hope the US government shares that info. Still, even if it just weather balloons or whatever, just because this isn't real doesn't mean that UFO/alien abductions haven't been.

So yeah... I think there might be something to all the UFO folklore, a year is a little tight on time though. Assuming Esplin isn't a human made hoax in the first place I think I would take that bet. If the planet gets glassed or society collapses I wouldn't have to pay out, right? And wow I intended that as a joke but now it seems too dark.

Esplin had barely gotten out two sentences when this guy showed up, and a few angles show that the police just let him through. So this one, single guy, with no backup and no weapon I could see, he just confidently walks up to the self-professed alien war criminal with a sword for an ass.

/Then Esplin stuns the MIB dude!/ Right in the middle of talking about how he's learned to treat humans with dignity and respect! Then, only after Esplin has finished talking, MIB guy gets up and demonstrates that he apparently has the training and equipment to restrain a Yeerk space-cow, and he's still totally calm and collected despite having just been attacked.

So the police apparently finally get the memo to help MIB guy, and together, they stuff Esplin in the back of a black van and take off.

** Okay, no. This is - these aliens are nowhere /near/ advanced enough.

Look. Earth took billions of years to form, right? Then life formed. Some couple of billion years later, we get multicellular life. Then, nother billion years, intelligent life. Then a few million years before we settled down enough to start recording history. Then we're talking a few /thousand/ years to go from small villages with basic farming and ploughs to, well, internet and virutal reality and skyscrapers and everything. Each step takes less time than the previous step, right?

So, two intelligent species evolve. Fair enough. But each step in that process - there's no fixed length to them. Fraction of a percent difference one way or the other in the time it takes for intelligent life to turn up, and one life forms got a good couple of million years technology on the other.

Which means that there are only two reasonable ways we can expect to meet our first aliens. Either we go to their planet, and if we're /really/ lucky, and they're /really/ advanced, they've just discovered fire. Or, they come to our planet, and their technology's so far beyond ours that it might as well be magic, and will be completely incomprehensible; in short, they're wizards.

The idea that their technology is only a /little bit/ ahead of ours, to the point where we can usefully study it and learn from it, is laughable. Odds are this whole business was deliberately staged, start to end, with some unknown and possibly unknowable end goal.

(Mind you, I'm not entirely sure this "Esplin" was the one doing the staging. He might be a vat-grown creature with implanted memories. In fact, he probably is; he wants to die to sell his story, because that resonates with us, but he doesn't even know it's fake...)

And don't give me this aliens shite when there are NO scientific organizations reporting anything out of the ordinary in the past 3 months (oh but of course, they were all body-snatched, that's why no one who watches the skies saw anything, anywhere, in the whole world, right.

I don't get the people who take this thing seriously at all- if you actually believe in alien bodysnatchers, then how can you trust anything anyone tells you, even if (especially if) it's about alien bodysnatchers?

** So, there are not only aliens, but there are multiple kinds of alien who are at war with each other and until recently thought of us as, basically, livestock. Probably one of the worst ways to find life in the universe.

Notable aliens:

Yeerks: What their envoy claims to be. A slug that can crawl into things' ears and 'share its thoughts'. Presumably it has to be somewhere near your brain to do that, otherwise the ear thing would probably not be necessary. Starves after three days of continuous possession. Currently stationed on +Europa+ Europa's moon (thanks Jasmume16 for the correction).

Andalites: At war with Yeerks. Not clear what exactly they are. Apparently had better technology than the Yeerks do, which is saying a lot by the looks of those spaceships (/link to photos/). Sound pretty awful, but there's almost certainly at least a little bias.

Unnamed Blue Centaur: What their envoy is currently possessing. Don't think he said much about what this is.

Other notables:

Esplin: The Yeerk who gave the speech. Attempted to invade Ventura, realized midway that humans are people, and then accidentally destroyed Ventura once his 'stronghold' got destroyed. Absolutely horrifying; I'd hate to be the guy responsible for /that/. Willing to die for crimes committed, giving us their space ships to open up diplomatic options.

Unnamed Freedom Fighters: High schoolers (what the fuck?) who /somehow/ were going toe to toe with Esplin's forces, eventually blowing up their stronghold and triggering the dead man's switch. Again, absolutely awful to find yourself responsible for something like that. Even worse since they were trying to help humanity from the get go.

Unnamed Psychic Voice: Unconfirmed, but some people at the speech are saying they had a message placed in their mind. Message is consistent between multiple people (/transcript link/), hard to arrange this fast if hoax. Apparently not fond of Esplin. Andalite, maybe? Hard to guess with limited information.

It should go without saying, but take all this with a grain or a heaping tablespoon of salt. There's a lot we don't know, and only one source so far. If we can locate these freedom fighters, we might be able to get a clearer picture.

Are you sure? We might be assuming that the way our technology progressed is the only way for it to happen, but it's just as possible that the aliens completely missed things that were obvious to us. It's even possible that FTL was something "obvious" that /we/ missed - meaning we'd have better all-around technology. (This was suggested in a sci-fi story I read a while back, forget the name.)

Consider: the Aztecs discovered the wheel ... but never thought to use it to make vehicles, only kid's toys! Meanwhile, they had those obsidian-glass swords, but those never occurred to anyone in the Old World - even though we had obsidian and glass over here too. (Sure, they're worse than steel, but I assume they were better than bronze weapons since the Aztecs had bronze.) The ancient Greeks has steam engines thousands of years ago, but considered them a curiosity and never did anything useful with them. Why are we assuming that technology progresses on a fixed timeline, as opposed to random technologies being invented at random points in their history?

Consider: the aliens have shown two great technological feats; the spaceship, and the asteroid. Maybe throw in the fact they got here at all as a third "feat". But all of those are doable with just one technology - the FTL drive!

Who knows what their guns or computers are like. If they even have guns or computers! We haven't /seen/ any.

In fact, thinking about it, this Esplin announced himself by flying to the crash site in person - no radio message, nothing on TV. They supposedly didn't notice we were intelligent - but radio messages are the first thing our SETI program looks for. Do the aliens even /have/ radio?

However, I think it's most likely at least part of the story's right; why would they destroy Ventura for no reason? And if Esplin's telling the truth about the base being seriously harmed, I don't see how human teens could do it on their own - so we've got some aliens involved somehow. We might as well call them Andalites. And again, we know nothing about them except that they're fighting the Yeerks, and they're just as invisible to human sensors.

And... sure, the human teenagers might not be real, but again they might be. I can imagine some reasons why the Andalites would want less-conspicuous local help. I think we should tentatively take Esplin at his word, try to locate any of these teens who survived, and be on the alert for Andalites trying to recruit other human teens for their inscrutable ends.

** So... the fact that these aliens are able to have a war (i.e. the timescales and distances aren't too far apart for them), and the fact that we didn't see a near C ship enter our solar system (some with more astronomy check me on this, but I think decelerating after interstellar travel would leave very visible exhaust, as in you could see it with a telescope in your backyard) means that either these alien races are super long lived and/or have a very long-term oriented culture (and thus can fight wars on century long timescales and are willing to travel interstellar distances at timescales slow enough that they didn't have visible deceleration) or they have some form of FTL travel. Anyone back me up on this with more precise calculations?

So on one hand, from our current knowledge of physics, near immortal, super long-term planning aliens is more plausible than FTL. But that would mean that they have all that advanced tech (I think immortality is not very well selected for evolutionary so it would have to be artificial)... but they can't just genetically engineer bodies?

Also, they didn't recognize humans as sentient, but they are able to put on a near perfect performance (don't tell me the landing scene didn't look just too perfect)?

And then there is the mysterious psychic voice talking into people's heads... Direct mind to mind communication sounds really implausible from our current understanding of physics... it would take some type of media to transmit it. Say like nanobot released into the air. But if they have tech capable of manipulating minds like that, why stop at just communication? They alien claim to be symbiotic brain slugs (anyone reminded of Stargate?) but didn't recognize we were sapient? They decide to resort to diplomacy after a brutal massacre?

Anyway, something is off about all of this... the alien's tech capabilities don't make sense (I guess we'll find out when we try reverse engineering them) and/or our understanding of physics is very limited/wrong (FTL possible, true telepathy possible, etc.)... The alien motivations don't make too much sense either (not recognizing sapience, but perfectly able to communicate when it comes down to it).

On the plus side, with their capabilities, even if they have some easy FTL that doesn't require absurd energies (i.e. they don't have the energy to just blow up the planet and/or launch interstellar kinetic kill vehicles), they could still drop rocks on us till we all die, so whatever their goals/intentions, they don't want to just kill all of us.

*Crazy wild guess*: The aliens are actually demons (in the mythological sense): they possess people and their technological capabilities don't make sense. The asteroid was God/Angels/Gods smiting one of their initial footholds. The alien story is just to mislead us and distract us from how BS their tech is (FTL, psychic powers, interfacing with alien brains without bio compatibility issues, interstellar warfare being practical or possible, etc.)

***** Exactly what [[/u/Evan_Th]] said. With science (as a body of knowledge) completely failing to predict what we have observed, I am looking to other cultural sources of knowledge. In this case, the aliens are a decent fit to various myths about demon possession.

I still believe in the scientific method, so I'll make some advanced predictions for you: The "aliens" "tech" is going to have even more BS capabilities that make no sense given their overall apparent technological capabilities. These capabilities will make more sense when considered literal magic.

So some examples of stuff from various mythology that they could try passing off as BS tech or limitations to their tech:

- Being limited to acting under various astrological conditions. They will probably try to explain this with some babble about the quantum state of the universe [META: apparently they are dependent on z-space configuration which can vary over time naturally?]

- Shapeshifting ability that ignores mass limitations. If they had this capability, why can't they instantly create spaceships or materials/supplies? Why couldn't they instantly make host bodies for themselves/parasite race? [META: yeah I went there]

- Weird and arbitrary weaknesses. I.e. cold iron, salt, silver, their reflections. If they have some particular weakness to say, an Earth food, that they don't have to other Earth foods, I am going to call it as a rough match to this. [META: the oatmeal isn't a perfect fit, but if you are already starting to buy this story...]

- Psychic Powers, especially if they fit under conceptual/metaphysical categories: I.e. control the weather, control war, control love, control the sea, etc.

Aliens this technologically advanced, and that's his excuse for half a million people dead? "Oops, we didn't put in an off switch?"

Also, fuck this guy with his two ships. That's supposed to make us feel better? We have no idea how many of them there are, or how powerful their technology is. These could be their equivalent of slingshots.

Unless one of these teenage resistance fighters (I don't even know where to begin on that) shows up soon and corroborates, it would be absolutely stupid of us to take his word for anything. And when that teenager shows up, they'd better be willing to submit to whatever test is needed to make sure there's nothing in their head that shouldn't be.

Anyone here had friends or family in Ventura? Were they acting weird at all before it got hit? I know it's insensitive to ask, but we need to know what actually happened there, and we need to know sooner rather than later.

Also, should we be worried about these "andalites?" (sp?) If they don't like these guys (and its not hard to see why) they might not take it kindly if we do end up in some kind of federation with them.

Re - The deadman's switch: They might be telling the truth. Like, if you put a giant "if we lose we destroy everything" deadman's switch in place, you're not going to put any way to deactivate it in place. If you do, you're just begging for someone to hack them. And I guess his comment on "orders" and "subordinates" meant when they put the deadman's switch in place, not when it triggered? Or maybe they saw their fortress in Ventura explode and jumped to conclusions? I'm not trying to make excuses, mind you. Millions of people died in that explosion.

Re-Ventura: The most suspicious thing I heard of is there was a complete blackout in the city, and everything including internet and phone lines and traffic lights lost power at the same time, half-an hour before the meteor struck. At the time, the official explanation was "It's either because part of the meteor struck early and hit the power grid, or it's a coincidence, or it's not. We don't know". Maybe they were trying to cut communications to cover up their fortress exploding.

There was some good discussion on [[/r/uncensorednews]] about how the explosion couldn't have been a meteorite because it didn't have any debris cloud impacting around the rest of the planet [link]. There were rumors of weird goings on in Ventura beforehand, so I guess it was a CIA or army site transporting nuclear weapons, and they don't want to admit they fucked up and detonated one in a civilian area, so are concocting this "aliens" story as a distraction. Who wants to bet that this alien mysteriously dies or teleports away, and the spaceships turn out, by huge coincidence, to be too damaged to use?

** While given the circumstances I can understand people's mistrust, this really does represent a tremendous opportunity for us. Until now, I would have said humanity was destined to die quietly without ever leaving this one, admittedly nice, little rock. We shouldn't trust the aliens blindly, and anger over Ventura's bombing is definitely justified, but even a small chance this is legit makes the cost vs benefit of going along with the possibility of peace worth it.

Also, the rush to hostility here is hardly going to be conducive to good strategizing. Anger makes for poor planning. If nothing else, we should pretend to believe the Esplin, then take it somewhere quiet and pump it for information on its home planet, making our move only when the time is right. Aaand now I'm realizing this was probably the government's strategy all along. Time to see whether or not I get disappeared now, I guess.

(Yes, I'm sure someone will come up with a way to weaponize that - we did it with planes - but I doubt an alien engine is cheap enough for terrorists to make them.)

Interstellar engines are worse WMDs than anything humans have so far; either by reaction-mass-at-fractional-/c/, or by whatever more exotic effect they use.

And as many people learned recently, "rocks fall everybody dies" is just how interplanetary warfare works.

** [META] - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56uzvp/bst_q_request_itt_post_reactions_to_latest/d8pe4ch][This poster]] raises an interesting point. This thread is not really properly showing the emotional impact of having Vermont flattened by an asteroid impact. People would have relatives there - people would be angry - people would be upset. That level of sheer /hurt/ is not being reflected. We're - most of us - discussing the situation as though it were something that never really happened. We're analysing it, we're not emoting about it. Our parents, aunts, uncles, cousins are okay, none of them were really killed. We haven't felt that emotional impact, and so this thread isn't really reflecting it...

*** [META] Yeah, the problem is, acting emoting is /really really/ hard, like, you need to be a legitimate actor or proper author or something to have a good idea of how to talk. I'd probably be way too melodramatic if I tried to write a post in that sort of voice.

I think the person who shared the 911 thread on slashdot had the best idea. That's the tone that's probably most suitable now.

Also, given it's a rat!fic, it'd be quite easy to say "amid the torrent of overwhelming sadness at the injuistice at it all, there were also...." and only quote the "interesting" ones. Though it'd probably be best to have some wailing and gnashing of teeth, tone-wise, because you're right, we forget that the asteroid on Ventura county killed a ton of people.

Add that to me being on the other side of the world from California and I generally don't have occaision to be personally affected by these events.

Actually, after the Bataclan attacks, I wasn't able to get in contact with my Parisian penpal and I was silently seething about everyone posting about how we only care about Paris because we only care about white people and why isn't anyone putting the flag of Lebanon on their profile picture, when I was worried /one of my friends was dead/. Maybe I should try and channel that a little and write a comment. Maybe.

Lets ignore everything about the Fermi paradox, the impossibility of faster than light trevel, etc. Its a blue alien centaur, with a human face that speaks perfect English. I've seen more convincing aliens in Star Trek.

My bet is that its viral marketing for a tv show or game. MAybe a new VR one where you get to play as one of these slug aliens and control different animals, fighting against the nasty andalites. The line about teenage resistance fighters is a very obvious plot hook.

** I don't buy it. That 'asteroid' was probably a government weapons system, like the tungsten rod satellite things, and it either malfunctioned or was intentionally fired on the town (crater photos with map overlay HERE). Plus it's too convenient that aliens would just so happen to land in Washington DC, speak our language, breathe our air, and feel sorry for us. And the thing with the kids fighting them off is taken straight from a fucking movie.

** [Different poster] I think this confirms the theory we were discussing last week that the 'accident' in Ventura was no accident. The authorities are clearly trying to cover their asses after an accidental nuclear weapon explosion . There was some good discussion on [[/r/uncensorednews]] about how the explosion couldn't have been a meteorite because it didn't have any debris cloud impacting around the rest of the planet [link]. There were rumors of weird goings on in Ventura beforehand, so I guess it was a CIA or army site transporting nuclear weapons, and they don't want to admit they fucked up and detonated one in a civilian area, so are concocting this "aliens" story as a distraction. Who wants to bet that this alien mysteriously dies or teleports away, and the spaceships turn out, by huge coincidence, to be too damaged to use? Guess we'd better put even more money into the military industrial complex to fight off these evul sppaaahhs invaders!
