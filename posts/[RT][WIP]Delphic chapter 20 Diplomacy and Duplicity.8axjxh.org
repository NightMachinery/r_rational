** Huh. I don't know why I'm so surprised, but it seems that most fiction that touches on government corruption (particularly law enforcement corruption) seems to want to paint the entirety of the government as hopelessly corrupt because of some underlying truth about relationship between governments and their own power in society, etc.

Good to see a more nuanced take where just because some agencies or individuals are up to shenanigans it doesn't mean everyone nominally on their side is down for it. Will be interesting to see how things play out.

** Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

- Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
- Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
- The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

** I don't understand how he's so calm about forgetting half an hour of his actions so frequently! Especially when so many of his interactions are delicate balancing acts.

*** Having lived with someone with recurring short term amnesia, I can say it's plausibly realistic no matter how incomprehensible it is.

** I remember it said that superpowers that increases intelligence were impossible. Is that a cold cut case? What made worm good was all the tinkers out there.

*** There's a brief discussion in chapter 11 that no one with super-intelligence has 'gone public' with it, so the Doc thinks it probably doesn't exist... sort of like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox][Fermi paradox]].

Because the source of powers is very different here than in Worm*, anything that relies on a person being supplied with inexplicable outside knowledge isn't going to be a thing. The Manton Effect is also not a thing, for the same reason.

That doesn't mean there won't be cool tech solutions to problems; several of the characters including Hector himself are very much willing and able to tinker. But the tech they come up with will be sourced in modern Earth tech (with a nod to the alt-history that developed upsilon emitters in the 40s rather than nuclear fission).

*If the conversation gets into specifics on Worm, let's use spoiler tags.
