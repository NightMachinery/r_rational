Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have a security protocol from my NaNoWriMo story that I want to run by you guys.

This is aboout an organisation that needs to deal with demonic possession amongs its members. Possession can happen any time while someone is awake. Demons nor hosts have no control over this process and are not able to prepare for it (the demons only become sentient in the moment of possession), but the process is instantaneous and the demon is in full control of the host as soon as it happens. Demons have access to the all the skills, knowledge and abilities of their hosts with one notable exception: they cannot read or write, nor can they learn how to do so.

The organization in the story uses the following protocol to detect possession:

- Right after they wake up and then once every three waking hours each member of the organisation needs to contact a central location and answer a set of trivial questions through a text chat.

- The questions are stuff that everyone can reasonably be expected to know ("What colour is the sky?", "How many eyes does a cat have?") and each member gets send a different message.

- The other side of the chat is manned at all time by three people that check each others work.

- If any member fails to report in, someone from the magical inquisition immediately teleports in to check, in person, whether this member is still OK and take appropriate action if this turns out not to be the case (the organization has ways to know where each of its members are at all times).

This protocol has a serious weakness and I'd like to know if it is as glaringly obvious as I think it is. If you figure it out, please also indicate whether you saw it instantly or had to think about it. Also, if you have an idea for a fix I'd be very interested to hear that as well.

**** If you wanted a workaround for that, you would set up the system such that a random bystander wouldn't be able to read or write. If you went /really/ hardcore, you would have all your members learn how to read and write (but not /speak/) a language constructed by the organization, however you would go about doing that.

How effective this is would depend upon exactly what it means for the demons to be unable to read or write, which isn't trivial to define. (Character agnosia, maybe?)

It would also be a fairly interesting problem to see a demon crack on short notice, but depends a lot on specifics.

***** Oh, this is an interesting one!

Suggestion: the message to them is displayed in a fixed manner, center-of-screen, one word at a time, and they must read the word out loud within a time limit before it moves on to the next word. The voice recording is transmitted back and processed to confirm that it matches the message sent to them, and the voice fingerprint matches. If they take too long to read a given word, red flag. If the voice print doesn't match theirs, red flag. If it detects multiple people speaking the word in sequence, red flag. If the face recorded by the device camera doesn't match, red flag.

You can follow up (or even alternate, with a text describing which test this will be presented before each interaction) with making them write out their answer with a stylus - if the handwriting, or the biometrics of the way they are moving the stylus, don't match the profile, red flag.

The demons can't read OR write. As long as you're checking one of those things, you can free up the task bandwidth of checking the second for forgery checks.

Edit: Oh, the idea to use a conlang with no spoken form is a good one as well. It wouldn't even be that hard to implement - you could just create a new set of glyphs to directly substitute in character for character. If it's international enough, maybe use a language like esperanto that is designed specifically to be easy to learn. Questions could be sent out as pictures over standard MMS channels, with responses being texted back in whatever language is convenient. You could keep the "written with stylus and handwriting analyzed" element to keep them from being able to say, coerce another agent to answer for them.

** What kinds of goods would a skeleton-based economy import and export?

The rulers of Skeleton Island have knowledge of a ritual which reanimates a skeleton with the strength and skills of the deceased. The skeletons can react to stimuli, don't need to eat or breathe, and can perform any physical task which they learned before their death, but cannot learn new complex skills. The skeletons can also be 'programmed' to perform repetitive motions by a necromancer.

If Skeleton Island doesn't export the skeletons themselves (because they want to keep the ritual secret), what would the economy of the island look like?

Some ideas:

- Much of the living population should be paid to study skilled trades for their entire life, in exchange for pledging their skeletons to the service of the crown. Like life-long college with the loans due after death. (Depending on skeleton depreciation rate, it might not be optimal for the peasant to spend their /entire/ life learning.)

- The island could have a special secluded academy on a remote hilltop. They could pay huge sums for top artisans and sages to come teach at the academy, providing them plenty of luxuries but not allowing them to leave the campus grounds.

- The island also needs a group of living merchants, dignitaries, and maybe dockworkers to facilitate trade.

- I reread Alexander Wales' "A Bluer Shade of White", which features giant ice golems turning cranks to power textile and flour mills. Skeleton Island can probably do something similar, except skeletons are more dextrous than ice golems, and more difficult to replenish. So the island could export lots of hand-woven textiles, glassware, and other high quality mass-produced artisan goods. But turning a millstone might wear down the bones too quickly to be a good use of skeletons.

- A large number of skeletons could each provide a small amount of cranking power without wearing them down too much, but the opportunity cost of using that many valuable skeletons for energy generation makes me think importing coal would be a more efficient way to produce energy

- On that note, the island should import lots and lots of food. More food -> higher living population -> higher skeleton population growth rate.

*** Depending on local economics, taboos, and belief about the afterlife, shouldn't the island be importing skeletons/corpses rather than food to feed people that will eventually become corpses? There's a huge supply of corpses in other countries, and Skeleton Island has the vast bulk of the demand.

If they want to keep the /existence of the ritual/ secret rather than the /specifics of how to perform it/ then trying to buy up corpse supply from other countries might be a little suspicious, but nothing that couldn't be worked around. (I'm a little skeptical of the idea of keeping the existence of the ritual secret. Keeping the specific knowledge of how to perform it is more plausible, though both could be justified with sufficient effort.)

Skeleton wear rates probably need to be pinned down to make useful predictions about economic incentives for the necromancers. In either case, there are limits to how profitable a skeleton can be, given that a real person has to be trained in the skeleton skill and then die. In a sense, skeletons are just an economic multiplier on productivity, when considered over time; a worker has ~40 productive working years, then another ~X productive skeleton years after that.

I would think there would be some incentive to kill people before decrepitude, given that real life skeletons start to become weak in old age. Whether that would be acceptable to the population is a different question, but it's what a pure production-focused command economy would do.

The cheap mass-performed ritual binds the corporeal soul to the bones. The flesh is removed, fed to animals, and replaced with sterile wrappings. Or maybe the flesh is magically consumed in the ritual as the soul is condensed and fixated.

The more costly ritual is performed only on a select few and binds both the corporeal and ethereal soul to the bones. Like a lich whose phylactery is their own skull. Aesthetic-wise, picture a mummy with a toga and a painted mask.

In the long run, the secret will definitely get out. The ruling class of the island is gearing up for the conquest of a neighboring land to grab control of some scarce resource which allows them to prolong the functional lifespan of a skeleton. (There is a much more costly version of the ritual which fully preserves the person's mind. The queen has ruled for over a century.)

I suppose I could tweak the ritual to be performed on a living person instead of on a corpse. But on the other hand, entire graveyards being dug up and snuck onto boats sounds like a great plot hook, even if it does give away the secret.

Also, foreign corpses won't be quite as high quality. Without documentation from their lives, it will take some experimenting to discover what skills they were adept at. Imported warrior skeletons would be trained in traditional combat instead of martial arts designed for use by lightweight combatants with near-infinite endurance.

And culturally, the people of the island may just want lots of kids.

Even so, I think you're right that the relatively low cost of importing a corpse means that foreign skeletons would make up a large chunk of the 'programmed' skeleton workforce.

That is absolutely a part of the island's religious customs. People are given some say into how their ancestors' skeletons are used. And particularly wealthy families may have honored ancestors who tend to the house, cook family recipes, take care of children, etc. It's like gramma's immortal, but less talkative.

But if someone tries to be 'miserly' with their skeleton, then they forfeit this familial privilege, and their bones are sent to anonymously work in a sewer or something.

*** Not to lean into the cliche too much, but what about exporting war?

Have a group of people spend their lives training to become the best possible warriors, then after they die use their bodies to assemble a skilled skeleton fighting force. Then you /don't/ go conquering the world (that never works), instead mix the skeleton warriors with some human overseers and necromancers and sell their services to the highest bidder. Don't allow anyone to bid on the entire force either, instead make them bid for each battalion individually and make sure contract end dates are staggered. That way once one side of a conflict deploys your troops, the other side can place a bid for a battalion of its own once one becomes available. Ideally you get a bidding war going between the two sides.

Skeletons are (at least stereotypically) perfectly loyal and don't need to eat, which (besides being a massive advantage in mediaeval warfare on its own) also allows your troops to conquer regions without having to rely on plundering the countryside and/or committing war crimes against the local population. Your forces are the ideal troops for any would-be conqueror that wants to win the hearts and minds of his soon to be subjects.

Instruct your skeletons to always be orderly and polite (if they can speak), put clauses in your contracts that your troops won't be used against civilians, minimize damage to the towns and cities you conquer and allow enemy combatants (especially generals and nobility) to surrender peacefully. The more civilized war becomes the more profitable it becomes for you, both because it will set standards that your competition (ie. human soldiers) cannot meet and because if war causes less collateral damage, the people in power are more likely to resort to it.

(Strength of a grown man with 15% of the bodymass and unlimited endurance means they can load up on metal and padding.) But as soon as a skeleton is captured and dissected, the gig is up.

Have the necromancers compel the skeleton to follow work orders given by the client for a fixed period of time, and then stop listening to orders and return back to the island.

*** specialist skeletons: Scribes who deal with secrets. documents come in, results go out. this could include cursed books that will blind or kill the reader- skeleton scribes create non-cursed copies.

mostly, you import raw materials, and have your labor refine and manufacture. you can work non-stop around the clock, so each skeleton is on par with 2 or 3 workers (12 or 8 hour shifts).

skeletons can work without regard to toxins, be they gas or otherwise. this can result in safer handling of some materials, as the skeletons cannot die of exposure to poison (but you still need to worry about corrosives, as well as very hot fire).

skeletons will need some protective garments. this will reduce wear and prevent damage to the skeleton, thus protecting the investment.

big money imports: corpses of skilled workers. some of this is from graverobbers, which could bypass guild or family secrets.

*** Relying on trade for food could be tricky depending on weather and how far you are from your various trade centers, and depending on the stability of your relations with your suppliers. Famine is no joke, especially not in a setting without refrigeration and where agriculture is so inefficient that 8/10 people have to be farmers. You'll be the last to get food if other countries need to implement rations due to a bad harvest. Drought or crop blight 500 miles away from you could result in the starvation of your entire island if you're populated far beyond locally-sustainable levels. Alternatively, you might get price-gouged with food being offered only in tiny quantities at enormous prices.

To avoid that, you'll want to make sure to stockpile plenty of food that takes a while to go bad, like hardtack, dried fruit, dry-roasted and salted nuts and seeds, smoked and salted or brined meats, etc. Also, keeping plenty of livestock living off of imported hay would buy you some time, as the hay itself will take a while to go bad, and the livestock can be culled early to help get you through a famine. You'll also want to operate plenty of fishing or whaling ships to provide a decent local supply of food. You could also consider keeping pigs and feeding them food scraps on a large scale to reduce food waste. The pigs could also be fed the meat from your corpses as you process them into skeletons.

Additionally, you'll need to have a plan in place to prepare for if/when your trade partner(s) decide to start jacking up the prices on your imports in order to get a bigger share of your profits for themselves. Your best bet is to ensure that you trade very broadly so that you're working with at least 10 or more countries and at least a few dozen ports, making it difficult for all of them to agree on a plan to jack up prices for you, and easy for you to trade elsewhere if prices go up in a few places. You'll probably also want to operate your own trade ships and have your own established merchants in each of the ports you trade with so they can see local prices and get you the best deals.

With that said, one of your best industries might be shipbuilding. You're an island nation with huge needs for trade goods and seafood, so why not produce the ships locally? It would also put you in a good spot for mass-producing warships if/when your neighbors get jealous of your wealth and the secret of skeleton-making. Of course, with so many trade ships and fishing ships, you'll probably have substantial problems with pirates anyway, so having plenty of warships on patrol and performing occasional undercover operations (warship posing as a merchant freighter until the pirates come within striking distance) will help keep your losses to a minimum while also giving you considerable deterrence against aggressors.

Water supply could be another concern if you're populated far beyond locally-sustainable levels, especially if you're using freshwater in large-scale industrial processes like dyeing cloth for your textile industry. For example, suppose you're importing an average of 150 tons of flax every day to be spun into thread, woven into linen cloth, dyed, and then cut and stitched into all types of clothing, sheets, sails, etc. Suppose 50 of those tons are used in natural color for sails and ropes, etc. For the remaining 100 tons, suppose you alternate colors just once per day. On each blue-day you'd need to use about 3 tons of indigo, about 3 tons of potash or salt, about 200-250 tons of coal to boil the water needed during the dyeing step, and about 40,000 tons of water overall (for the dye bath as well for washing afterward). Average annual rainfall for Earth is about 990 mm. If you're using 40,000 tons of fresh water per day and you get average amounts of rainfall, you'd need to be capturing the entire rainfall from an area of 13,400 square kilometers (5,170 square miles), or about 80% of the land area of the state of Hawaii just for the dyeing, let alone drinking and washing water for the population. On an island smaller than that, you'd either need to import freshwater, develop some kind of water reclamation process, or simply scale back your production with 'wet' processes and switch to industrial processes which can largely be done 'dry', like carpentry, gem cutting, glass-making, or clothing production with already dyed cloth.

That said, if you're only perhaps 25 miles away from a country with a large river, it might not be unreasonable to buy rights to set up a watermill-powered pumping station to fill up a reservoir with 40,000 tons of water per day (not even 1/10,000th of the Mississippi river's outflow during the dry season). A sailing ship could likely make that round trip within four hours on average, and might be able to hold anywhere between 100-500 tons. If they're 200-ton capacity ships manned by 20 crew members and they can operate 90% of the time (the other 10% being used for maintenance and repairs), you could get the required water with about 37 ships and about 2,000 sailors working eight hours per day each on various shifts, or about 2,960 sailors if you pay them a weekly salary and give each of them two days off per week, two weeks of vacation per year, and five sick days per year. You could offload the ships with skeleton-powered pumps operated by old or mostly useless skeletons which aren't good for much more than walking.

As a note, 100 tons of dyed textiles per day would be about 0.04% of the Earth's global net textile production in 2017. Essentially, it would be about enough continuous clothing supply to meet the needs of roughly 3 million people. You can use that to gauge how much you should scale things based upon the population of your setting, and based on how many of those people would ultimately be buying cheap linen or cotton clothing from Skeleton Island.

**** I wanted to verify that it is actually reasonable to hire so many sailors to transport water for the dyeing process. So, more math: medium-weight linen would be about half a pound per square yard, so 150 tons of textiles would be about 600,000 square yards of medium-weight linen. With a traditional free-standing loom, you could expect a single weaver to make half a square yard in eight hours. With a somewhat more advanced hand-loom using heddles (developed in the 13th century), expect it to be more like 3-4 square yards in eight hours. With a flying shuttle (patented in 1733), it might be closer to 6-8 square yards in eight hours.

Skeletons will work about 3 times faster than humans per day since they can work 24 hours. So, you'd need about 400,000 skeletons on hand looms to produce 150 tons of cloth in a day. With medieval hand looms, it would be more like 50-66 thousand skeletons. With flying shuttles, you'd need somewhere around 25-33 thousand skeletons.

Additionally, for spinning the flax into thread, you could expect about four times as many spinners as weavers prior to the flying shuttle, so maybe 200-260 thousand skeletons as spinners if you're using 13th-century tech.

All told, when you're benefiting from the free labor of probably ~300 thousand skeletons in the textile industry alone (factoring in dyers, weavers, spinners, and clothiers), and who end up doing the work of over a million people (factoring in 24/7 work without sick days or vacations), a meager 3,000 extra sailors to provide the required water seems like a drop in the bucket. Skeleton Island should be exceedingly profitable.

***** Wow. Thanks for the detailed response.

Great point about fresh water. I hadn't considered that at all.

Thematically, I like the idea of having the island focus on textiles and naval power. Makes the connections to the British industrial revolution more obvious. My hope is that the player characters decide to pull a Samuel Slater.

*** Import: Raw materials of all sorts. Steel, cloth, wood, you name it.

Export: Finished goods. Swords, ships, spears, whatever.

Seriously, Skeleton Island has a /massive/ workforce. Plus, a workforce that doesnt need to eat, drink, or stop for sleep or entertainment. They'd make sweatshops look unproductive in comparison. So it would probably make sense for them to export vast numbers of goods - and import the raw materials to make those goods.

*** Presumably there will be no lack of bodies. In 3ish generations you have as many skeletons as people and in 3 more that number have doubled. If there's a culture they should have no lack of skelies.

Skelie farmers could provide the food for everyone given the lack. Skelie hunters could get pelt. Skelie seemstres can make cloth. Skelie miners can dig gold and minerals.

I suppose that a skeleton country quickly would drain easily assecible natural resources, so perhaps an older of these communities would be in constant search for rare natural resources, especially if those are needed for making or repairing skeletons. I would also expect that the comparative lack of manual activities would mean a lot of thinkers and people who enjoy fine exotic goods.

That is of course assuming that they aren't going to war against each other for skeletons since a skeleton based army gain much more for each victory than their opponents.

*** The island should import skeletons, mages, resources needed for reanimation, and raw materials.

The island should export manufactured/crafted goods, crops, etc.

​

For the native population, I'd expect it to be small, and almost entirely composed of mages and apprentice craftsmen as skeletons of master craftsmen should be able to teach their craft to students. However demand for the later would be limited by the supply of already trained skeletons for import. There's also be merchants and an administrator/aristocratic class directing the undead industrial machine.

** Let's say you are a law student who lives in an Urban Fantasy world (think Buffy, World of Darkness, or Twilight); you find out about the Horrible Secrets of the World, and want to help the supernatural creatures integrate into and become productive members of society.

How do you do that?

Do you specialise in, say, immigration law to help people get "papers" to live in your country? (I feel like this would inevitably involve forgery, which maybe a lawyer doesn't want to get involved in?)

Do you specialise in criminal law so you can negotiate to get vampires vampire-friendly accomodations (think: windowless cells with somewhat less concern in sentence length)?

Do you get a law degree, work in a generic firm, and then start "consulting" around the country / world, helping be a liaison between supernatural creatures and their lawyers?

Is law a really crappy career to pursue and you should pack it in and start over with something that actually helps?

*** I dont think starting from the assumption of a law degree is the best approach. but if you do, them aim for becoming a judge or politician, instead of just a lawyer.

a lot depends on the specifics of the world in question. WoD works with the 'kill anyone who finds out' premise most of the time, so if you arnt a part of that society, then any action you take will end up getting you killed.
