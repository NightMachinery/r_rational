Hello there, discarded half of Crayak's progenitor. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/m57xps/rtffwip_ranimorphs_the_reckoning_chapter_47/grakpbo/][I totally called it!]]

Anyway, this chapter answers so many questions and in a really satisfying way. I'd often wondered why the Ellimist seemed so /different/ in this story compared to his canon version. Of course plenty of other characters are different too, but usually those differences are in the service of creating /enhanced/ versions of the originals. V3 is a lot like his canon self but way more competent, the Animorphs are like their canon selves but also more competent (and more outgunned to match), and so on. Almost every character and species feels like a more fleshed out and/or more fully realized version of their canon selves.

But the Ellimist? He never really seemed like an enhanced version of /Toomin/ to me. His actions and behaviors and beliefs never felt like they were what happens when you start with the canon Ellimist and then take him to the next level. A lot of the time he seemed more like Different Crayak rather than being a more fully realized version of the things that defined the original character.

And now with this chapter, that odd note of confusion is finally resolved. The version of the Ellimist we see here, the /real/ Ellimist, is everything that an elevated version of Toomin should be. Fucking bravo.

P.S. was the communication via stitched-together memories thing inspired by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLrhQspf9Dw][this scene from Star Trek Voyager]] at all? That was the first thing I thought of when I saw what was happening in the chapter here

**** I tell you what, this point of the Ellimist being the discarded remains of Crayak really adds a nice level of poetry, though.

Whether he realises it or not, Crayak is basically at war with himself --- Both halves are utilising reality-manipulating powers in an attempt to resolve the order/unity/silence vs chaos/harmony/noise paradox that seems to be at the core of /human/ need.

We need certainty, security, comfort --- needs that Crayak was probably born from and in his current form aims to protect. Without these, we live in fear, or never truly live at all.

So we paradoxically /also/ need /un/certainty, variety, challenge --- The very things Toomin/Ellimist has based his existence on. This is what brings us happiness in the end, and why risk vs reward is a thing.

So Ellimist vs Crayak is really one being trying to resolve two seemingly incompatible world views, just as we all are individually.

Or maybe Crayak abandoned the Galaxy after he recovered from what he had fled?

If Father had no memory of its origins, the Ellimist wouldn't have either. This leads us to conclude that Crayak must have been the one to give Jake a morph vision of Father's creation. But if Crayak knew that the Ellimist inherited the mantle of Father, that would seem to throw a giant wrench in the Ellimist's plans, right?

**** I think Crayak never knew what happened to the cast-off portion of itself. But even if it did find out eventually, I don't think that knowledge really matters either. What mattered for Crayak is that it came across another superintelligence that was in the way of its goals, and it decided to take up the offer of the game as a better way of winning their conflict vs open war. How the enemy intelligence came to be is largely irrelevant to that conflict.

**** Aiui,

- Crayak's goal is to tile the universe in habitats for its (long dead) creators.
- Toomin's goal is to make the universe happy / free / safe / generally better for sapients.
- Their order vs chaos motivations, as described by the Avatar, suggest that the Game is meant to generalize a competition between those goals, going more abstract, with the ultimate goal being to determine whose imprint is left on the cosmos.
- Win conditions for the Game remain unclear. Some lines in this chapter suggest that baiting the other player into breaking a rule, or sacrificing their values, was always treated as a win condition.
- The way I understand the Chee is as Toomin's gambit, creating something that the Ellimist would want to protect (the legacy of the Pemalites), but would be unwilling to allow to ascend because of the threat they pose at full power. Crayak is in agreement that they would be a threat, but believes that Ellimist can be convinced to sacrifice himself to stop them should they be unlocked, so sets up the plot to have them unlocked. This was Toomin's plan all along, so that Crayak could win the Game on Toomin's terms, leaving an opening for his Rachel gambit.

Iow, Crayak is a paperclip maximizing UFA, the Game was a trap to lure Crayak into a moment of vulnerability, and the Chee rising was Crayak thinking it had set a trap for Ellimist, but Toomin had always planned for Ellimist to lose the Game so Rachel would have a brief opportunity to damage Crayak for real.

If the Visser dies, is it a good thing because that's the Ellimist win condition, or is it a bad thing because it's the Crayak win condition, and the Ellimist win condition is peaceful coexistence with the Visser or somehow bringing him back to the light side?

Do we even care if Crayak wins or Ellimist wins? Because right now the only source that suggests an Ellimist victory is good is...the Ellimist, and he could easily lie.

****** I mean, all signs point toward Crayak's next move being to resume converting the galaxy to +paperclips+ terraria, starting with the Earth. But sure, the Ellimist could have lied about that.

But the thing that makes the stakes seem sufficient to me is, not the Game itself, but that it's over, and a megastructure just appeared out of nowhere, and where we had two gods, we now have one, who is apparently no longer bound by any restrictions. We no longer have a chessmaster god occasionally interfering with the plot; we have a final boss who the Animorphs should have no chance against.

Also, rereading, the Avatar mentioned once that the obstacle represented by the Vissor's ambition is the Game. That's phrased rather confusingly, but combined with what Player2 told the Vissor, and the circumstances of his disappearance, I'm not sure if Crayak took him out of play, or if it, like, raptured and assimilated him. In canon, when Crayak was tempting Rachel, he summoned the Vissor to test her powers against. Since Rachel just got powers courtesy the Ellimist, and the Vissor has been the big bad so far, I could see a merger of Crayak and the Vissor being the Final Form of the antagonist, or something in that category.

Really really really good.

An explanation for what the heck happened last chapter, an explanation for why the Chee couldn't see Rachel properly, an explanation for why Rachel came back wrong, an explanation for how both gods ended up playing a game they believed they would win.

And even more than that! The game between Crayak and the Ellimist might have ended last chapter, but it isn't over! Our heroes now have ~3 chapters to find a way to deal with Crayak, once and for all, with all of the Ellimist's resources but none of his planning ability and none of his protection. Their /only/ advantage being that Crayak doesn't know they exist and that he is still bound by the rules of the game.

...come to think of it, are the Animorphs bound by the game? Is only Rachel bound by it? The Ellimist transferred control of his account to her which suggests that she might only be able to make game-constrained moves. Huh. That changes things, I feel like. If the Ellimist with all his power and planning ability had no chance at all of defeating Crayak in 8 hours, what types of actions can the Animorphs even take that would do anything? Kicking Crayak out of our solar system isn't a solution even if it can be done and I have no idea how they'd even /start/ trying to kick him out of the galaxy or destroying him entirely.

I will be sitting on the edge of my seat for the next two weeks, as I have been for the previous two and the two before that and etc!

EDIT: Oh also! The disaster that befell Tobias and his subsequent relationship with Rachel??? This fits with canon where he became stuck in morph but there is no /way/ the Ellimist didn't know how morphing works differently in this universe. But the message also contained nothing about the timeline nonsense! Was that entirely Crayak? Was it just not important enough for the Ellimist to mention? Was it genuinely inconceivable to early Ellimist for some reason? Who knows! But now I at least know a possible starting point for the Animorphs' attempt to beat Crayak...

EDIT 2: Hmm. Rereading the Ellimist says Crayak used up lots of resources enabling the Chee to begin to ascend, forcing the successor-Ellimist to do all of the work preventing that ascension and thus being left open for a strike. Do we know /how/ Crayak used these resources? Even if Crayak is player 2, a message delivered to a random Andalite decades before it is relevant is a standard example of the types of subtle moves the players use. Any ideas what Crayak's most recent game moves were? Can anyone think of recent pre-ascension heavily godly stuff that happened? Cassie was presumably an Ellimist move, the Howlers would not have required lots of direction to reach Earth, was there anything else?

(Weakly) implied, but definitely true, and will be confirmed by retrospectives over the coming chapters: the mind-meld wasn't JUST them catching up on Rachel's memories; they also "debated" strategy inside the Leeran, and had disagreements, and made plans, and came to consensus on those plans.

** It's like, a summary of the /Ellimist Chronicals/, but if the author treated the K2 superintelligence like a K2 Superintelligence. And Crayak is simultaneously more concerning for his portrayal, not as slightly greater than the Ellimist, not as expelled by a K3 entity, but as the tendril of a K3 tiling agent intent on consuming the universe. ... And yet, somewhat less, because it feels like the Animorphs somehow have a chance against a physical god that scared another physical god into preemptively sacrificing itself for the faintest hope of victory.

And while the use of Rachel's memories to communicate is interesting as a tool by itself, there's also the little part where it covers so many fragments from her life as to reconstruct anything about her character that might have gotten discombobulated or forgotten along the way. It reminds us (and her) who she is, in a way that her thoughts on it post-message make clear were intentional. (And I am a sucker for both Tumin and Rachel's comments / thoughts on preservation / restoration and change, I guess.)

It's like, basically nothing actually /happened/, but it was so needed and helpful and satisfying and structurally precious that this is more welcome than acceptable.

** Man, maybe it's the residual alcohol in me from hours of day drinking earlier, but I'm just straight-up stunned by this update. I don't even know what to think. Rachel is kinda becoming the new Ellimist?! That's /cool/. Does she get to ascend? Are the final chapters going to take place over, like, hundreds of trillions of years? Are the god!Animorphs going to use the "there-is-nothing-that-cannot-be-unbroken" logic to bring back Ventura and all the people that got Howlered? I doubt it, since Toomin made it sound like it's pretty much just normal Rachel playing against Crayak now, with no intelligence or longevity bonuses or whatever.

More realistically, it sounds like Rachel had a pet named Appa that got hit by a car. Fresh lore! Good taste in TV, too.

Does anyone know how Toomin started going by "Ellimist?" In canon, Ellimist is basically just his gamertag, which he made up to sound breezy - maybe it's the same here, but I don't think I saw it in the chapter.

I was starting to get worried that the fic was going to end with some kind of super cheesy crossover with canon, but that possibility seems to have just dropped off significantly, so my breathing is back to normal. Now it looks more like Toomin tried to set things up in such a way that (something close to) the events from canon would happen, but something happened he didn't account for and the trajectory changed a little. The Escafil device didn't get invented, but the Iscafil device did; Tobias didn't get trapped, Rachel didn't start to date him... lots of other stuff too.

Interestingly, Toomin refers to Elena and not Eva, so whatever sequence of events he predicted couldn't have been the LITERAL canon book series. (Not that we couldn't have just assumed that. What kind of insane god would purposefully bring about a universe including Nartec?)

I'm wondering if he set up some kind of seizure or something for Elfangor and V1/Elena that was supposed to just-so-happen to arrange their neurons a certain way - like, for example, Elfangor's brain was supposed to end up exactly the same, but with the addition of the prophecy about the Animorphs. But the version of Elfangor's brain that Toomin prepped to paste in included a bunch of stuff from the state of the universe Toomin expected but which didn't come to pass, and that's why Elfangor has wrong memories. Same with Elena. Perhaps this also means the Time Lattice never existed.

Anyway. Love love love it. Can't wait for more.

Or maybe the actual hidden lore is that KA Applegate's mousepad said "trance" on it or something. Apparently all the alien words she didn't steal from LotR or Star Trek were just the result of her casting around for the nearest object and rearranging the letters in its name. For example, the Andalite word /nothlit/ comes from KAA looking out the window and seeing a Hilton hotel.

The intended interpretation (signaled both by the fact that the Ellimist acted through the avatar at all, and by the fact that its appearance was substantially less graceful than under other circumstances) is that Crayak was holding the Ellimist back---blinding it, and then restraining it, until ultimately it had no other choice but to manifest via the extremely slow and clunky tool of the avatar body.

Hence its confusion, then epiphany, then sudden takeover.

Perhaps he could have arranged things so Crayak would be opposed by a pantheon of gods instead of one going it alone.

And maybe the "pantheon of gods" thing is how the Animorphs can still come out on top. Toomin doesn't believe that Rachel can truly fill the void left by the Ellimist's death, but who says there has to be only one Ellimist?

** State of the narrative recap:

Questions answered in this chapter:

What was going on with Rachel? How and why is she special, and why has she been out of commission for the last 12 chapters?

What are the Ellimist & Crayak exactly, and what do they want?

What happened last chapter? Did Crayak win? (Yes, but actually, no)

Questions still unanswered:

Something fucky is going on with the timeline. What's the deal with Marco's mom, Elfangor and Tobias, and other references to the canon versions of events? (Notably, canon is much softer on the sci-fi hardness scale, meaning a satisfactory explanation has that much more ground to explain.)

Questions introduced in this chapter: What are a group of kids going to do with Toomin's power before Crayak notices he hasn't won?

Questions I am despairing will be answered at all: What the hell is a Leeran anyway? Why are they not mentioned in the mind meld? Leeran controllers/morphs are mentioned, so presumably they have some sort of brain and consciousness, but where did it go? That one froggy dude must have seen a lot since being kidnapped by the Visser...

Questions I really super duper hope will be answered with no:

Is that the end of V3? That arc does not deserve to end in ‘poofed away as part of tidying up the toys after playtime'. I know he'd rather die than live with a blade at his throat, but you can't just give a speech about pulling gods into fishbowls to drown them and then die without so much as a parting line.

*** Nah, that was Crayak doing a sneaky and arranging for V3 to agree to the Chee's unlocking, which is something he wouldn't have done otherwise. Or at least that seems far more likely to me.

We know that Crayak was pulling strings to get the Chee unlocked and thereby force the Ellimist into checkmate, and I can't imagine how Toomin could have taken control of the avatar on multiple occasions without either player noticing. And given the incredibly subtle tools that he had to work with, time constraints, and his need to stay under the radar from both active players, I would also be surprised if he managed to repeatedly manifest his own independent copy of the avatar without gathering notice either.

But on the other hand, it's also unclear what Crayak's uses of the avatar look like from the Ellimist's perspective. We don't know if the use went undetected entirely, or if E knows it happened but wasn't able to figure out what the endgame of those manifestations was. After all, C went through great pains to make both the message and its delivery as seemingly disconnected from the critical moment as possible. And while E probably spent time and resources looking into the matter, there's only so much that can be spent without consequently leaving other parts of the gameboard neglected and vulnerable.

** Ok I fully admit I was one of those people who were getting real bothered by the lack of agency that the main characters were experiencing. As the story progressed it moved from:

- 'Save your home town from an alien invasion'

to

- 'Save the world from an alien invasion'

and then with added sidequests

- 'Try to save more than just humanity'
- 'Get yanked around by one or both gods (repeatable)'

and the latter sidequest eventually kind of swallowed up everything else like V3 spreading throughout the galaxy. There's a few writers out there who get so caught up in their own clever ideas that they absolutely botch the conclusion of a story. I wasn't sure if this story was going to run into the same problem.

Well.

I'm blown away by this chapter, truly. As many others have pointed out, this was hinted and foreshadowed at, and it doesn't feel like a complete wtf development. I mean, I'm wtfing, but how we got here makes sense. I'm reminded of this snippet from Chapter 36:

#+begin_quote
  “If you were seeking to destroy all life on Earth, you might first create an industrial society of intelligent beings capable of doing the job thoroughly, rather than risking a quicker, more haphazard solution,” the creature said. *“Such a plan might look eerily similar to, say, a plan for human ascension---right up until the critical moment. You wouldn't ordinarily expect two plans with opposite outcomes to strongly resemble one another [...]"*

** Now that I've had the time to let this chapter settle in my mind I've realised one thing that has left me disappointed...

One of the things I've loved about this series is the different characters' perspectives on their sense of self, and what it means to be "me". Especially in the case of Rachel and the Visser, but the Yeerks themselves (shards and coalescions), the Marclones, Helium, Garrett, Tobias/Maninho, Jake and his black box, Cassie and her I-only-exist-because-the-gods-wanted-me-to-exist-at-this-exact-moment... Every perspective is interesting.

I was looking forward to hearing Toomin/The Ellimist's perspective on their sense of self. His letter to Rachel indicates some seriously interesting perspectives, not least of all because of his self-sabotage to become lesser on purpose...

** Damn. The ways this story echos the canon continues to be my favorite part of it. Here rachel and toomin share their first and last true conversation, as or right after one of them falls.

Other thought: this chapter reminded me a lot of the crystal society trilogy, in particular the focus on first-mover advantage. The battle necessarily begins before first contact, and with super intelligences like these, it would seem the battle necessarily ends (is decided) before first contact.

I felt really sorry for toomin. The existential horror of seeing the unstoppable beast approach, the repeated death-of-self, the instinct to desperately fling his children away to safety. I wonder if I'd feel differently about him without the canon story to back this up, but I think his characterization was nailed without feeling repetitive.

Also holy shit I just realized father killed toomin's body, and crayak cost him his mind, so both times he was “destroyed” by that initial entity's subroutines/parts. The poetry of it is rly hitting me

  This, too, is allowed by the rules of the game. There are a trillion trillion pieces, and all of them significant, their interactions governed by a shifting web of causality as delicate as a neutrino and as old as time itself. The web may be touched---nudged---shifted---once in an epoch, or possibly twice, a single strand may be snapped. Any more than that, and the game is forfeit. The players dance in slow infinity, calculating the fractal geometry of self-fulfilling prophecies, anticipating the impact of anticipated acts, and acting in reaction to events far in the unfixed future. Thus do cause, effect, and chaos mix, until even all-seeing eyes begin to miss things. There is always error, after all, and it is a chief characteristic of error that it is random---it being reliably willing to cancel itself out, it may safely be ignored. One can only go so many places beyond the decimal point before one is wasting resources more wisely spent elsewhere---a waste one's opponent will spot, and convert into advantage in accordance with the rules.

Here--all the way back in Interlude 2--we see Toomin arranging for Rachel's creation. And, further, we see both the Ellimist and Crayak assume that since neither of /them/ are responsible, then the event must be unintended. Precisely as planned.

There's something poetic about the fact that as the Animorphs waltzed in Crayak and the Ellimist's game, so too did Crayak and the Ellimist waltz in Toomin's last-ditch strategy. And now three layers have collapsed into one: there is nobody manipulating Crayak's game any longer, and the Animorphs have been lifted up to fight him on the closest they'll get to even ground.

  Centuries adrift, in the cold and the dark, my eye fixed upon the distant light of the nearest star, my first and final hope. Centuries of silent vigil, alert for any disaster, my fear throttled by ruthless caution. Once, a rock drifted past, its gravity tugging me ever so gently off course, and in the moments that followed I had no choice but to carve myself in two, sending half of my soul tumbling into the abyss to nudge the remainder back on track. I didn't know---couldn't know---what had been lost in that instant, how much of myself I had forgotten.

#+begin_quote
  It called itself Father. I never fully understood where it had come from, who or what had built it. It had crash-landed---was broken, or incomplete---seemed to be less than half of itself, with no memory of its beginnings. But it was powerful enough. A mad god, a half-conscious wreck of a machine following the incoherent exhortations of a piecemeal program. It drew us in, as it had drawn in thousands of other ships over the centuries---ensnared us, absorbed us, buried us in its twisted simulations, playing us off against its millions of other victims.
#+end_quote

But then again, the remainder of the sequence in Ch. 34 seems to describe Crayak dyson-ing that same star, using it as fuel to overtake the galaxy.

And on a related note:

#+begin_quote
  An ephemeral web of light, stretched across the infinite black, every line taut and graceful and still, and then---

  ---no---

  ---a twitch, a tug, as of something pulling, something crawling, something from beyond the deepest, farthest shadows---

  ---NO---

  ---a nightmare, an unimaginable horror, clawing its way inward, unseen, the web trembling from its weight, warping, twisting, tearing---

*** <3

The DreamMovie exposition only happened since the blue box blew up and she started convulsing. She was convalescent before that because the ur-Ellimist had set her up to have a bad reaction to being revived, which reshaped her physical brain in real subtle ways that would successfully be triggered into a memory cascade by the blue box's destruction.

** Option 1: reunite Crayak with it's cast off half. This would require a a couple things to work at all. The first is that Crayak would have to want to reunite with it, to perceive the act of cutting that half away as damage that it still would like repaired even after all this time, and knowing that accepting the code back into itself would likely change it's values. The second is that doing this would actually be a win condition of any sort. If all that this gets is Crayak saying, "thank you, you're conversion into monuments to my progenitor species will now proceed slightly more efficiently." then it's not really a win. The missing half would have to somehow make Crayak a friendly aligned AI. There's two facts I would point to that might indicate this to be the case. First, the event which lead to the half being cast away in the first place, Crayak was weak and alone. It had built an incredibly delicate ladder in a desperate attempt to reach a star and the promise of energy. This tells me it did not simply eat it creators and repurpose their infrastructure to it's unaligned ends. That sort of story would have left it with far more resources to start it's dyson sphere

There was a line from way back that always kinda niggled at me. When the avatar first appeared to the Animorphs, at the yeerk pool to save them under the direction of the Ellimist it said a thing. " it's my turn, and events have conspired to give me unusual freedom of movement." It was amusing to me because causing events to conspire just so in order to achieve a desired outcome is exactly Ellimist's thing. I didn't pursue the line of thought very far though, lacked time/inclination, so I didn't see this coming. I kinda wish I had spent more time puzzling this out. I'm not sure I could have figured it out though, My thoughts on the matter of the game were derived from a plot point in the Ellimist chronicles. The Ellimist is the first to ascend there and could have just won the war with Crayak, but he didn't. Instead he allowed to also ascend because otherwise it would be lonely to be god. Not very rational of canon!Ellimist. But maybe r!Ellimist rhymed. I would have guessed that the game was Ellimist's alternative to destroying Crayak because fundamentally Ellimist did not want to destroy others and would rather create harmony between them. So, the exact opposite of how things turned out.

Still, there is one last thing to puzzle out. How will the Animorphs defeat Crayak?

Option 1: reunite Crayak with it's cast off half. This would require a a couple things to work at all. The first is that Crayak would have to want to reunite with it, to perceive the act of cutting that half away as damage that it still would like repaired even after all this time, and knowing that accepting the code back into itself would likely change it's values. The second is that doing this would actually be a win condition of any sort. If all that this gets is Crayak saying, "thank you, you're conversion into monuments to my progenitor species will now proceed slightly more efficiently." then it's not really a win. The missing half would have to somehow make Crayak a friendly aligned AI. There's two facts I would point to that might indicate this to be the case. First, the event which lead to the half being cast away in the first place, Crayak was weak and alone. It had built an incredibly delicate ladder in a desperate attempt to reach a star and the promise of energy. This tells me it did not simply eat it creators and repurpose their infrastructure to it's unaligned ends. That sort of story would have left it with far more resources to start it's dyson sphere. It seems more like the sort of thing that would happen if it was, if not truly aligned, then at least constrained in it's ambitions. Until some disaster befell it and it had to flee on a rickety life boat to preserve itself. The second is that Father never tried to expand into a giant universe conquering video game playing space fungus. This suggests that something in code that ended up on that planet wanted to not tile the universe.

One issue is why neither the Urmillist nor the Ellimist could have figured this play out. The Urmillist stated that he did not know where Father's guiding code came from, and it may simply be that in the nine hours he had to prepare checking to see if the mysterious box that made him what he was had the same programing language as the Crayak was not possible/not thought of. The Ellimist had more chance to notice, simply from being in contact for longer but at that point had been altered to follow through with the plan. Additionally hiding their source codes from each other to prevent being predicted would be a very obvious thing to make sure to do. It might be that by chance, true chance this time, not "all according to keikaku" chance, the fact that Jake had that dying yeerk tissue dream way back when and now has access to the Urmillist's story via Rachel and the Leeran the Animorphs can put these facts together where a pair of gods had been blinded to it.

Option 2: Play Sans victory. If Crayak really has drawn down it's account to nothing and has to wait for Rachel to take her turn then Rachel could in theory just never take her turn and let the game continue forever. This is almost certainly not it, in addition to the Urllimist's message explicitly stating that the arbiter cannot hold Crayak forever without a competent enough opposing player it is the sort of thing he could have just said to do in the message. On the other hand by mentioning it I get to do a pun, and no matter how painful they are I am always a sucker for punishment.

I can't think of another option at the moment, Also is this too many words? It always seems like I spend 90% of my time lurking internet communities and then when I write something it's too many words.

*** I really like the idea of recombining Crayak and Father to correct Crayak's alignment. Father's whole "study people to learn friendliness" schtic succeeded in that Toomin just installed his values, effectively repairing the missing part.

I don't think it will work, though. It feels narratively weird, but there's also the question of Crayak's value drift, and also what happened to V3. It would be interesting if the Animorphs think of this, only to discover that Crayak absorbed V3 into the slots Father came from. I'm not sure what a V3 / Crayak values merger would look like, but V3 has spent a lot of time worrying about values drift and personality change, etc, and has also been shown being skillful at negotiating with entities whose values you'd expect to oppose his goals.

If V3 remains relevant, then Jake's section of taking a lot of interest in Alloran is probably important. I mean, that could have been Alloran's /Worm/ interlude, since he merged with V3 during that very chapter, but the way it was written makes it seem like it's important. Like, this is Jake's Black Box™ picking up on something he can use later, while V3 was simultaneously concerned about the Alloran-Esplin merger. It seems possible that this is going to be crucial in some way, because Crayak on its own might be willing to accept the change from reuniting with his "determine friendliness" half, but V3 would refuse, and if V3 is still a major player, I see there being no victory without solving him.

But Alloran's main power throughout the book has not been his tactical genius. It's been his ability to confuse the brain parasite that has root access to his mind. Esplin can't tell what Alloran's been up to ever since he went quiet, and then they merged, and it's even more confusing. And Alloran can only be relevant in a narratively satisfying way if he's been made available to the protagonists ... which he was in one of Jake's most recent chapters. And another Jake chapter is coming up.

** Huh, yeah, there we go.

I never thought that Player3!Rachel was what was going on, since I couldn't see how things would get there. But this makes sense. And as much as I love Rachel being beyond prophecy I also love the Animorphs punching way above their weight class.

  But nothing made sense. Whatever game the Ellimist was playing was over our heads. I felt like an ant wandering around a chessboard, trying to figure out the rules when all I could see was colossal figures moving around me in inexplicable patterns.

Yeah, this definitely tracks. They have no idea what to do next or what victory even looks like, but that's just Tuesday for these kids. It's never stopped them from poking Crayak right in his stupid eye before, and I am so ready to watch them do it again.

  I must be clear, lest you misunderstand me, and develop false hope:

  This is not a plan.

  This is not a prophecy.

  There is no preordained path to victory.

This is too next level for me.How am I supposed to win against the Crayak, if I don't know his win condition? Or the action space or the rules of the game?

*** My understanding is that the Game is over, Crayak won, and the Game was just a distraction to keep Crayak from eating the universe. The Animorphs have until Crayak unplugs to use what they know about the Arbiter to defeat Crayak. Since V3 just vanished, and was promised a gift that might take time for him to get use to, I'm guessing we need at least one more chapter before we have enough information to come up with a solution.

So we either need Crayak to break the rules before he realizes they still apply, or ... Hmm. The magnitude of changes was one of the rules, wasn't it? Maybe Crayak's already screwed itself over without realizing it, because Rachel inherited the Ellimist account... but I doubt it. That'd be both convenient and would deagent the characters.

(One thing I noticed on reread, that I somehow missed in spite of it being mentioned at least 3 times, is that Erek is currently disassembled and serving as the shielding for V3's local vessel. If being disassembled means Erek wasn't eliminated when the Ellimist removed the Chee, he could plausibly be brought back into play. Though, whether that's as a robot avatar for V3, or because Rachel resurrects him for mundane firepower, I can't guess.)
