** Ok, things are starting to come together now. First off, what does "Rin" mean when she says that shes everywhere? Clone technique obviously but there is no way that with a normal clone technique someone could hide from all of Konoha, especially with the Hyuga around. If only there was some foreshadowed way to use genjutstu on someone without having a physically present body. Kotoamatsukami? Maybe, or...\\
"Dan was known as the Ghost of Konoha because of his spirit transformation technique, which allowed him to project his spirit and even possess the bodies of his enemies. Orochimaru wanted that technique" -Tsunade CHP 39 This seems like a good fit for what we're seeing, with key figures everywhere being possesed by the spirit tranformation technique (re-read last chapter and you'll see that possession and genjutsu are basically the same thing). The members of the Yamanaka clan, to have the spirit cast a tiny chakra interference field around their head, while manipulating them subtly to ensure they can never get around the field. Hiashi Hyuga, to ensure that the Hyuga don't fill the gap the Yamanaka are leaving. Chiyo and Kakashi, to let Orochimaru get a hold of Kakashi's sharingan. The biggest problem is the question of how this technique is being applied, if we assume that the same rules for all of genjutsu apply for this technique then it seems like the defense is to simply flare your chakra, which is going to happen in the middle of a fight anyway, the fact that the spirit transformation technique could allow you to posses people even if your body/clone body is far away helps with this somewhat, but there are too many sharingan/byakugan users out there for you to reliably hide with this technique. That problem seems to favor the kotoamatsukami answer somewhat, if you assume that the kotoamatsukami cannot be dispelled, but that is quite the assumption to make. Of course if I was using this technique I would try and put a seal on my targets body or clothes and use that to possess them repeatedly, but who knows if that's even possible (though if it is possible it suddenly becomes A LOT more suspicious that missing-nin slash out their headbands). The other problem is that this theory suggests that "Rin" really is everywhere, which makes genjutsu pretty crazy strong, with her possessing numerous clan heads, and incredibly powerful ninja. This has become a lot less improbable to me recently, but this is still a knock against the theory.

On the subject of the power of genjutsu in this world, I'd like to note that this world finally makes sense to me, I was so confused for a while, I just didn't understand how this world could work with no clear defense against the OP OP genjutsu. How was the world not dominated by mind readers, how were the yamanaka clan the only mind readers to have prominence, it didn't make sense, even if you restrict genjutsu to mind reading and line of sight, things which it's been shown in the story to be able to do explicitly, it's still crazy powerful. Silly me, the author literally told us the only true defense. "The most important skill for any ninja to possess is the ability to remain hidden: Your foes cannot fight you if they do not know you exist, nor uncover your secrets if they are not aware of them" If you're unable to do that, well... "Poor Kakashi. You've been used and controlled by so many people, who can blame you for being unable to remember?" It makes me wonder about whether the hokage has some defense, since there was an assassination attempt against him not too long ago, I think the solution might be limited shadow clones, e.g. create a shadow clone that only has a certain portion of your knowledge, and only returns a small amount of knowledge/chakra, to prevent infection by proxy.

The next question is, what does "Rin" want with Naruto? There are two very good reasons to believe that someone has been setting Naruto up on at least 2 occasions, first is this line from "Rin" "I'm in the hospital too, just as I'm in the Hyūga compound and the Uchiha district" The hospital is obvious, the Hyuga compound I've covered, but what are they doing in the Uchiha district, who is even there other than the sand siblings, Naruto, and Lee? (is sasuke nearby?) Which brings us to the next point, how the hell did Temari and Kankuro even find Naruto? It wasn't like they just stumbled onto them, they were clearly ready for a fight, what with their human puppets in tow. Thats occasion 1, occasion 2 is from a while ago. "He had his own team now, no matter how strange that thought seemed to him, and he knew that he had to protect them even if it killed him." lulwut Kakashi? do you seriously not remember leaving them to die against a stronger opponent back in the land of waves? Obvious point is that he left them to die in the land of waves to due the influence of genjutsu, but why? If "Rin" or anyone else powerful enough to put a genjutsu on Kakashi wanted Kakashi's team dead there are much better ways of doing it (even while staying incognito) then letting Haku handle it. Thinking it through, I've got two hypothesis as to why "Rin", wants to mess with Naruto: option 1 is that "Rin" wants to groom Naruto, by providing him a stream of opponents at the correct battle level, letting him become stronger for some purpose. Option 2 is that "Rin" wants to force Naruto to the brink, getting him to release the nine-tails like he almost did after his fight with Haku. Pit him against too strong of an opponent and he'll die too quickly, but against someone of the proper battle level he could have enough room to release the nine-tails without dying, which might be necessary to "Rin"'s plan for some reason.

If you couldn't tell from my way too big comment, I freaking loved this chapter. Absolutely amazing job. The battles continue to reach an absolutely absurdly high bar of quality, Kakashi's section was brilliantly creepy. If all this story was was an incredible Rational Mystery story it would be good, but somehow Sophronius keeps raising the bar on themself with great writing in nearly every category.

*** Nice catch re: the spirit transformation technique! I didn't notice this at all but it seems like the sort of hint Sophronius would drop.

Except, does that mean Oro gave it to Pain when he joined Akatsuki or that he's still working with them in this fic? Rin and Pain were a couple or something in canon and there's this line which seems pretty suggestive:

  “I'm in the hospital too, just as I'm in the Hyūga compound and the Uchiha district. Wherever pain and misery exist, there you'll find me waiting.”
#+end_quote

Regarding Kakashi, I wasn't thinking of him as leaving Team 7 to die in the waves arc, but trusting them to survive. After all, he at least tried to trade the sharingan for their safety. Was your reading different?

** I think I mentioned before that I use music to get in the right mood when writing a chapter. Sometimes, the process of finding the right music can take hours, and if I don't find anything I just can't seem to get anything done. When I do find something that fits, I can listen to it for hours until it keeps playing in my head long after I stop writing. I don't usually remember what I wrote each chapter to originally, but in this case, I edited the second scene to the incredibly addictive [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIU5e7lSH1g][can you dig it]] soundtrack from Iron Man 3. By contrast, the ending scene was written to much of the Planescape Torment soundtrack, especially [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6oLK4m6iKs][Deionarra's]] eerily haunting [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUt84LyH2JI][theme]].

*** Right? This is really well-written and interesting, but this practically feels like schadenfreude-porn with how horribly everything is going for our protagonists. I thought it was bad enough when half of naruto's friends and mentor had merely died, but instead they have the Fate Worse than Death ending going for them. And a not insignificant portion of the blame (when it comes to the named characters' suffering, anyway) lies on Naruto for daring to try to cooperate with outsiders.

**** I get what you mean. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy][Darkness induced audience apathy]] is very much a thing, and it's bad. Things are not actually as dark as it looks though. Previously, four of Naruto's friends were believed to be dead. In this chapter, three of them turn out to be alive, and two of them are freed thanks to the heroic efforts of Naruto. That's certainly not a fate worse than death! And Tsunade is being operated on by Kabuto which yes, looks bad, but you also have to ask yourself why he would operate on a corpse (unless he's doing an autopsy). So on the whole of it, in this chapter one character died but several dead characters turn out to be alive, which is a net improvement on what we had before.

Also, yes it's true that Naruto's naivety made things worse, but he's also the one saving everyone through his efforts. Yes, he (maybe) gave Temari the idea to use poison gas, but he also warned Lee about it and saved his life twice this chapter. It's the same as last chapter, where Naruto's ideas saved Sakura's life several times over. For some reason Naruto only ever gets blamed for his mistakes, but never gets any credit for what he does right, both in the story and IRL :p

Anyway, I hope this doesn't turn anyone off from reading. If it helps, this arc will only last a few more chapters, and then it's the end of the "villain's win" part of the story. Think of this as the ending of "the empire strikes back", if that helps. A part of me also wonders if it feels darker because there's a week's delay between each chapter, since with a regular book you'd just read a few dark chapters and then you'd be on to the next part, but now you end up feeling bad for more than a month.

***** So, the major reason for feeling apathy for the story from my anecdotal perspective are the following reasons -

1. The fact that Tsunade got captured despite being an expert on poisons and being a top level ninja is a bit... jarring. How can a ninja of her level not recognize when a poison enters her body? It's not death that audiences off, it's the loss of agency (unless of course, Orochimaru is a final boss level villain and this is the penultimate arc, which you seem to have confirmed). Similarly, not having any POV chapters from the powerful people's side. A Sarutobi, or Danzo or Ibiki POV chapter interspersed between these chapters would've kept some hope alive in the audience.

2. Lack of real "victories" for the heroes' side. Gaara getting defeated was the only time I had a "FUCK YEAH HOLY SHIT GOOD JOB" moment. And even that was undercut by Naruto's realization of what he did, which again, shifts the tone to be depressing...

3. The lack of any sort of hope. In stories like these, you always have a sliver of hope that keeps the readers reading the story.

As in your example of Empire strikes back, it's Luke that keeps you watching the movie even after everyone is captured. You have that hope, that even if he is not ready, he can at least save his friends. This hope is dimmed throughout the last part, but never completely extinguished, and the last scene embodies this. They have lost Han, but they escaped to live another day. All is not lost.

Yet another series that does a similar thing is Game of Thrones. Ned Stark dies, but his children and bannermen are all alive, and they are pissed. The red wedding happens, which pushes the level of hope super low, but because Arya, Sansa, Jon Snow, Daenerys, Tyrion and several other interesting and intriguing characters are alive, and importantly, they are all POV characters. Their stories are still ongoing, the hope is never completely lost.

Here though? Konoha is said to be the strongest village, and every other village either seems to be their enemies or neutral to them. But the majority of the strong characters have been taken out, have no agency, or haven't shown up.

Every single POV character goes through absolute shit, so all hope seems completely lost (even though offscreen, it might not be) and that takes the audience out of the story.

This isn't the first time it happened, and the series has a tendency towards killing off major characters from canon, so eventually the audience reaction becomes "Oh, he/she dies? Huh, ok". Instead of shock, or awe, or sadness, there is just apathy. There has to be a balance. There has to be hope. Something to strive towards. Some sort of foreshadowing for cavalry arriving to save the day. Without any hope, audience investment is lost.

My two cent solution would be to see a POV on one of these "cavalry" members. Whoever is trying to patch up Konoha's defense. Seeing them go through tribulations as well, but not end the chapter on hopelessness. Seeing the defense finally come together, so that the audience has some hope of getting through the event.

****** Thanks for the feedback. I think you hit the nail on the head when it comes to the lack of "fuck yeah!" moments. I already knew people liked the Naruto vs Gaara chapter best (it has the highest number of upvotes by far), but I always assumed it was just because they really liked the fight scene. Now it makes a lot more sense.

I think the mistake I made is that I looked at the story from a too 'logical' perspective, ironically enough. There were good things happening as well as bad things throughout this arc, I thought, so what's the problem? But when you put it like that... I think the problem is that there are events which are 100% bad, and there are events which are a lot better than you'd expect, but there are almost no moments that are 100% positive. A story needs highs and lows to be effective, and the highs are just not as high as the lows are low, in other words. Sakura kicking Kabuto's ass is awesome, but then Oro shows up right after. Kakashi is awesome, but then he basically draws vs Chiyo, Naruto saving Kiba and Choji is awesome but then Kakashi's downfall happens right after. Or it could be more because the bad things happen right at the end of each chapter, which causes it to end on a depressing note each time.

It's strange though, because GOT or Worm never really had unambiguously good moments either. Arya remains alive as you say, but was she ever hopeful again? No, she just goes darker and darker as the story goes on, and the same is true for most of the others. On the other hand, I kinda stopped liking Tyrion by the end of book five because he became too hateful, and I kind of stopped liking Arya too for the same reason, so... maybe the right conclusion is simply that GRR Martin made the same mistake I did???

Maybe Worm is a better example? Worm was an unending darkness fest of darkwangst, and yet, I enjoyed it immensely. Perhaps the difference is that the MC was just so much of a badass, and frankly just more of a wish-fulfilment character, that it made enough of a difference. In other words, you can have impossible odds as long as the main character somehow always manages to come out intact regardless, but impossible odds + realism simply don't mix as well.

​

​

Btw, regarding your first point: Tsunade didn't get poisoned, she literally just drunk herself unconscious because she's Tsunade and there's a reason Shizune wouldn't let her near alcohol. Girl's got issues. :p

Sarutobi did get poisoned (reportedly), but there's precedent for that in canon as well: Jiraiya, who is is easily as strong, got poisoned by Tsunade and was useless for most of his fight against Orochimaru. So it's simply not the case that powerful characters in Naruto are never caught off guard. Think about the way Orochimaru was originally beaten by Sasuke. That could have been a scene in NTBS, and I wouldn't even have to change much to make it fit.

There were plenty from both series.

GoT -

1. Tyrion's defense of King's Landing.
2. John Snow cutting peoples' heads off.
3. Joffrey's wedding.
4. Tyrion's trial and the privy aftermath.
5. Daenerys vs slavers.
6. Pretty much any dragon vs shitty people scene.
7. Culmination of Arya's training and some of her murders.

Even some of the "bad guy wins" scenes in GoT are compelling because of the shock value you get from that chapter, as these events are usually confined to one chapter after which we move on to a different POV and a different tone. Red wedding, Kingsmoot, Jon "Caesar" Snow etc. are all compelling chapters, but they don't extend beyond that one.

#+begin_quote
  Arya remains alive as you say, but was she ever hopeful again?
#+end_quote

She did become badass after that. She has a list of people she wants to kill. She has objectives. Things to look forward to, even if they are rage induced. Which balances things. Agency is what matters. And Arya has plenty of agency right now.

As for Worm, it was a little different. Things went to absolute shit and continued to go further and further down, and I'm 100% sure this affected the ability to care for any audience that were reading those as they came out.

But characters always retained their agency. They were always thinking of what to do in the upcoming shit situation, so even if the situation kept getting worse, you kept reading because they characters could still "do stuff". Agency.

Also, it had an immensely satisfying payoff with Khepri. The ending was what it had been building up towards. And for me at least, it delivered. Hopefully you have some satisfying chapters coming up as well :D

Agency man, agency is always what keeps stories from becoming too depressing.

1. Naruto was winning but then his chapter ended with a suicide attack cliffhanger so there was no "FUCK YEAH" moment.
2. Kakashi lost all agency at the end of his chapter (after a potential "FUCK YEAH" moment).
3. So did Sakura (Another potential "FUCK YEAH" moment undercut. This chapter in particular was 100% guilty of apathy inducement because we were hoping for that ONE victory after a series of things going to absolute shit. Doubly so because it was actually a tough fight and Sakura was pushed to the edge and clawed out her victory... only to be suddenly undercut).
4. So did Shikamaru.
5. So did Tsunade (even though she wasn't POV).
6. And one remaining character whose POV was shown was preparing to lock themselves in (removing them from the board, and limiting their agency).

There was no such series of chapters in either worm nor GoT, where chapters continuously showed POV characters losing agency at the end of their POV.

I'm assuming the characters with agency are all "behind the scenes" types so you're reluctant to show their POV (Sasuke, Danzo, Ibiki and Sarutobi come to mind), so hopefully we will have future chapters where they finally decide to get involved. I just hope the upcoming awesome moments are awesome enough to balance the scale of sheer depression we are left in after this series of chapters :)

You might be using a different definition of "unambiguously good" than I had in mind. :p

Yes, watching bad guys get what they deserve is satisfying, but I meant that good very rarely triumphs in an optimistic way in GOT. For example, it's nice that Joffrey dies, but then Tyrion gets blamed for it and the story only gets darker as a result - just like in NTBS!

I get what you mean with the lack of "fuck yeah!" moments though - I think I just need to write more scenes that are satisfying from the perspective of the POV, even if the POV is not really a hero, because the reader's experience depends on what the POV character feels rather than what is seen as good or bad from an outsider's perspective.

> Agency man, agency is always what keeps stories from becoming too depressing.

I'm not sure 'agency' is the right word. Sure, the good guys are on the back foot right now, so they're much more reactive than usual, but they still live or die as the result of their own choices and actions. Shikamaru fails because he didn't prepare for the coming conflict despite Naruto's warnings, Sakura survives because she did, and Kakashi fails because he refused to accept help.

But yeah, it's true that their efforts are undermined somewhat because the enemy is actively working to prevent their actions from making a difference in the grand scheme of things.

This is very true. I am very careful not to show certain characters too much because, well, then there wouldn't be any mystery left to resolve. The story needs to have multiple suspects for the mystery aspect to work, and it just feels cheesy to show too much from their perspective without revealing what they really think and plot and do...

(I insist that Naruto at the very least does have agency though, since quite a few events of the plot are happening strictly because of him. They're just not all what he intended.)

Anyway, next chapter will feature several of the characters you mention, so hopefully you'll consider that a plus. But uh, fair warning, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll like what they do :P

#+end_quote

I'll use this scene as a small comparison -

- Joffrey dying is such a great moment for the audience, because he was such a hated presence both in the story and out of it, and it came after he was being an absolute asshole at his own wedding. Tyrion getting blamed for it immediately afterwards, at the time, felt like a misguided rage from the part of Cersei, and we never really see if the Kingsguard actually did arrest Tyrion until a couple of chapters later. Because this chapter was about the high point of watching Joffrey die, so even Cersei's rage filled screams simply add to the schadenfreude of the scene instead of undercutting it, and the audience gets to bask in the glory of that good thing happening, just for that one moment.

Compare to NTBS, you have Sakura, Shikamaru, Kakashi and Naruto all losing consciousness at the end of their chapters, at the mercy of their enemy. In my audience perspective, I feel like there wasn't any need to linger in their POV until they completely lost consciousness (which makes them completely at the mercy of the enemy with zero chance of escape, and thoroughly and completely crushes the hopes of the audience).

- For e.g. if you ended Sakura's chapter with her simply sensing Orochimaru and feeling that fear, and perhaps ending the chapter at the "kukuku" laugh (thus still retaining the audience hope, at least for a little while). It certainly was a powerful moment, but because it happened just after a much needed win for the good guys, that entire badass FUCK YEAH previous scene gets undercut. Sakura did indeed learn from Naruto, and survived, but she still ends up at the mercy of the enemy.
- Same with Kakashi, we could've simply cut away from the scene just after Kabuto's final dialogue "leave it to the pros", which would leave some hope for the audience ("oh shit, what's going to happen?!"). The last line of the chapter simply confirms that Kakashi has indeed been defeated, crushing the hopes of the audience completely and leaving them with an absolutely depressing result, instead of curiosity about what happens next or a faint bit of hope.

Cliffhangers are cliche, but they are used super often because they still leave the audience with the hope that the hero can climb from the cliff next chapter.

  Shikamaru fails because he didn't prepare for the coming conflict despite Naruto's warnings.
#+end_quote

Not really what is conveyed in that chapter IMO -

- Sensible, logical patterns of attack. All of them would fail.
- Kankuro and Temari had watched them fight during the exams.
- What was worse, Naruto had gotten them to share some of their techniques.
- They would have counters ready for every one of them.

What the audience sees as the cause for the defeat of Shikamaru and his team are two things -

- The kids being super enthusiastic about showing off their techniques in the exams.
- Naruto's naivety (or was it Sasuke's manipulation?), trusting in the Sand village kids with their techniques even after /murdering their brother/.

Even when Shikamaru made all the right calls, he still failed [1]. Shino escapes thanks to the thing he got from Naruto (point made) but Tenten hadn't gotten hers yet, so she ended up failing.

#+begin_quote
  Sakura survives because she did
#+end_quote

Not sure if this feeling is properly conveyed to the audience IMO. She kicked Kabuto's ass and perhaps that is why Orochimaru took an interest in her, but at the end of her POV she ends up completely at the mercy of her enemy. So the audience feeling is that she made all the right calls, and still failed [2], because Orochimaru was always watching and so she was never going to win.

#+begin_quote
  Kakashi fails because he refused to accept help.
#+end_quote

Which is, again IMO, not properly conveyed to the audience. We had a whole chapter of Kakashi fighting a fight way above his pay grade, and trying his hardest to win. He didn't accept help here because he knew that regular Chuunin and Jounin would be no match for Chiyo and would just end up dead. It ends in [uncertainty], because we don't know if the technique worked or not. Next chapter, the start of his POV is awesome, as we can see that he has survived and Chiyo is contained for now, a Victory! Kakashi knows that he can't remove this poison, and neither can Chuunin gatekeepers or random doctors in the hospital, and says as much -

#+begin_quote
  "He found himself moving towards Tsunade's wing of the hospital. She had always been the only person who could cure Lady Chiyo's poisons"
#+end_quote

So what the audience sees is a veteran ninja surviving a really rough battle by the skin of his teeth, BUT... but.. he made a logical/rational choice and went to the only person that could help him. He made all the right calls. And still failed [3].

When you take all the right steps and still end up in failure, that is when you have no agency.

With that, hopefully you can see how the audience would see this triple whammy.

Hmmm. The problem with cutting the Oro scene short is that I would end up giving up on one awesome moment just to make another a bit better. I dunno. On the other hand, I could have easily made the Kakashi fight end on a high note. In the first draft, there was another scene right after from Chiyo's point of view where you see the effects of Kamui, but I ended up cutting it because it was unnecessary. But maybe if I had left it in the readers would have felt more satisfied, and more willing to accept that Sakura's victory was stolen from her in the next chapter.

Shikamaru sees is that way, sure, but if you read between the lines... he spent the entire fight arguing with and trying to correct his own team. He fails to convince Kiba because he never bothered to establish a relation with him, he has to correct Tenten's moves because he never showed up for the team training before, and in the end he never attacks Temari and Kankuro even once.

#+begin_quote
  So on the whole of it, in this chapter one character died but several dead characters turn out to be alive, which is a net improvement on what we had before.
#+end_quote

So is this confirmation that [character] dies at the end? (I can't remember whether there was some other death in the chapter. If so I'll be pretty embarrassed.) (Also: funny to see the author chime in that the chapter titled "Multitudinous Eclectic Horror" actually shows that things weren't as bad as they looked! ;) ) (Also also, people definitely just think things are too dark because of the update speed: you just need to release chapters faster and everything will be fine!)

I think I remember you saying a while back that the story was 2/3 complete, and your mention of The Empire Strikes Back seems to suggests the same. On the other hand, Oro taking Sakura seems like it'll require a longer runtime or a timeskip for it to really pay off.

Since it looks like you're in a mood to give out meta information, can you say anything about how much longer you expect the story to be? Or whether you're planning a shippuden-style timeskip?

I'm expecting the story to wrap up all of the important canon threads, and everything set up by so far, so I'm not worried about that. I just don't want this to end since I'm enjoying it so much.

--------------

You wrote in the last thread that you like setting it up such that "the fate of characters ultimately depends on whether they are able to overcome their primary flaw". If [character] did die, it's really depressing that their final test was failed in such a cursory manner.

******* Pretty sure Shino 'ported away with the ghetto flying thunder god scroll, and Shika effectively killed himself by overusing his clan's jutsu to let himself think faster. That chapter mentions brains turning to mush from overuse. Ironic that if he'd just given up and not overused the jutsu he might have survived.

​

Or maybe he did survive, but his other ninja skills are weak enough from his overreliance on his clan's jutsu that Kankuro didn't bother using him.

****** I confirm nothing! I also said that Naruto's friends were dead last chapter but are alive in this one, so you might be taking things too literally. Things sure don't look too good for Kakashi though.

There won't be any timeskip: I just don't think it makes sense to have all the major players do nothing of consequence for any serious length of time. Instead I prefer to suggest the passage of time between each chapter, so the characters feel like they're aging rapidly without skipping anything.

If you don't want it to end... good news! It turns out I'm terrible at brevity so the story will probably last quite a bit longer. Hard to be sure though, because we're really going off the canon rails from now on.

Regarding the final test: a big theme of Ntbs is that battles are decided by the time swords are drawn. So in this case, Kakashi fails his test not just because he doesn't ask for help in this one chapter, but because he ignored Naruto and couldn't change his worst instincts even when they were explicitly pointed out to him:

#+begin_quote
  Naruto glowered at him, not seeming to appreciate the humour of his last comment. “You know,” he said, “I think I've finally figured out why you're always late to our team meetings, sensei.”

  Kakashi raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”

  “Yeah. At first I thought you were just being lazy, but no jōnin would ever survive as long as you have by being lazy. So then I figured you must be trying to teach us a lesson somehow, and I thought I'd look at the expected result and assume that was your intended goal. I concluded that you were trying to teach us not to blindly trust authority, and to take responsibility for our own development.”

  Kakashi took care not to smile. “You may very well think that, but-”

  “But then I remembered to look underneath the underneath, and I thought to myself: What if all of that is just my attempt to guess what you want to hear, when you yourself might not really know why you do the things you do? So instead I asked myself which state of mind would make your actions the most likely outcome, and focussed only on what I already know.” He looked at Kakashi with uncharacteristic coldness. “So I'm gonna stick my neck out and guess that it's not just us but that you're late to all kinds of meetings, and that you had difficulty connecting with people long before you even had a team. And whatever bogus rationalization you came up with afterwards, whatever answer you claim to be the correct one, it's really just an excuse to avoid having to get close to the people you care about.”
#+end_quote

And more recently, in the last few chapters: He rejected Naruto's offer of Shadow clone support. Choza was right there and he sent him away. And right at the end, when he finally considered calling for help, he allowed Rin to convince him not to.

So yeah, call it instance #341 of Naruto being entirely correct when it comes to identifying crucial problems, yet entirely failing to convince anyone because he's too much of a brat about it :P

***** For sure, in a literal sense they're better off than they were, I meant "fate worse than death" in a tropey sense that they were forced to fight their own friends while a prisoner of their body.

As for Tsunade... I kind of just assumed she was either dead, about to die, or otherwise be puppetted? Like, just this last chapter has shown that any ninja specializing even in a medical-adjacent field (poisons) can reeeeeally mess with you if they have time to do so after defeating you. I figured the first thing Kabuto did was turn Tsunade into a quadraplegic and isolate her chakra network, haha. IMO there's no real reason for Tsunade to end up anything other than dead or 100% compromised, same with Kakashi.

I admit I was being uncharitable to Naruto's actions in general, the justu-sharing idea he had to begin with was relatively sound. But it's because he had the temerity to try to make bonds outside of the village/ingroup (as naruto's character core dictates) that he ends up screwing his friends over more than they would otherwise, which feels bad, man.

Don't worry about losing me as a reader, at least. I powered through Worm and Pact no problemo. But in terms of general darkness... wow chakra string puppetry is freaky as hell? It's kind of ridiculous you can even affect a person's speech through /strings/ but hey that's chakra for ya.

*** Give it a few more chapters- the first few put me off as well, but I think it's well worth it. It has my favorite characterization of Kakashi in any fic by far, and I love what the author's done with Naruto, though it took me a while to appreciate his character. The important thing to realize is that Naruto really is quite smart and usually correct... but he's bad at getting people to *think* he's smart, and so they don't listen to him. That realization helped me a lot.
