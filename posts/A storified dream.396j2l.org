Most of my dreams have plotlines. Occasionally, those plots include enough aspects of a full story that I try to write them out. I just woke from one, and finished trying to storify it at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_oIpJPCL1YWew-lDkL-WsGL_q3FcvBg8ImPJfke8aMg/edit]] ; I'm not sure I'm awake enough to have done well, but if it matters going in, its 1100 words seem to be [RT], [HSF], and [TH], though in a slightly more Philip K Dick fashion than Charles Stross.

Feel free to downvote this post into oblivion if I should have waited until fully waking up and reconsidered before posting it here. Or maybe use this as an excuse to post about dream narratives. Or to psychoanalyze me. Or whatever.


** I like that story. It's punchy.

** See, I kinda want to write down my dreams, but they always get poluted by semilucid demigodom as I'm waking up, turning them all into mary sue stories.

Say did I tell you guys about that time when the zombie/vampire apocolypse struck? Snoopy managed to hold them off just long enough for me to learn how to harness my sith lightening powers.

** Dreams are */weird/*.

Some rare dreams result in me simultaneously perceiving three separate events with different thoughts about each one which is how I imagine having three similar personalities would be like. It felt as more like I was three people narrating some guy's life since in those dreams we were very passive and didn't make any decisions. It's what I imagine a hive-mind to be like.

Other times I dream in a black-and-white comic book art style where the world is in three dimensions but everything looks drawn or animated. In similar dreams I sometimes interact with a character from my favorite cartoon TV shows (only cartoons for some reason and the dream where I rode Celebi over my bathroom sink was awesomely hilarious).

Other times I think I am someone else from a fantasy setting. There was a dream where I was Justin, a sword fighter literally walking next to a ship over an Ocean with swimming dragons (that was a sad dream when Hercules died). It's why I was convinced the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment was a possibility, because I have literally been another person. If my consciousness can be fooled into being someone else, then why can't my senses be fooled as well?

A few times, I was in an alien body with tentacles. I generally 'sit' in one place moving my tentacles around in what feels like jello. Sometimes I think I was a plant instead, but they seem so similar I can't tell which is which during or after the dream.

Once I even thought I was perceiving the world in 4-D where the extra dimension was color with I think black-blue as one direction and the opposite direction as red-white. Or was I seeing time as a fourth dimension of color? Very little happened in that dream.

I even experienced something like a non-linear perception of time where I dreamed about some events out of chronological order, but my actions made perfect sense at the time as well as when I woke up (for about as long as I could remember the details anyway).

I have woken up wondering who am I with total amnesia. I have wondered why my arms aren't on a different part of my body other than my shoulders. I have wondered why I was sleeping on the ceiling. I have wondered why my senses are off or why my body is different from how it should be. Usually I'm sorted in a few seconds, but I sometimes think the Matrix-Overlords are secretly changing my identity each day. I mean....of course I've always been [[/u/xamueljones]]. But...was I always [[/u/xamueljones]] yesterday?

I don't usually dream (or is that remember them when I wake up?) but when I do, they always come out /odd/.

Dreams are fascinating to me since they are the closest I can get to experiencing things normally impossible for me.

EDIT: For anyone curious, I've never had a nightmare. I've had dreams where I was being attacked or something horrible is happening to me, but I don't feel very much emotion in any of my dreams and the strongest ones are usually some sadness or happiness. I've had dreams where I should be scared, but I don't ever emotionally react until I wake up and by then it's not scary anymore.

EDIT2: I have never done drugs or drank more than two medium-sized cups of alcohol in one sitting.

*** Thanks for sharing!

My dreams usually take place in a mostly realistic world. Space isn't always perfectly euclidic, time can be very flexible, momentum doesn't really exist and water is a bit compressible.

The most fascinating dream of mine was one in which I aged. Slowly. I finished university, got married, struggled with my career, wasted a ton of time in fruitless projects, learned some useful skills in others, but always found happiness with my wife. All of that in almost real time: I remember living through thousands of individual days, countless hours with my family, different hobbies and projects, different cities, some funerals and traveling to at least a dozen countries on holiday. I had five grandchildren, and I saw two of them grow up to Kindergarden. Being old sucked because of the constant pain. It erodes you, makes you complacent. I fought the pain and the complacency every day, and felt victorious to see yet another sunset. Then, on some day, my wife died. It was so sudden and heartwrenching that I woke up. It was just another tuesday; I hadn't even slept longer than usual.

Today, 8 years later, I'm 30. My years of silent mourning for my dead dream wife are behind me, my life is on track, but I still sometimes get a dejà-vu to some memorable event from my dream life. I feel so much older than I really am, it's ridiculous. I found my inner peace; and there's very little that can shake me.

Oh, by the way - I've never done drugs. I've read that similar experiences could happen on LSD, but apparently my regular brain chemistry is freaky enough, so I won't touch anything that messes with it even more.

Also, I'm deleting this tomorrow because it's way too personal to be found online.

**** Ugh, I hate sad dreams like that. Whenever I get a sad one, it's always me hugging someone I love good-bye for the last time in bright sunshine. It's like a scene right out of a big-budget tragedy movie. I tend to hug my family/friends tightly after a dream like that.

Still better to have known bliss with someone you loved than not at all. I wonder if it would be ethical to have implanted memories of wonderful experiences that never happened?

Since we're discussing this on [[/r/rational]] and we love munchkining weird stuff like this, I have a few ideas. I'm sorry if I sound offensive suggesting ways to take advantage of a painful moment.

- Were you able to retain any of the skills you learned in the dream? I know it's unlikely, but I'm curious.

- Have you considered looking for someone similar to your dream wife? Since you already know (subconsciously) what kind of person you'd like to spend your life with, then you know what to screen for in potential partners.

- Is your dream wife similar to someone you already knew at 22? Maybe your subconscious is hinting at something.

I just realized something horrifyingly funny. Your dream wife is literally the woman of your dreams!

PM if you want to talk further in private. If you delete the above comment, then I'll delete this one as well tomorrow night.

You're really not missing out on much. I tend to feel monumentally /dumb/ after my nightmares, when I wake up and realize how Genre Blind I was being.

Except the annual one where a zombie bites me in the small of my back, and I feel the teeth and the cutting and... ugh. I don't know /why/ I have to dream that dream every March.

*** Wow.

My dreams are almost always mundane. Lots of the time they're just replays of IRL events, possibly with minor alterations.

When they're not mundane, they're always chase dreams. Usually I'm getting eaten by something or at least am in danger of being eaten by something (and then the dream resets partly or entirely and I have to try, try again) but in the last one I was being chased by a Sith Yeerk.

** It's a cool one shot and if you want to make a longer one I remember reading about a guy who read through his last dream "chapter" before going to bed and continued dreaming from there. I'm not sure if it works though.

** I've never wanted children, but I've always wanted a body capable of it. One night, I felt a child inside me. I could feel it kicking and its heartbeat alongside mine. I woke up feeling like I lost something.
