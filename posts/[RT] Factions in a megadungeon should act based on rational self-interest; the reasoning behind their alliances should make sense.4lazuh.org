** I detest many of the claims of 'realist' geopolitics, but surely the worst is that states /should/ have no friends, no loyalty to higher principles.

It is obvious even from recent history that in practice /most/ do not, but to conclude that this is the natural and morally proper way of international relations can and should be contested. To passively accept the status quo of physical and economic violence between states is to surrender moral agency as citizens of those states, or claim that that the moral worth of humans varies with the location of their birth.

*** I have a feeling that the aim is not to completely replace every depiction of politics with with dispassionate realpolitik (not exactly the term for this, but close enough). The author probably thinks that there is too much "good-aligned races are always allies against evil-aligned ones regardless of circumstances" situations occurring as the default. So they point out what's missing.

The point, I think, is not that realpolitik is good. The point is that it would emerge naturally in most political systems, at least to some degree, so it's weird for it to be missing in fictional worlds.
