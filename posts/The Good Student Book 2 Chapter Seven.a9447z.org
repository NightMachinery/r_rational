** Nic is getting increasingly devious and openly manipulative as the series goes on. Not necessarily in a cruel way or unreasonably but he is develolping a somewhat Machiavellian personality and projecting it onto everyone around him as well. He believes that others are using him and attempting to coerce him to act in a certain way because that is how he has been treating others.

**** I just reread a few of the last chapters from the end of book 1 as a refresher and then read book 2. So, as someone that just binged it (And read the chapter discussions here), I see a lot of complaints about Nic not changing and there being little character development. However, I think it's more apparent when you read it straight.

Nic goes from a passive person with little opinion about himself or his station. He is interested or devoted to his academic lifestyle. However, he has changed since the events of book 1.

He has lost his passion for studying and class. He is actively searching for something new to bring value to his life. Nic admits that he no longer wants what he has been allotted to in life. He doesn't want the boring, cushy, and safe desk job anymore. He is actively looking for a place in the adventurous, dangerous going-ons of Ranvar.

Though he doesn't outright admit it as far as I can tell, Nic is also tired of how people treat him. Dizzy brushes him aside and tries to use him to be involved in the situation. Simole treats him better and helps him but it is from a position higher than him. She has power and skill which intrinsically has her looking down on his ability. The Archmage, demons, and Winnum Roke all are trying to manipulate him.

Nic is, as he stated, tired of being the damsel in distress. He wants to have agency over the modicum of influence he has in his role in the situation of things. He is no longer willing to just be passive and be so insignificant. He has begun to plot himself and has started to treat other more along the lines of how they have been treating him. It is a kind of growing up, though a sad one where one loses their naivety and kindness.

Sorry for the wall of text but I felt like getting some of my thoughts out there after catching up.

#+end_quote

I think that's a maybe. I think it's purely circumstantial - he has bigger things to worry about at the moment and the focus has shifted from class to accommodate this.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Do you have any citation for this? I seem to recall him only recently mentioning, yet again, that he's not interested in being a mage for example. He's currently doing things mostly because he thinks he either has to do them to accomplish what he wants, due to his circumstances, or because it'll make things easier for what he wants. Throughout all this I've never gotten the sense he particularly enjoys or prefers this new life of adventure and mystery.

#+end_quote

That's a possibility - I'm just not sure how entirely likely it is. He's aware of Dizzy's motives, and doesn't seem terribly bothered by them - he still seems stuck on her. I think he's making the best of the situation by trying to use her in return. He might as well. As for Simole - well I don't know if there's any revolutionary there. That's been the case since the very beginning, and he's been aware of it for a very long time now. I highly doubt he has any particularly gnawing concerns about their dynamic.

I agree with the rest. I'm glad for it but still wonder why it took so long. For someone supposedly talented in learning, he's sure taken an extremely long time to adapt to his situation. Apart from that, this novel, for some reason, makes it difficult to discuss its characters and their motivations/relationships without immediate context. I don't know if it's because readers are left in the dark with intention but it always feels like I'm speculating.

****** Like I said, I just read the second book at once and what I'm saying comes from expressly stated thoughts in the series. Easy to forget when you're reading chapter by chapter but extremely obvious when you go through it at once.

#+begin_quote
  He had accepted that his original goal --- to get closer to Dizzy --- was no longer feasible. But the result of that was that he had lost a lot of his ardour for learning. His mind often wandered during classes, on flights of fancy of no consequence. Drifting and aimless.

  He lacked purpose. He needed purpose.
#+end_quote

My first point isn't circumstantial, in my opinion. This is in Book Two Chapter Two. it also has to do with my point on Nic looking for something to do with his life.

#+begin_quote
  I've decided it won't work to just sit and wait. Plus, I like it. Being involved in something big, even when I don't really know what's at stake. Maybe if I did I would be more scared. Ordinary life, working in a nice office, buying things to make myself more comfortable, it just feels a bit...”

  “Drab?”

  “I guess. Drab and dreary.”
#+end_quote

In regards to him no longer wanting to be a clerk. This is in Book Two Chapter Three.

#+begin_quote
  “You seem distracted,” said the voice in his head.

  “Yes. I'm trying to understand my place in the world,” said Nic.

  “That's not very difficult. It is whatever you want it to be.”

  “What if you don't know what you want it to be?”

  “Then it doesn't really matter, does it?”
#+end_quote

Nic speaking to Winnum Roke at night while he is being introspective in bed. More with him thinking about his new thoughts on life. Book Two Chapter Four.

#+begin_quote
  “I have no doubt you will try to deceive me at some point. Everyone does, if they think it is for a higher cause."
#+end_quote

Like I said, it isn't expressly stated but imo, Nic has been bringing up how people treat him and how he is viewed a lot more in Book Two. He is thinking about it a lot and the tone that I am getting is that he is a bit bitter about it and he doesn't like it. Book Two Chapter Four

#+begin_quote
  It was like they didn't even know he was there. No, it was worse than that. They knew he was there, awake, listening, but they didn't care what they said in front of him. His feelings were irrelevant because to them he didn't really have any. He wasn't even human, just a vessel they were deciding on how best to utilise.
#+end_quote

Nic's thoughts of how Simole and Dizzy are treating him in Book Two Chapter Six

#+begin_quote
  Even Nic could feel the pressure she exerted on her surrounding just by being present. More than before, he was almost certain. Had her father given her further training? Had Winnum Roke?

  The other students shifted and flowed out of her path without even realising it. They were students of the Ransom School, smart enough to recognise an insurmountable threat. Simole wasn't the only one of those the school contained.

  What was it like being so sure of yourself? Did it make you happy? Did it make you feel safe? Did it lead to arrogance and conceited disregard for the wishes of the mere mortals who crawled around at your feet?

  He needed her, even though it helped emphasise his own weaknesses.
#+end_quote

Nic's thoughts on Simole in Book Two Chapter Six. I get your point that that has been their dynamic but I think that Nic has been more clear about his uselessness recently and his own opinions have been changing recently. What he wants from life is different so, while he doesn't necessarily begrudge Simole, her strength and his reliance on her is just a sign of his own incompetence, which he wants to change.

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, you're right. In all likeliness, they've decided to join forces to keep an eye on me and prepare a suitable tactic for preventing me getting in their way. They probably assume some new catastrophe will befall us and I'll be in the middle of it, and they'll want to control, manipulate or coerce me into giving them full power of attorney over whatever small influence I might end up with. I don't think they trust me to handle it myself or have the good sense to let them take over without being forced to.”
#+end_quote

Like I said, I think Nic wants more personal power because he desires his own independence and agency without needing to be used and influenced by others. From Book Two Chapter One

#+begin_quote
  What Nic really feared was that he would have to be saved, again. A heroic knight in a nightie and pigtails bursting through the door in the nick of time. He had had quite enough of being the damsel in distress.

  His life at the centre of these infernal events never seemed to raise him up to the level of competent challenger. He was merely a pawn being moved around a board at someone else's behest. And rescued from certain annihilation the same way.
#+end_quote

From Book Two Chapter Eight. Nic has had the somewhat of a similar sort of dynamic with Simole and Dizzy and a lot of other characters since the beginning. He is smart but out of his depth and has a lack of skill/training. Especially when compared to chosen one Simole, trained her whole life Dizzy, powerful/experienced Archmage, and ancient power Winnum Roke. But after the events of Book One, he is getting tired of the dynamic.

******* Thanks for the references.

Taking these in whole I think helps illuminate one of my reoccurring problems with understanding this novel. Half the time I read nics confessions I'm baffled and the other half I'm shocked. I'm not entirely sure if I need my hand held more than some people but I don't have issues understanding things in worm or ward or mother of learning or pgte, and yet, what characters say seems to sometimes conflict with or go against what they do or act like. Other times it just comes out of left field or doesn't click for me at all. I think your penultimate quote is a somewhat ok example of this. When I read that the first time I was confused - is he joking, is he being facetious or childish? Is he somehow serious or is he just trying to make himself believe this, maybe in vain? Is this roke subtly affecting him? Is it just a new shift or an underlying issue bubbling up? What happened to past camaraderie proven loyalty through time spent together facing challenges, etc?

It just seemed like a really weird thing to say and somehow never really became clear what the intent was. The weird strain between all of them that somehow appeared in the beginning of the book seemed misplaced to me. No reasonable preamble for it to suddenly be there and now he's saying stuff like that - applicable to one of the other quotes regarding them as well, like he's suddenly unfamiliar with their personalities and teasing and is blowing it out of proportion. Is he supposed to become an unreliable protagonist sort?

******** I love this type of story telling personally. I hate it when stories have a ton of hand holding, repeatedly telling you the conclusions or what is happening. That isn't how conversations work in real life. Often, the best way to do it is to give the hints and imply the conclusion. It leaves a lot to the reader to pick up on it and not miss characterization or intent but it is great when successfully done.

I think part of your difficulty is that you need to be good at remembering off handed comments and connecting disjointed dialogue from different chapters to connect things when conclusions are left to be made by the reader instead of being expressly written down. Also, you need to remember that many characters straight up lie. You need to be discerning of when that is happening. I find it obvious enough but if you take what they are saying at face value, you'll get really mixed up. Also, in addition to lying, characters hide the truth from other characters. They won't tell the whole truth but as the reader you need to be able to interpret what actually happened.

In regards to your question. Nic is being serious, he's just saying it in a jokey manner cause he's having a mostly lighthearted conversation with his friends at lunch. I don't find it random at all. It was completely set up at the end of book one. it literally ends with Simole and Dizzy speaking together and reveals that they know what Nic did even though he didn't tell them. Nic lied and said he closed the door to the Other Place and trapped Roke there. However, Simole and Dizzy reveal that Nic did not. He took Roke back with him in his mind. He has her trapped in his mind. They don't trust him with being her warden and are collaborating to watch over Nic and Winnum Roke.

#+begin_quote
  “He was the door. He was always the door. He couldn't stop her, but he could stop her getting through the doorway. He trapped her,” said Simole. “Do you think she's really crazy? If she's inside him, it might end up making him go mad.”

  “He's too stubborn to let Winnum Roke change his mind. But he might lose control of the rest of his body. And then they'll know, and do something about it. They're too scared to trust him. That's why it's important you look after him.”

  Simole raised an eyebrow. “I thought you were the one who wanted the heroic jobs. He'd rather have you.”

  “He needs you. You can protect him.” Dizzy smiled bitterly. “Must be nice to be born with so much power.”
#+end_quote

They might work together and be "friends" but they each have their own agenda and desires. They also know each other's abilities/skills. As such, Dizzy and Simole do not trust that Nic has the ability to keep someone as powerful as Roke in check for long. Pretty reasonable and so they are going to be working together to do it instead because they believe in their own abilities more. You're saying that because they are friends they should trust each other and Nic is acting out of character but it seems like you are misunderstanding their characters instead. Nic knows that they know what he did and that this is how they will react, hence his comment.

You also say that they are just teasing and he is blowing it out of proportion but you seem to be misunderstanding their relationship. They are fairly friendly with each other and trust each other to be largely working for the same goal (As in they aren't evil). However, they aren't completely on the same side per se. Nic wants to do things as a primary actor and wants to keep Dizzy out of it to keep her safe (or at least he did in Book One). Dizzy wants the primary actor to be herself and refuses to be kept out of the loop. If they can take advantage and power away from the other in order to achieve this, they will. Dizzy repeatedly has straight up told him this though you might have taken this as just a joke?

#+begin_quote
  “Like I was saying,” said Dizzy firmly, “Simole I understand. You, on the other hand, are completely out of your depth. You don't deserve to be part of this, let alone leading the way.”

  “And you do?”

  “More than you.”
#+end_quote

She is totally serious. She has been jealous of Nic in the entire series because he gets to be directly involved in what is happening. She will take that role from him in a heartbeat even if she is friends with him and has feeling for him. Nic knows this but he is not willing to give it up.

#+begin_quote
  "I'm sorry if I ended up where you wanted to be. It was just dumb luck, I know, but it would be stupid not to make the best of it. That's all I'm trying to do now. Even if I'm doing it poorly, it's still my decision how to proceed, deserving or not.”

  “Yes,” said Dizzy. “I accept it, too. You're the winner here, there's no changing that.” She said it like he'd won a lottery prize of great value. That wasn't how it felt at all. “One qualified contestant, one wild card. But you're going to let me join. Whatever is going to happen from here on out, I want to be a part of it. I don't care if you think it's a good idea or not.”

  Her demand was met with silence. Nic wasn't sure how to explain his reluctance. At least not in a way that wouldn't cause her to turn violent.
#+end_quote

Both characters are helping one another but keeping an eye out for the other. Dizzy will take the chance to steal everything from Nic for herself and Nic will stop her from being involved if he can.

Also Simole is trying to remove Nic's agency along with Dizzy not because she wants to stop Nic's goals but because she wants to protect him. She thinks he is out of his depth and at risk of being turned insane by Roke or taken advantage of by the mages. So she will help remove his agency for his protection. The same way Nic wants to remove Dizzy's involvement to protect her. Just as Dizzy doesn't want Nic to do that, Nic doesn't want Simole to do that either.

Plus there are other reasons for the characters to be at odds with each other. IDK if this will ever come up again, but Nic was kinda (?) involved in killing Dizzy's dad

#+begin_quote
  “You can't keep him alive,” said Nic. “It isn't your choice.”

  “You think his heart will stop beating while I hold it in my hands?” asked the demon.

  “You have spent enough time among us,” said Nic. “Have you ever know spilled blood to be drawn back into an open vein?”

  The blood flowed out and the Minister fell to the floor.

  “Did you just overcome a demon's will?” said Simole.

  “Yes. It's their weakness, the direct contradiction. Don't worry, I can only do it here. Back home, you'll always be able to squash me like a bug.”

  Simole snorted. “Glad to hear it. Was it really necessary to let him die?”

  “There was no way to save him. This was better than the alternatives,” said Nic.

  “I'd like to see you convince the girl of that.”
#+end_quote

Obviously Nic didn't actually kill him. There was no saving him and Nic just wanted to let him die. But it would understandably upset Dizzy if she found out.

Also not revealed until later but when Nic let the door to the Other Place be closed, it cut off the Arcanum that the All-Father needed and this could have potentially put him at odds with Simole

#+begin_quote
  Simole's eyes narrowed. She knew Nic carried a passenger, the one he had just named. At least, that was what she believed. Nic judged her to be couching her next question in language that wouldn't give him away. Which meant she was still on his side, for now. Her relationship to the dragon was close. She had grown up with the giant lizard as a guardian, as a beloved pet. Even though she knew what it was underneath the scales and claws, her bond with the monster was no less intense. If you could love a fanged, flying leviathan of death, what difference would a little demonic heritage make?

  “You shut the door behind you?” she said.

  “The door is closed,” said Nic, as careful with his wording as she. He hadn't closed the door himself, Winnum Roke had done that. And she had done it from that side, locking herself in. Allowing him to leave with a parting gift lodged in his brain.

  “And you knew this would happen?”
#+end_quote

So yes they are friends but they are not above doing things they believe are right or self serving at the expense of one another to a degree.

********* I'm quite clear on dizzy in regards to nic, most likely because it's been very transparent so far. I'm sure it's part of why I find her so annoying. I'm not seeing anything of revelation in regards to Simole purely from references although I would question how she actually plans to remove nic from the equation. At most I've been led to believe she'll have to protect him and watch out for him. Perhaps she could start using force if she had to but I don't know if she's ever hinted at that. Or if he believes that.

In any case, despite any attempt to draw similarities to real life, this behavior actually seems less believable to me. His words start fine but become really spiteful for no apparent reason. They're so hyperbolic they become strange, especially since it's apparently just an assumption on his part. But hey whatever, I should probably come to accept that this novel won't have any flow or internal monologue help. The whole isolationist tactics in the beginning was still strange. Their little tete-a-tetes could only have served to make him extremely suspicious if not resentful (I assume maybe what the author was going for, but then why) - whatever their point it would only put his guard up. Especially after last book's events. So either intentional or incredibly stupid of both characters to do, especially if they have motives that deviate or go directly against Nic.
