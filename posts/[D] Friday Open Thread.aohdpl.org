Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

*** I mean, if there's new posters who bring new content and discussions to the sub then that's a good thing. It's sad when I sort by new and there's, like, 1 new post a day for several days in a row.

But yeah, obviously if popularity brings in a lot of people who aren't like-minded then that would ruin things... I don't think that will happen though. I feel like the subs that got popular and morphed either never really had a concrete sense of what they were about or the name of the sub itself was vague enough to be about too many t disparate things.

**** Not necessarily. There are a lot of subreddits that start out with a fairly clear sense of what's what that get overwhelmed by people who don't really care if what they're seeing matches the sub, only if it gets a reaction out of them. In most cases, it is simply that the modding can't or won't keep up with the growth, so posts increasingly off-topic become popular before they can be pruned, and the sub loses its focus because of it.

This place is a little more protected by the nature of its topic, which doesn't produce a lot of low-effort consumption memes, but if you got a bunch of people coming in who started posting and upvoting links to increasingly non-rational scifi/fantasy/etc stories, then it could happen.

** So.

I have a question that has been bothering me for a while, and which may or may not out me as a badly prepared alien infiltrator:

Do emotions/feelings have an associated sensation that goes beyond the physical symptoms and the urges/ changes in behavior they cause?

As an example: say I get angry enough at someone the outer bounds of my self control are tested. This means that my heart-rate spikes, my face distorts, my hands clench and I find myself imagining smashing his or her head against the nearest surface.

Is that all that anger is? Or is there some kind of sensation/qualia to it that I am missing?

I ask because both fiction and common usage implies that there is ('burning rage', 'cold anger', 'blazing love'), but if so, then I have never experienced it, or any other associated with anything but pain. (Ye Gods, that sounds ridiculously edgy.)

I'm confused even further by the fact that it is a common trope for someone to not realize that they're in love, which seems bizarre if there is actually a distinct sensation associated with it.

​

*** This might a "everyone assume everyone else's experience is the same as theirs" thing, but my answer will be radically different the other posts: yes, to an extent.

When I'm angry, there's often a qualia to it. Obviously expressions like "burning rage" or "it leaves a bad taste in my mouth" are kinesthetic; being angry doesn't /actually/ feel like tasting a really bad thing. But there's /something/ that lingers, some "taste" to my thoughts that is very perceptible beyond the physical symptoms and rash decision-making.

The most extreme cases feel like a cord going taut. When I'm so angry I fail at self-control, it feels like there's a "rope" between the anger-brain and my actions, with no slack between the two, such as any reaction by the anger-brain immediately results in me doing /something/ (obviously the kind of actions I've done in this state of mind aren't ones I'm especially proud of).

*** Burning [passion/anger] is just a form of metaphor. It doesn't /actually/ burn, but it certainly feels as if it's a consuming fire, turning everything it touches to ash. You can thank literature for the phrase becoming a cliche. The distinction between hot-vs-cold usually describes how dissociated you are at the moment. A cold rage is one that is in the background, influencing everything you do, but never coming so far to the forefront as to make you lose composure. Fiery rage is the opposite of that, flying off the handle at the slightest provocation.

Other times, the description relates /literally/ to a physiological reaction. "Butterflies in the stomach" is a cliche way of describing a fight-or-flight response. A pit in your stomach, similarly, might relate to tensing up your diaphragm and not giving yourself enough room to breathe, etc. If you get the chills, that could either mean that you're cold, that you're startled, or that you've experienced some form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson][Frission]]. (Speaking of frission, as one of the people who gets that feeling when listening to music a lot, I was actually pretty shocked to learn that not everyone experiences it.)

***** Yes. Emphasis on feels "as if" - the anger behaves /like/ a fire, in the sense that if someone goes near you, they may be caught up in the flames (that is to say, lashed out at. In the verbal sense, usually, because most of us don't carry whips.) And afterwards, once you are no longer angry (having "burned" through your emotional fuel) what's left is typically regret (ash).

**** Some descriptions are literal, some are metaphor. The interesting thing is, not everyone agrees on whether a given description is literal or not.

For example, as someone who's never experienced frission (and that's a new word to me!) from listening to music, I had always assumed that the phrase "That music gives me the chills!" was a metaphor meaning, more or less, "I have a strong emotional reaction to that music!".

Burning anger might not leave burns on the skin, but it can certainly leave the person who experiences it feeling a degree or two warmer than they otherwise would - so perhaps that's more literal for some people, too.

*** The distinction imho is similar to a sharp pain vs a dull pain. Sharp would be getting hurt, the pain you feel then and there. Dull pain is more like a headache.

​

Cold and hot anger are basically the same thing, and imho can be applied to most emotions if you are not pedantic with semantics. Sharp love would be like being very horny now. Dull love would be liking your SO. Sharp anger is screaming. Dull anger hate.. Sharp sadness the moment you learn somebody you liked died. Dull sadness mourning..

​

These of course are not 1 and 0s more like a scale and you can have anything in between. But that's imho the basics on how emotions vary, you can also see them as a lack of specific words for similar things being grouped together, sometimes these words exist and people can more easily distinguish between them when appropriate.

*** The easiest way I can communicate my thoughts is with an example, so bear with me for a bit.

Have you ever gone from getting as much sleep as you would like, to immediately getting significantly less?\\
This would for example happen if you're sleep schedule drifted doing a vacation, only to have to adjust to your usual routine the next day.\\
In such a situation, the consequence of being tired become a lot more noticeable, than in other circumstances.\\
Beyond the physical symptoms, you should be able to "feel", how hard it is to maintain your focus on any one thing, for a prolonged periods of time.\\
Except "feel" brings the wrong connotations, even if it isn't technical the wrong term. You only "feel" it, in the contrast to how you remember your thoughts normally going.

There's a general trend, to how your thoughts typically play out, and there's a distinct difference to how they play out, when you're experiencing some general emotion.\\
Sometimes these differences can be very difficult to notice, until some other emotion is felt.\\
My self, I have a hard time noticing when I'm sad and miserable, until I'm away from the circumstances causing those emotions, at which point it becomes crystal clear.

I would reckon other people just have different emotions, that they have troubles noticing, such as being in love.

So I would say yes, there is some "emergent" sensation to feeling an emotion, but knowing what kind of general emotions your feeling, " burning" or "cold" or some such, is probably beyond may people.

Though take what I say with some discretion.\\
I have been officially diagnosed as lacking almost all the empathy normal people have, and substituting sympathy can only correct for so much.

I feel you, sibling. I'm often baffled by how most people seem to be able to just pluck information about other humans' mental states out of seemingly thin air.

As for the only feeling things in contrast thing, I can certainly relate as well. I get semi-regular migraines, you know, the fun ones where you go blind, lose the ability to speak as well as all feeling in one half of the body and get a head-ache so bad that you vomit, with the occasional auditory hallucinations mixed in?

Anyway, sometimes they almost feel worth it, just for the feeling of overwhelming clarity I get when I wake up and find myself actually able to think again. The world seems crisp and clear and I feel as if I could understand /anything/.

On a side-note, my difficulty understanding emotions actually seems to have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia][name]].

#+end_quote

For me, the answer is 'yes'; but it's hard to explain further. I can explain why it's hard to explain by metaphor.

Imagine that I had come to you with this question:

#+begin_quote
  Do flavours/tastes have an associated sensation that goes beyond the physical texture of the food on my tongue and the amount of energy I feel after eating it?
#+end_quote

Now, I imagine you'd say that the answer is 'yes', but you can't tell me how honey and a lollipop are similar without referencing the qualia of taste.

In much the same way, I can't really accurately describe what various emotions feel like to me without speaking in either roundabout metaphor or directly referencing the qualia of emotions. But they do /have/ qualia, that much I can say.

I could try the roundabout metaphors if you want, but I'm not sure that they really help.

**** ...man, I wish I had thought of the taste analogy. Might have made this whole discussion a lot less awkward.

But yes, your answer is exactly what I was expecting when I made the original post. Imagine my surprise when instead all the replies said that 'No, the texture of the food on the tongue, along with the reactions of my body to it and the way it makes me want to eat more or less of it, is exactly what taste /is/.'

And now I am confused again. Either you are wrong, which would be strange since the question was whether you /experience/ qualia and not what those qualia /mean/, or the phrasing of my OP has led to a vigorous round of talking past each other, or the ability to experience emotions instead of just having them is a lot less common than expected, at least in our little corner of the web.

Maybe the issue deserves a clarified post/poll in next friday's thread.

And thank you for the reply, by the way.

Yeah, I have to agree. That is odd.

I do tend to find that, for me at least, the qualia of emotions are usually fairly muted, quiet things; nowhere near as obvious as (say) the qualia of taste. But they are noticeable when the emotion is strongly felt.

*** I suspect that the reason people don't realize that they are in love, is that love isn't a real sensation. After all, if you ask a large group of people what their sensations of love feel like, you will probably get a large variety of answers, everything from lust to avarice to empathy to jealousy to camaraderie to protection to cuteness overload. A person who has multiple lovers (sequentially or in parallel) can even feel completely different types of love for each one. So I suspect that love is just something people like to call a mix of sensations if it makes them want to be with someone or want the wellbeing of someone. At the very least, I have never experienced any one emotion that I could pinpoint as love.

In contrast, anger is a very real emotion of which there is only one type (as far as I know). I can pinpoint exactly which of my emotions is anger, though describing it is somewhat hard, like trying to explain what the color blue is to someone who has never seen blue. There can be plenty of different targets for anger, from individuals to society to the universe, but the sensation is always the same one (though the intensity may vary). The best description I can give for the feeling of anger is the feeling that something is unacceptable, that you will not allow it.

The only difference between 'burning rage' and 'cold anger' is that in burning rage you are letting your anger loose to destroy things around you (may be non-physical things, like ruining your relationships by saying hateful things), whereas in cold anger you are restraining yourself in some way (possibly because you are experiencing another emotion like 'willpower' at the same time that tells you not to do anything extreme). The amount of restraint you show determines how hot/cold your anger is, everything from supernova hot: *'I SHALL DESTROY EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING THEY HOLD DEAR FOR LETTING THIS SITUATION HAPPEN!'* to absolute zero: /'This situation does not exist. I do not acknowledge it and shall not react to it in any way (and you better make sure it doesn't exist when I come back)'/. But the base sensation of rage is the same either way, and the emotion can be just as intense regardless of the temperature.

***** You already said the bounds of your self-control are tested when you're angry. So wouldn't anger be "that which threatens to escape your self control" in that situation? That's a way to point a finger at it and say "this is anger". The symptoms you mentioned are all manifestations or side-effects of that impulse or of your attempt to suppress that impulse, but the impulse itself should be "anger".

Edit: I'm sure this isn't a /complete/ description of anger and it isn't meant to be, but it's at least something real that I think is not a symptom or side-effect.

******* Not quite. It was more that I was disqualifying things like "feeling hot" or "clenching fists" as being candidates for what "anger" is. I don't think you're going to get a set of necessary or sufficient conditions for "anger", so analyzing your own feelings and sensations when you're angry is going to be your best bet. If you trace things backwards from the "symptoms", you should eventually find the source.

Why are your clenching your fists? Because it's a way to (1) redirect your impulse for action into something harmless, and (2) it helps reinforce your willpower that's restraining you from taking impulsive action. Okay, so there's an impulse toward action without planning, often of a violent or destructive nature. Since it's an impulse that doesn't come from rational thought, then that impulse itself (along with it's associated suppression of rational thought) can be called "anger" or maybe the "qualia of anger" since I do think it's unique enough to be an identifier if it's not the emotion itself. I think that's a good enough answer for most purposes.

If you want to go one step deeper, then you could backtrace one more time and ask yourself "what causes that impulse?" and then call the answer to /that/ question "anger". It's just that when you get that far back, you're no longer really pointing at anything within your conscious awareness. At that point, you're probably pointing at instinctual social response patterns in your animal brain related to aggression, dominance, and fight-or-flight. Having those response patterns helped our ancestors survive, so we inherited them, but those are so low on the stack that it's not something you can see or feel. We only know they exist and where they come from because of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. It's the "source code" for anger, not anger itself as an emotion.

Is there anything /in between/ the "source code" for anger and the impulse for violence/destruction? I can't really think of anything. Therefore, I think the most fundamental /manifestation/ of anger is probably that impulse. Everything else is either a side-effect of your brain running the "anger" algorithm (blood rushing to the head, adrenaline spiking, etc.) or of trying to suppress that impulse with your rationality and willpower. The side-effects of running the "anger" algorithm are similar each time you run it, so there's a set of symptoms and sensations that often occur together when a person gets angry and we eventually learn to recognize this naturally occurring set of symptoms and side-effects as "how anger is expressed" both in ourselves and in others.

Any individual element is not sufficient for anger, and /just the sensations/ without the underlying impulse is also not sufficient. That would be closer to "pretending to be angry" if your body fully cooperated with you. Similarly, if you were to somehow experience the violent/destructive impulse of anger /without/ the associated physical symptoms, that would probably still be real anger, but it would /definitely/ feel strange. Imagine you were really sad and you were crying, like literally sobbing, but for some strange reason no tears came out and you didn't get choked up. That would feel weird, right? It doesn't mean you're not sad, but it would definitely be strange and you'd start to wonder.

Overall, I think you're worrying a bit too much. Emotions are universal within humanity, barring outliers, which means they're part of our brain's hard-wired circuitry rather than something learned. If there's no conscious mental aspect to a piece of hardwired circuitry, we call it a reflex. If it's a pure mental influence without any associated /feeling/, it's usually called a bias. It's the hard-coded algorithms that are a bundle of conscious mental influences, behavioral impulses, and physical symptoms that we call emotions.

The unique part of each emotion is probably a behavioral impulse, because the only reasons emotions would have manifested from the process of evolution is to create behavioral patterns that increase an organism's likelihood of survival, but the signature bundle of physical symptoms or sensations that comes with each emotion is relatively consistent, so they're often the easiest way for others to recognize emotions in a person.

You might say that anger lacks a "distinct qualia", literally the "feeling of anger", but I don't think that really makes sense. A "face" is made up of a bunch of elements, but when you look at a face, you judge it as a "face", not as a combination of elements. I think the "feeling of anger" is, similarly, the combination of all of the things that usually come along with it. Eventually you learn to recognize that as the "feeling of anger". There may be shades or variants or types that fall into certain patterns that are common enough to get names or descriptors, like "burning" or "cold" or "explosive", but those are, again, just patterns in the variation of how the anger algorithm is running at that time or if there are other things mixed in with it, like "also feeling fear" or "trying extra hard to suppress any reactions" or "anger mixed with regret". There doesn't need to be something more fundamental.

********* Remember that these categories are all fuzzy. Outside of Set Theory in mathematics, you'll almost never find sets that have absolute necessary and sufficient conditions to determine set membership or exclusion. Words and concepts, specifically, are totally fuzzy. The way the human brain handles sets is through the "prototype model". Meaning that a set (such as a group of things that can be considered examples or instances of a certain word or concept) have a "prototype" that represents the most typical member of that set. For example, the prototype of the word "bird" might be something like a sparrow or a crow or some other bird that you see quite often. Certain other things would also fall into the category of "bird" within your mind, but they may have more features that differ from the "prototype". So if you imagine a circle that has all the birds in it, the typical ones (typical bird shaped, small to medium sized, short legged, feathered, and capable of flight) would be in the middle. The "less typical" examples (meaning more different features) like giant condors who are huge and heavy would be a bit further from the middle. Then the REALLY atypical ones like Ostriches, Emus, Penguins, and Humming Birds would all be at the very edges because they have more (or more significant) differences from the "prototype" birds in the center. The thing is, a lot of birds also belong do different categories, or different "circles" with different "prototypes", and that's not a problem. For example, all birds are also in the "animals" circle, but they're toward the edge of the "animals" circle, because the center of the "animals" circle is probably mostly land-bound animals. There's also a lot of partial overlap too.

So just because something is near the edge of a certain circle, it doesn't mean it's not still a part of that circle. It just might also be in another circle and be even closer to the center for that circle. In the human brain, sets are not usually mutually exclusive. That's not to say that we can't categorize things with the concept of mutual exclusion: for example, no number is both odd and even. It's easy for us to do that. But if we're looking at how language and concepts developed organically, you'll typically find a lot of overlap and fuzzy definitions. And that's totally okay.

What I said in my last comment was just some musings and speculations backed up by a bit of knowledge. It's not definitive by any means. I think it's a pretty good perspective, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if you could find exceptions and edge cases. That's just how language works. The only time you have neat categories is when you're building a framework from the bottom up. Trying to shoehorn existing concepts into an artificial framework will always be difficult.

---

So, is pleasure an emotion? Or a sensation? Well, under the concept of my previous comment, the distinguishing factor for an emotion was "is associated with a behavioral impulse" or, at the bare minimum, "has an effect on how a person would /tend to act/". So strictly, pleasure would probably be a sensation. It's the warm fuzzy feeling you get when you hug a puppy or the euphoria after a workout or when taking drugs or at orgasm. These are clearly sensations. But when feeling pleasure, it's also well known that people will tend to act slightly differently: getting carried away when things are going well, being more generous than usual, being more outgoing or courageous, etc. You could make arguments either way. For example, it's not the "pleasure" that changes behavior, but the emotion of "happiness" that /results/ from pleasure that causes the behavioral change. In that case, it's pleasure is clearly a "sensation" not an emotion. But if you don't accept that argument, then it could be an "emotion".

What do I think? I think it's fuzzy. If I had to pick, I'd put it in the "sensation" category because I do think that "pleasure" is a distinct sensation. But it's so closely related with certain moods that if you were to argue strongly that it's also an emotion, I wouldn't bother quibbling about it. At the end of the day, it's never worth arguing about definitions. As long as you can convey what you /mean/ to another person, the words involved aren't important. For example, if two people disagree about whether pleasure is a sensation or an emotion, is that just a dispute about definitions? Or are they actually claiming that there are different neurological processes going on depending on which it is? Sometimes, if you're confused about whether something is X or is Y, it's a better idea to just not use the words X or Y at all and try to explain the phenomenon in different words. That can help you get to the root of what it actually is that you're uncertain about.

** Can someone tell me about the Fate series- specifically, when it gets good/interesting? I keep seeing fics and discussions related to it, and while volume of discussion isn't /always/ an indicator of quality, it's correlated enough that I would like to get into it. But so far the first one... oof. I'm reading an LP of the original Fate visual novel and I'm about 57 updates in and it's the most tedious shounen garbage ever.

The premise of the story is that there's some kind of dragonball-esque war for a wish granting mcguffin and all the mages engaged in this war get some kind of legendary hero from the past incarnated as a spirit to fight for them, and you win by getting rid of all the other spirits or killing their magi, and nobody starts off knowing the identities of the other competitors. This sounds /interesting/ and like the setup for some decent action and/or intrigue but so far the story literally has not done anything with it.

In reality the entire story has been another harem-fic with the wet blanket dumb-as-a-post main character gradually accumulating this gigantic stable of women who are all, for some reason, compelled to hang around him or live with him or mentor him or just really want to bone down. Of course he does not recognize any of this, being your typical misogynist Japanese protag player stand-in. He wants to fight but not hurt anyone, his justification is the usual poorly translated run-on stuff like "A man must fight to protect what he believes in so if that is my destiny I will be the Emiya Shirou who is the hero and choose to save everyone even if that becomes the proof of my existence." Everyone else constantly tells him he is a dumbass. I have no doubt that the story will prove him 100% right in the end, somehow.

He has no skill in magic, he isn't in any sense cunning, his only real ability seems to be that he is inexplicably charming to every woman in the story. He constantly orders them around, has no ability to discern or navigate his own emotions, orders them not to fight "For their own protection because they're women" despite easily being the weakest and most inept cast member himself. The VN goes out of its way to do the awkward bath scene, and the innapropriate-underage-child-in-bikin-bottoms thing, and just generally be as creepy and awful about women as it is possible to be. There is literally a scene where the main character learns a classmate was chased by some kind of molester at night and he says out loud "Good, she needs to learn to be more feminine and that's the only way to teach her." It's exactly the kind of shit that has seen me move away from most manga/anime.

Whew! Okay I didn't mean to rant for three paragraphs, but back to my original question. When does this pick up and get interesting? When does this MC get throttled with his own wet blanket, and replaced by the cool and good lady mage who has moved in with him? Why does every VN assume that I want to read everything from the viewpoint of the most ignorant, least competent character in the series?

*** Disclaimer: I am a huge Fate fanboy and nerd.

OK, first of all - the original VN has tremendous problems, as noted. The VN is in three major different story arcs, and the first and shortest arc is the worst of the three; the second and third are much better, but it's literally 10 hours or more of reading before you get to /start/ the second arc. Even then, the second and third arcs are longer than the first (more like 20 hours of reading each) - it's not that they don't have the same number of bad bits like the first arc does, it's more that they are supplemented by a much larger portion of awesome bits as well. It's not quite as bad as, say, Muv-Luv in terms of 'gigantic pile of garbage in front of the bits people might want to read' but it's awful close. In arc 2, Unlimited Blade Works, we get a Shirou who actually develops some confidence and ability of his own, and also a lot more focus on Rin as a character; in Arc 3 we get a bunch of real horror and despair and so forth and also a focus on Sakura. However, both are still told from Shirou's perspective. If you decide to bail on the VN before it gets there - I /understand/ and sympathize, and don't blame you at all.

You could just start from Fate / Zero the anime. There is no way to read the Fate franchise where one work won't spoil another to some extent because of the way prequels and sequels are interwoven, and Fate / Zero has reasonable animated fight scenes and characters and so forth and is generally considered decent. Then maybe hit the Unlimited Blade Works anime and the Heaven's Feel movie series (currently being released). You can avoid a lot of the low points of the story if you do this.

--------------

On the topic of Nasu-created stuff, go watch Kara no Kyoukai if you haven't already. It's got some gorgeously animated scenes and also the soundtrack, by Yuki Kajiura, is fucking fantastic. It's only loosely tied to Fate properties but I wholly recommend it to everyone.

*** Most of Fate isn't very good. It /is/ very shounen and has tons of fanservice fluff, and Shirou does have a lot of women falling over him while being clueless it's happening.

But for his naive "white knight save everyone in the world" view, it's very explicitly an insane viewpoint even within the setting, unlike Naruto. One of his character facets is that he's /not sane/ - he will do anything to save anyone he comes across, even if it damns everyone else, and is manically focused on being a "Hero of Justice" and what that means to him. It's explored a lot in Unlimited Blade Works. His viewpoint does cause him severe problems.

I'd recommend watching Fate/Zero instead. It has a more interesting story and you'd probably enjoy Kiritsugu as a main character a lot more, since he grapples with ruthless effective altruism and grey morality throughout it. Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is the "interesting" VN, but I think requires you to read Fate/Stay Night to understand what's going on (and is famous for being mindscrew-y).

See for instance Naruto/My Hero Academia/Dragonball/etc etc etc

The problem is that any victory from this morality feels so /un-earned./ If you really are committed to maximizing positive outcomes for /everyone/ you'd damn well better work at it, but the heroes in these stories are always kind of bumbling fuck-ups and everything works out for them because they are literally the /first people in their worlds/ to go "Hey but what if I was just genuinely nice to everyone though?"

*** Personally, I think it is better to watch/read Fate/Zero before any other Fate material, because most other Fate/X material looks like utterly generic high school battle romcom on the surface. Fate/Zero gives it all perspective as the continued tragedy of Emiya Kiritsugu, an MC who is definitely not generic.

Spoilers for Kiritsugu's beginning: When Kiritsugu was a young boy, his crush Shirley got infected with a magical zombie virus and begged him to kill her before she becomes a zombie. Kiritsugu, having a generic shonen protagonist mindset at this point in his life, refuses to kill the one he loves and runs away instead. When Kiritsugu returns, pretty much everyone has been infected and the entire town has been set on fire to try and limit the spread of the zombie virus. All the places he loved? Gone. All his friends? Dead. Almost all the people he knew? Dead. All because he refused to kill someone he loved. That gave him a lifelong trauma that allowed him to kill and sacrifice literally anyone with no hesitation, whether he loves them or whether they are innocent. He spent the next several years as a utilitarian murder machine: weighing lives on a scale and killing the minority side everywhere he went, until the events of Fate/Zero began.

In some sense, Kiritsugu is a white knight that wants to save people. Except his method of doing so is by murdering everyone on the minority side of the utilitarian scales. By the end of Fate/Zero he has murdered almost everyone he ever loved for the greater good, and lost the rest. Now imagine how messed up Shirou from Fate/Stay Night actually is, as an amnesiac kid that Kiritsugu adopted and raised.

Watching Fate/Stay Night from the perspective of "How much more tragedy did Kiritsugu cause?" is far more interesting than from the perspective of "When will this dense MC finally wise up?"

Magical girls reveal themselves and start getting thrown into the meat grinder and off we go. It's got a lot of themes of child soldiers, utopian world building, war and trauma, but it has this kind of detached tone that never quite lets it get grounded enough to hit home for me.

If this was written as a normal person would the previous phrase would have been "people here speak without certainty".

*** The main problem I see is that the vast majority of humanity believes (instinctively or otherwise) that confidence is convincing. The idea that "if someone is confident enough that they will bet everything on something, it must be true" is pretty pervasive, to the point where people literally treat confidence as an important criteria to look for when hiring new employees or choosing a romantic partner.

And unfortunately, this thinking is horribly wrong. For two reasons:

1. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect][Dunning-Kruger effect]]: people who do not know a lot tend to also not know that there is a lot they don't know, which makes them more confident because a greater fraction of the world seems to be things they know about. In contrast, people who know a lot tend to also know that there is a lot more that they don't know, meaning the fraction of things about the world that they know appears much smaller, making them less confident. (And rightfully so, since human history is pretty much the history of us being wrong about reality, over and over and over.)
2. It is usually easier to train to be confident than it is to train to be competent enough to genuinely deserve that level of confidence. And seeing as both methods reward people socially by the same amount, it is obvious which path is typically chosen. As a result there's plenty of people everywhere who appear super confident while not actually knowing anything.

So if we want to be more convincing than people who know less, we first have to convince people to stop treating confidence as something that is convincing. Which is a catch-22 kind of situation since we aren't confident enough to convince people that confidence isn't convincing. And hiring confident people to convince people that confidence isn't convincing doesn't seem likely to work since the message would contradict its delivery.

If you preach extremism outwardly, and internally discuss how it's only to counteract other groups' even worse extremism in the opposite direction... don't be surprised when you convert people to extremism who then join your group and take every word seriously.

If you value promoting rationality less than you care about winning the audience, present your case in whichever way you believe have the highest probability of convincing your audience.

On a tangent, I would really like it if rational people would talk in probability rather than just writing it. In the latest bayesian conspiracy, someone said something like: if we do X then something undesirable happens but if we do Y then we achieve the desirable outcome, rather than saying both X and Y have some probability of achieving the desirable outcome but my best guess is that Y have 40% higher chance of succeeding so that is the desired course of action.

*** It kind of depends. If you have one opponent, randomly selected, and you know nothing about them, and you can only execute a predetermined strategy, then I'd say that rationality's principles for accuracy should be ignored. The reason for this is that the average person has no rationality training and thus no respect for its principles. Instead, they respect things that sound or feel convincing.

​

"Climate change will result in 98% more tornados in Kentucky because of the interaction of unusually hot air with the jet stream." Is this true? Maybe. I pulled it out of my ass by jamming together a bunch of complicated-sounding words to make a story. Now, /you/ can recognize that it violates the conjunction fallacy, and you might even know enough about climate change to call me out -- but if you don't have that training then all you can go by is how plausible the story sounds. Telling a story with a built-in uncertainty is setting it up for failure.

​

If it's a randomly drawn group etc, try to dominate the argument. Speak loudly, interrupt people, etc, depending on the norms for the setting. The objective here is to starve your opponent of the chance to defend yourself. This works even better if you outnumber them (you can take turns tearing them down and think of avenues for attack faster than they can defend). The goal here isn't to convince them. That's probably not going to happen, because they'll look weak if they back down in front of everyone else. But, you can convince everyone else who hasn't decided yet. Don't waste time trying to be accurate or "rational", just focus on defeating your opponent. The best defense is a good offense.

​

If it's just one person, then you have the greatest chance at convincing them. I would suggest avoiding outright argument here and instead work on figuring them out and manipulating them into changing over to your side very, very slowly. Be their friend, not their enemy, and slowly drive a wedge between them and their view. Or, if you luck out and they're reasonable (and you actually have reason on your side) then you can do what you suggested and just be accurate.

But fewer people can be accurate because that requires more work and knowledge.

** The reddit anime community has been in quite a tizzy lately over the recent admin crackdown on lolis(sexualized young anime girls. The exact definition is debated and that's part of the problem, but they're definitely always U18). On the more reasonable end of the crackdown is banning users for posting drawn pre-pubescent girls committing hardcore sexual acts, which while most in the community seem mildly upset about, big emphasis on the 'mild' and they're accepting it. On the less reasonable end and what the community is very upset about, is banning users over drawn teenage girls in somewhat sexual poses/outifts. E.g This [[https://np.reddit.com/r/Holofan4life/comments/ao8ujj/he_fuckin_dead_lmao/?st=jrvyvxbm&sh=996aed26][pic of a anime girl in a bikini]] apparently got an active member/mod of [[/r/animemes]] banned and there's a lot of discussion/memes about it.

The general consensus in [[/r/animemes]] is that if characters are fictional, any sort of drawings should be allowed, and the fact that the drawing was more or less SFW just makes things even more outrageous. A lot of users are talking about making their own Voat of some sort or just moving to Voat, but there are concerns about "when you take a principled stand against witch hunts, you get 3 principled activists and 10 000 000 witches" and they don't want the new community to be filled with Nazis like Voat. Notably they, from what I've seen, don't seem to be concerned with the idea the new community would be full of people posting child hentai, just that the new community would be full of Nazis and homophobes.

​

In terms of actually adressing your post though: I find that cencorship always have some negative utility but in many cases this utility is outweighted by the consequences of banning some content. On the concept of drawn child sexual content, the question is whether allowing it will increase or decrease child rape rates. I would suspect that it would increase it and if so I definitely think it it's cencorship is warranted.

But see, this is my point. We're talking about whether or not it's bad. We could maybe do a study on it to find out who's right! Can't do that if it's censored. /But wait/, you say, /does that mean when it's found to have a negative effect on society, you'll be OK with banning it?/ My answer would depend on why it's bad, I suppose.

To address your first questions: Censorship is censorship. Certainly state censorship is worse (and I'd be bring up constitutional rights if I knew you were in the U.S. like me) but yeah, it's still censorship if a site says they don't want something on their website.

It isn't really feasible to do a controlled study on this. The closest thing to a study that you can do is to ban it now and do a time series analysis to see how much the act of banning it changed the rate compared to the predicted rate change. So I guess my vote goes in favour of enforcing it unless a rationalist with with a anthropological background tells me otherwise.

I'm half Danish, half American though culturally Danish. I wonder if the reason that Americans places such astronomical utility value on freedom of speech is the part of it as a cultural identity. In Germany there is a state cencorship on nazism as a political party, and of the people I know I honestly only think that the Americans would say that's a bad thing.

But it does have wider implications for Reddit as a whole if the admins are banning significant users who don't seem to have actually done anything wrong as false positives in their crusade to appeal to advertisers. This sets precedents for future action against subs like [[/r/the_donald]] and how much the admins are going to micromanage Reddit as opposed to letting mods do their own thing. It shows the Reddit cares less about their userbase and more about advertisers. Maybe those don't actually affect you and you use Reddit very narrowly, but it does affect a lot of people.

** You know, I've always hated how the TV show LOST ended - both because the ending itself sucked but also because it didn't serve as an ending to the series. But I only just realized I hated it so much because the show ended up being anti-rational.

I dislike magical realism I enough as it is, because it's basically where magic things just happen randomly and inconsistently with no central structure or principles. Often just to drive the plot forward.

And LOST is so atrocious to be because it doesn't present itself that way. When you watch the show there are tons of cues for this, from the breadcrumbing clues to keep people hooked to the attention the camera pays to the mysteries. And the payoff is nonsensical. And nothing gets resolved. At least in something like One Hundred Years of Solitude (my go-to example for magical realism), the author doesn't pretend there's a 'why' behind all the random magic.

I'm curious to know if there's any fans of rational lit who liked LOST.

It's missing the part where the story shines its focus onto it for no payoff.

I hated the ending originally, but eventually I realized the writers tried their hardest to give the /characters/ a decent ending at the cost of the plot, which was a lost cause anyway.

Half the remaining questions were mystery box shit that just were never going to be properly answered, and I agree with you the ending is basically anti-rational, but it's still a great show if you don't treat S6 as the conclusion to a mystery show but to a drama show. Horrible by [[/r/rational]] standards? Of course.

I will say though, I think you're doing the show a disservice in claiming "things just happen randomly", the show got increasingly worse at it, but small mysteries /did/ get resolved. We did find out what the hatch was, why there were polar bears...

**** Some things got resolved, yes. I certainly can't argue that. But I would say that a lot of the things that were resolved were short-term mysteries that were added just so that they /could/ be resolved (and to ramp up the mystery & cliffhangers rather than serving an actual purpose [this is part of the randomness I'm talking about]). Virtually none of the overarching mysteries are answered satisfactorily -- in fact, when they're addressed at all, the answers either raise more questions or only address the *what* and not the *how* or the *why*. Which is /excruciatingly/ unsatisfying when the *what* is "magic" and the *how* this magic works (what are its rules? - yeah, remember all those mentions of 'rules'?) is never explained and the *why* is likewise never explained beyond a vague Manichean struggle.

My main beef with the show is that I wasn't watching it for the drama or the characters. Maybe that's my fault? That I put too much expectations on the show? But no, as I was saying before, I think it's the show's fault. It's the show that put so much time and focus on the mysteries, I only followed along. It's really unfair to build up things that much and then hand-wave them away.

But honestly, I don't even think I can give the show a pass on the characters. The newcomers to the island are somewhat well characterized, I'll give you (when they're acting consistently, which is not all the time) but everyone else? The fact that we don't know why the heck anything is happening is horrible for characterization. Characters need to have background and motivation to be believable (let alone relatable).

I swung back and forth several times on liking certain characters, as did you, I imagine. But in my view this is not good characterization. The only reason this happens is because why they're doing what they're doing is clouded in mystery and my imagination is filling in the blanks to make their actions fit the circumstances. It falls really flat when it turns out my imagination was wrong because there was no reason behind their actions or their reasons aren't logical or rational. (Which, incidentally is largely why I think a lot of things go unexplained.)

To your first point, the writers may have tried their hardest to give a good ending, but they utterly failed as storytellers because they wrote themselves into that corner to begin with. To give a really bad analogy, I'm not going to give a drunk driver credit for swerving at the last second to try and avoid hitting me when he was driving drunk in the first place.

Sorry for the rant. I'm trying to stay out of specifics so I don't get bogged down but if you're confused I can give examples. Though now I reread what you wrote I will address your two examples:

- The polar bears. We didn't ever find out why there were polar bears there beyond "Dharma brought them". Which is a non-answer. Obviously either they were brought there or they didn't exist in the first place... you can't answer "why were there polar on a tropical island?" with "because I brought them there."
- The hatch. The answer is that it's there so that people can live there to save the world. This is an example of what I'm talking about where the show addresses the *what* but not the *why* or the *how*. Why is this happening? Why does it need to be underground in a bunker? Why do people need to live down there? Why can't it be largely automated? Why was all this necessary if there was a fail safe? Why are there blast doors and quarantine signs? Why didn't Jacob fix things? Why didn't The Man in Black ruin things? How did this electromagnetic pocket come to be? How does it work? How does the bunker work to fix things? How does the failsafe work? How does the electromagnetism relate to all the other mysterious things on the island? How the heck do the numbers relate to all this? ... ... My point is, the whole mystery behind the hatch -- beyond the fact that it's initially found on what was otherwise thought to be on a deserted island -- is that it's really weird for there to be a random underground bunker in the middle of a forest. The provided explanation does not make sense beyond the superficial (like, faced with a similar situation as the Dharma guys did, there's no way rational people would have come up with a similar solution). Which basically means the hatch was there to be mysterious. Yay?

No hidden magical underworld, no secret orgs, just a dude(tte) that gets some powers that grow bit by bit and has to rationalize and use his (rather magical/reality breaking and offensive) powers... however they can be used.

I know the erogamer is very much similar to this, with its own funny little twist. I haven't finished erogamer (like 4 arcs in), but is erogamer pretty much this? Or are there others around similar in this regard?

The reason for magical underworlds and secret organizations in these kinds of stories is because the modern world becomes unthreatening pretty quickly with fantasy power creep (also rule of cool). If you don't want to use those tropes, then depending on how high-profile the MC's actions are, you'll need to go pretty in-depth with how the modern world reacts to the MC's actions and make sure that it's a realistic and significant threat to MC's success, wellbeing, and anonymity.

Things that would make me avoid or drop such a story: MC is exposed and is constantly hunted by someone/everyone, it turns out there's actually a bunch of people like MC who pop out whenever it's convenient for the narrative, MC just steamrolls everything and there's no challenge, or MC's biggest problem is the military might of those opposing him rather than their effectiveness as national/global intelligence organizations.

What would be the MC's goal? If I can get behind that part of it and then see the MC do research and make plans, raise money, attempt strategic operations, fail (but not catastrophically), revise those plans, take advantage of normal non-super things that have new significance or importance now that MC's a super (and probably rich), try again in a different way, etc., I think it could be interesting.

I guess not if you don't plan on having the MC engage in any "actiony" conflict. But if the MC is not working toward their goals as they grow in power by tackling larger and larger goals that lead up to the eventual goal, then all you're really left with is reflection, analysis, and internal conflict along with overkill conflict resolution in trivial day-to-day situations.

I'm sure it's possible to write a good story like that, but it will be highly dependent on execution, since you won't get much mileage or BotD from the concept alone. Even if it's not "action", you absolutely need conflict between the MC and certain aspects of society or else you won't be able to do a thorough "examination" of them. I mean, I guess having the MC just experience things without taking any action while thinking about what to do about those things /later/ could be interesting, but progressive conflict is important to storytelling, even if it's not an "actiony" type of conflict.

Not OP, but are you referring to stuff like Jumper (where everyone hates the MC just cuz) or stuff like Worm (where lots of people hate the MC because she did something to piss them off)?

***** Haven't read Jumper so I don't know, but mostly I was referring to the "ah, he's got a special power/object/etc. that nobody else has! let's hunt him down to [learn it's secrets / force him to work for us / dissect him / steal it from him / etc.]". Really common trope in amateur fiction. Gives the author an easy way to have there be action and conflict and to drive the plot, but removes almost all agency from the MC and forces them into a reactive state.

******* I feel that you could do it believably. Conflict should arrive from a clash of interests such as, the MC knows people who are unjustly in prison and wants to get them out/ the MC wants to redistribute wealth and the top 1% wealthiest notices the threat eventually/ the MC wants to change the system by getting majority in congress.

******** Those are all choices though, which is what [[/u/Cuz_Im_TFK]] was complaining about. The MC acquires power and chooses to carry out the prison break, which has the consequence of making them a wanted criminal. In the cliche, it's the other way around. They get power and that immediately makes them a criminal, even if the only thing the enemy knows is that the MC has some weird power.

​

Certainly there are cases where a competent villain wouldn't want to take the risk, but in most instances I think it would be better to at least figure out who the MC is and what their goals are. If all they want is for you to let their buddy go, then that's a pretty cheap way to buy loyalty, or at least get the MC to let their guard down so you can slip some poison in their beer.

********* Right, I agree and would actually go further and claim that most fiction I have read recently is just the MC being forced into action by circumstances with squat agency.

I was bringing suggestions to ways it could be done differently since someone in this thread was considering writing a story around that. I was referring to government run prisons rather than villain run, and for many modern governments there are incentives to not succumb to pressure from single powerful people, and for said people not to openly say that they'll break into a prison to rescue a friend.

*** Honestly, this is why The Gamer was so intriguing to me originally! I got much less interested once the whole secret history and secret underworld things were revealed.

I think you totally could have an OP MC, too - maybe he becomes a superhero like Batman or Superman where (originally) there aren't other superheroes or villains with superpowers.

*** Smoke alarms are large and distinctive enough that they'd probably be found relatively quickly, unless they have an uncommonly messy house.

​

Ideally you want to install a noise generators in something they already own so that they won't be able to tell what's out of place.

Bonus points if the noise generators have proximity sensors so they mute themselves if somone is nearby (say in the same room) so in aggregate the effect should be that any time you go searching for one you only hear the one(s) that you aren't nearby enough to find.

*** Calm down Satan.

Five years ago we had to deal with this for about a week. Could not figure out which of the installed smoke alarms was causing it. Eventually realized that it was a battery powered one buried under a bunch of junk we'd forgotten about.

On the plus side we found out that the brand we had installed had been recalled in the late 90s and got some new ones for free, which is definitely in the better half of ways to find out your smoke alarms are defective.

** Wanna watch Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?

No?

Well, you /should/ want to, [[https://ia601605.us.archive.org/9/items/ChittyBang/Chitty.Chitty.Bang.Bang.1968.mp4][so here it is anyway]].

(The first 6 minutes are pretty skippable, it begins with almost a literal full minute of a black screen with engine-revving noises bouncing back and forth between the left and right audio channels, followed by like 5 minutes of opening credits played over a car race).

EDIT:

Honestly, if you never saw the movie as a child then you might want to skip the first 64 minutes of the movie entirely. There's really two movies here that are both roughly an hour and 15 minutes long. From 1:04:23 to about 2:17:13 is the fun stuff, and then the first 64 minutes and the last 8 minutes are a frame story that's all mush and sop and feels bloated and padded out. If you watched the movie as a kid, indulge the movie its padding for nostalgia's sake. If you've never seen it before, go ahead and skip the first 64 minutes, because it'd be a shame to miss out on the fun stuff just because they over extended the frame story.

**** Well, it's a kid's movie from like fifty years ago. The songs were written by the Sherman Brothers, the same writing team who did the songs for a lot of Disney movies (including Mary Poppins). But these songs are a bit flatter and less fun than they'd be in a Disney movie. And a lot of the musical numbers could've probably been half as long as they are and nothing would've been lost. The movie doesn't move at a particularly snappy pace, just like a lot of movies from long ago.

Individual shots in the '30s averaged about 12 seconds, and individual shots now average about 3.5 seconds ([[http://people.psych.cornell.edu/%7Ejec7/pubs/cutting&candanProj15.pdf][source]]), and it's been close to a linear decline over that period of time (ie people didn't just all of a sudden become ADHD, it's been a gradual change). I looked it up, and CCBB has an average shot length of 6.43 seconds, almost twice the current average. It makes the movie feel even more drawn out than it already is at two and a half hours long.

Honestly, it probably won't be of much interest to anyone who didn't watch it when they were younger. Like, I find it /fascinating/ because I haven't seen it in over 25 years, and the last time I saw it I was so young that a lot of the meaning just went right over my head (I think I used to watch it a lot when I was three and four years old, and presumably I went the entire intervening period without watching it again).

Just from an anthropological perspective, I think it's interesting to consume content you normally wouldn't, y'know, just looking at things the humans have made. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

EDIT: I mean, the movie is still /quite/ delightful, if you allow yourself to be carried along by that sort of thing. I wouldn't've recommended it if it weren't worth watching, I just thought it should be noted that the slow pace might be off-putting, especially in the beginning, if you don't have childhood memories of it stuffed away somewhere up in your brainhole.

EDIT: I went and found Roger Ebert's review of the movie from when it was released 50 years ago. He had this to say, and I'd agree with him wholeheartedly:

#+begin_quote
  "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" contains about the best two-hour children's movie you could hope for, with a marvelous magical auto and lots of adventure and a nutty old grandpa and a mean Baron and some funny dances and a couple of moments when you've just GOT to cover your face and peek between your fingers, it's so scary.

  But the trouble is, these two hours of fun are surrounded by about another 45 minutes of soppy love songs, corny ballads and a lot of mushy stuff.

****** Ebert was wrong. It isn't two hour's worth of fun surrounded by 45 minutes worth of mush and sop, it's about an hour and thirteen minutes' worth of fun (from 1:04:23 to 2:17:13) surrounded by about an hour and twelve minutes worth of mush and sop.

You could easily skip the first 64 minutes and the last 10 minutes without really missing out on much of anything because the rest of it is an extended frame story; the fun stuff is meant to be understood as happening in the kids' imaginations while their dad tells them a story, and it'd be a shame to miss out on the fun stuff just because they over extended the surrounding frame story.

There /are/ some fun scenes peppered into that first hour, but there's just so much Nothing between them that if you aren't in the mood to indulge the movie its padding then it's not worth getting bored and abandoning the movie before it ever gets to the fun part.

** Trying to remember the name of a manga but can't for the life of me remember the name. Hopefully this is the right place.

So a bunch of people get kidnapped and gifted with abilities, before being pitted against each other in fights. Everyone had a different ability, but the main characters ability was 'whatever ability your opponent believes you have.'

They took advantage of this by making it seem as though they have the same ability as the big bad, the ability turn their arm into a cannon.

It was recommended in one of the monthly recommendation threads a while back but I've trawled through a bunch and can't find it.

Any help would be appreciated.
