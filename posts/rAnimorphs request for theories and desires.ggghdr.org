Hi, all. Next update coming soon; it's more than halfway done and while I'd hoped to have it out this past week, I'd be very surprised to fail to have it out this week.

I'm also hoping to keep the steam up for another string of 4-8 chapters, meaning a greater than 50% chance of only one more hiatus before the fic wraps up (I estimate we have fewer than 15 chapters remaining).

That makes this sort of my last chance to elicit things from the audience in a way that can have major impact on the resolution (as opposed to minor tweaks here and there to make things more Awesome).

I'd be very interested to hear things in the following three overlapping categories:

- What you /expect/ to be addressed/resolved; what your sense of the major open threads and unsolved mysteries are. Things you'd be disappointed about if the fic wrapped up without ever touching on again.
- What you /want/ to see happen; what interactions you're hoping for; what dreams you have for various scenes or whatever. Fan service, remaining references, things in the superset of which "ships" are a subset (but not just ships pls).
- How you /currently think/ things are going to play out, given what you've seen so far. Predictions, wild theories, etc.

I have pretty solid plans, but I've had pretty solid plans and had them shifted pretty majorly before, and y'all have been a great source of clever ideas throughout. So here's to one last collaborative effort.

Note that if people do indeed feel like accommodating this request, this thread is gonna end up containing ALL SORTS OF SPOILERS for the chapters published so far, so new readers beware?

*EDIT: SO FAR THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M HOPING FOR; PLEASE KEEP IT COMING.*


** - What's the deal with Rachel?

  - Why don't the Chee recognize her after the teleport, and why can they give her the weapons later?
  - Theory: Erek managed to erase/corrupt the memory of her doing violence in the few milliseconds between passes of the Censor cycle
  - Theory: The Chee are capable of breaking their prime directive, just not capable of /planning/ to break it. They can do things like ram a Howler ship or drop a memory of violence, as long as the refresh cycle doesn't pass between having the idea and acting on it.
  - She's /not supposed to be there/, which means at least some long term game moves were made without taking her into account. When did the players finally notice her and start adapting?

    - Wild theory: The majority of the game was meant to play out in the kids' hometown just like in canon, but Rachel blew their cover, and neither Player was willing to spend the in-game resources it would take to undo their long-term plans enough to change that.

  - What caused the morph seizure disorder? Is it related to her weirdness, or coincidence?

    - Theory: A pointer in the hypercomputer got nudged, and every time she demorphs it tried to copy over both the version of her mind that's currently running, and the nth saved copy from her previous demorphs, where n the number of times she's demorphed since rezzing. She doesn't get memories from every demorph because not every morph-mind copy is backed up, just the ones from events that are significant to the game.

- What's the deal with Jake?

  - How did he know what Tom was thinking well enough to write out /scissors scissors rock paper rock rock rock paper/ in advance, and win? I looked up competitive rock-paper-scissors records and they're impressive, but not that impressive. Is his little black box more than it seems?
  - How did Elfangor know that Jake was thinking the word “kidnapper”?

- Time travel?

- Theory: The Visser /should/ destroy the earth if the probability of success drops below some higher threshold than 1/7, but the Ellimist made sure Andalites evolved with seven fingers specifically to get Visser to anchor on subtly wrong probabilities. The way he arrogantly dismissed the prophecy (“/IT DID NOT DO MUCH FOR CASSIE WITHERS, I SEE./“) was also the Ellimist's hand at work.

#+begin_quote
  What you expect to be addressed/resolved; what your sense of the major open threads and unsolved mysteries are. Things you'd be disappointed about if the fic wrapped up without ever touching on again.
#+end_quote

- What exactly, did having Rachel along change? What would the story have been like without her?
- Why did Cassie have to die? What would the story have been like if she had survived?
- What are the win conditions for the Ellimist and Crayak? What are their respective plans for Earth and the rest of the galaxy if they win?

As for how I'd like the story to end:

- I'd like to see them figure out the win conditions and exploit them to kick /both/ god-like entities out.
- I'd like them to solve the parasite/symbiote problem by having the link between Yeerk and host to be fully bidirectional, rather than controlled by the Yeerk.
- The Hork-Bajir get to return home, and demand better treatment from their creators.
- Theory: the problems Rachel is having are due to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloneDegeneration][clone degeneration]], that is, from imperfections accumulated in the copying process. You can't just keep jumping between dying bodies forever as a path to immortality.

...That's all I've got for the moment.

**** In a more traditional story, I'd agree, but the addition of Rachel is a core deviation from... something (and is implied to be /the/ central deviation by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/15/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 2]]). There was a prophecy about that /four/ humans would be the ones to meet Elfangor, not /five/, and I think it's a question that needs to be answered: What did the prophecy state, and how is it different from the reality with Rachel included? Note that [[/u/daytodave][u/daytodave]] also included something similar as one of their questions.

Similarly, the death of Cassie was a decision apparently reached in collaboration between the Ellimist and Crayak, despite being one of the four main "chosen" agents of humanity. One of them was shown simulating the results of that meeting, over, and over and over. in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/22/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 4]], before, apparently, /both/ players made the decision that Cassie was expendable. The reason they reached that decision is pertinent to the story.

If these were the results of the protagonists' actions, then sure, exploring them would be omake, rather than part of the story; instead, they're concrete manifestations of the decisions being made by the forces influencing the outcome of the story; insight into /why/ they made those choices should be part of the resolution of the story.

** I have a few things from earlier in the story that I'm not sure about. I think some of this is just me misunderstanding the text but here we go.

From Chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  /You don't ever get in the car with the kidnapper, man. No matter how bad it is, it's only going to get worse once you give them home field advantage./

  <I am no kidnapper, Jake Berenson.>
#+end_quote

Did Elfangor just cold read him there, or somehow actually read his thoughts, or is this not the first time he's done this. Just kind of weird that he pulled the exact word kidnapper out.

--------------

What is the deal with Jake's black box? Like Jake and the other characters explicilty refer to it as magic because it's so inexplicably right all the time. I get why it's not all that high on their priority list of trying to figure out but look at this bit:

#+begin_quote
  One day, I even wrote down scissors scissors rock paper rock rock rock paper in advance, put it in my back pocket, and proceeded to win all eight tosses. Tom locked me in a closet, Dad made him do all the yardwork, and we switched to flipping coins after that.

  It's not that my brother is stupid, or unimaginative, or especially predictable. It's just that growing up with him forced me to pay attention---to perfect a kind of awareness that Tom never had any incentive to develop. It wasn't a conscious thing. It's not like I was thinking hmmm, he threw rock last time and lost, so he'd stick with rock to surprise me, except he knows I'd predict that, so he's actually going to switch to paper! No, I just looked at him, and some part of my brain spat out paper or scissors or rock, and if I listened to it, I won, nine times out of ten.
#+end_quote

This is bullshit right? It's bullshit that Jake has lived with his entire life so he may not even realize it but something is up with this. The text even goes out of it's way to say "nah this isn't cold reading or prediction, it's straight up magic".

--------------

How is it determined what injuries carry over and which don't? (Honestly this is only here because in Chapter 5 Tobias says to put that one on the list, and it seemed like a good idea).

--------------

Probably not important, but why is Esplin signing to the central command hub instead of just using telepathy at the end of Chapter. Opsec from the hosts?

--------------

What actually happened to the Chapmans? The Animorphs think that the Yeerks did it, Esplin thinks it's suicide, and Garrett agrees with that in his recap interlude. That one just seems a bit off to me, I could possibly see the Chapmans fighting for control at a key moment and dying but with their daughter in the car?

--------------

Who is the One Who is Remembered? Rachel makes a mental note to ask about it later but hey priorities.

(Actually looking at the other replies that's probably the Chee that tripped the censor so the others could escape the Howlers).

And speaking of the Chee and the female, what's the deal with that? Maybe if they dehumanize her then they can give her weapons... but why would that only work on her? The brief hypersight in Chapter 10?

*** More stuff:

I'm really interested in seeing what the player in Interlude 13's plan is. They seem incredibly confident +Literally incredible etc.+ In an eternal game of N+1 gambits patting yourself on the back for tricking the other guy seems like a death flag. Like, the expected ending of this game is an unironic version of that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCg_ES4ApY&t=22s][one "no I tricked you" bit from Rick and Morty]] and suddenly a quick win falls into your lap and your response is "It sure is convenient he fell for my trap, gottem!"

You know, maybe playing a game like this for a long time actually makes you /less/ paranoid? One of them already talked about how you can't keep checking something forever or else you're wasting resources. At some point you do just have to let it ride and if the other guy is playing you he's playing you.

--------------

God okay the time travel stuff. Argh.

We're told in the recap interlude that Elfangor spent several years as a human. Did they pull that from Elfangor's memories? I've been trying to find where they originally found that out and can't (I think they are told that when they find out about the previous timeline but the recap happens before that). Actually maybe the Animorphs actually didn't know that since it's a recap including things Garrett wasn't there for, but I don't think the reader knew that either at that point? Elfangor has at least one hidden memory, but from the description it sounded like a dayish thing and not a several-yearsish thing.

Why was the Time Lattice still there when Visser One got there? In canon when you used it, it was taken with you. Does it just stay there while it sends you to a new universe? Is it simulating a new universe inside of it (complete with another Time Lattice that simulates another universe)? Did Elfangor even use it at all? Visser One and Elfangor never compared notes, his extreme competence might not have been because of future knowledge.

--------------

I kind of want to meet Cirran, if only for some kind of "Yeah, sorry, this whole thing was my bad" moment. Even if it technically wasn't I guess, since the part of Cirran that started all of this in the first place is Esplin now? Anyway I'm kind of curious about how Cirran feels about all of this.

*** There was a theory in a comment a couple chapters ago that TK accepted as (head?)canon. With most species the Yeerk can silence the host's mental voice by plugging the right neurons, but since Andalites are telepathic, and since thought-speak sounds like the recipient's own inner voice, the Yeerk half of an Andalite/Yeerk hybird can't perfectly silo its own thoughts from the host's, and over time they blend together.

**** That makes sense. I'm still registering that this came across to me as an important question. IIRC, they bring up with Ellimist/Crayak prior to the Arne mission and he gets mysterious about it. My takeaway was that Crayak created the chaotic Yeerks, the Ellimist the unifying, single-voicing Andalites, both to be the best possible mortal representatives of themselves - and their synergy gives us a clue into what the Ellimist and Crayak could gain by merging.

***** I think it's subtler than that: Crayak and the Ellimist have calculated that actual conflict ends in a Mad Queen race/race-to-the-bottom, so they designed the game such that it rewards cooperation most of the time:

#+begin_quote
  “If you were seeking to destroy all life on Earth, you might first create an industrial society of intelligent beings capable of doing the job thoroughly, rather than risking a quicker, more haphazard solution,” the creature said. “Such a plan might look eerily similar to, say, a plan for human ascension---right up until the critical moment. You wouldn't ordinarily expect two plans with opposite outcomes to strongly resemble one another, but here there are strong forces incentivizing cooperation and convergence.”
#+end_quote

I think the Yeerks and Andalites were created by the players together, and the actual pieces that "belong" to each player are the two Yeerk/Andalite hybrids in the universe: Crayak has the Visser, the Ellimist has Helium.

****** Ah right, instrumental convergence. Instrumental goals which help you achieve many different terminal goals will be shared by agents with every terminal goal which can be achieved through them. What this means here is that Ellimist and Crayak's goals are at least comprehensible to the other. If that were not the case, not only would they have few to no cases of instrumental overlap, but they wouldn't allow each other to implement the cases of instrumental overlap, in case they understood the others' terminal goals poorly and wound up helping the other agent far more than they helped themselves. Basically, we know that Ellimist and Crayak know what the other wants because they're both willing to implement things which advance both of their goals.

******* Keep in mind that the Players' ultimate goals aren't necessarily the same as the win conditions of the game. The whole point of playing the game instead of fighting a war is to preserve as much of the universe as possible, so they probably designed the win conditions specifically to maximize instrumental convergence the vast majority of the time.

** I'm just here to thank you for such an amazing story. Made me so happy and excited for several days as I've been catching up and reading everything you wrote up to this point. Absolutely brilliant, can't say enough good things.

Not sure if I have any constructive feedback. I'd love to know more about the gods and the lava creatures and the spooky eye and how the hypercomputer works, but I'm assuming that's coming. I guess it would be great to learn more about the other worlds that were only mentioned in passing so far(where past and current battles took place).

Some scenes have shown characters in Z-space experiencing time and thoughts in a more rapid or complicated way. So, what's happened to these people who've been in Zspace for years?

IIRC in one of the Megamorphs books Cassie was more in tune with 'E/C fuckery' than the rest of the Animorphs. Also, in r!Animorphs death has been shown to be a 'temporary setback if you're willing to deal with some downsides' ex Rachel, V3, losing all your morphs etc, so I'm not 100% convinced that Cassie's out of the picture...

- Why is it here? What purpose does it add to the gods' game? Have a time machine in the middle of your "competitive spore" game feels like trying to make Monopoly better by adding Godzilla to it. Like, I can kind of see why someone would do that, but it seems pretty extraneous.

- How does it work? It sounds like it's neither straightforward time travel, nor reality warping like in canon. Why did it jump the Yeerks and the Andalites back in time, but not Earth?

- How many times has it been used? How many parallel universes are there?

*** My guess is that the existence of the Time Matrix is a case of instrumental convergence. Both Ellimist and Crayak saw use for a time machine in carrying out their plans, and so they allowed its creation. For beings like them, the existence of a thing does not mean it will be used. Unless they agree to let it be used, they can always just Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies any group which is about to use it, meaning the only groups capable of using it are ones which serve both of their goals. But neither of them ever get to involve a time machine in their plans if none exist, and so they agreed to create one and argue about who used it later.

** (Sorry about my English, not a native speaker)

At first, the Animorphs had to learn how to /not lose/ the war. Dealing with stuff like leadership, responsibility, decision making, trust, doing the right thing even when it's hard, avoiding mistakes due to bias, trauma, powerful emotions, enemy deception, etc.

And it made me want to learn to do the same.

Now, they are learning how to /win/ the war, and how to effectively wield stuff like ruthlessness, betrayal, trust (again), larger picture, PR, MAD, etc.

And it kiiinda makes me want to learn to do the same, but also it seemed like they pay a really heavy price for it. They all look pretty exhausted and mentally damaged, and while it is not /because/ of the rationality techniques they learned per se... I don't know.

Anyway, what I hope for is that they learn how to win the peace. How to /solve/ the war, not just win it. And also how to be at peace with themselves? I realize that I'm being really vague here, but it echoes a bunch of real world questions I'm dealing with, so I would definitely like to learn stuff about it.

** Hoping for:

- More background on the Leerans. Why have we never seen the Leeran's thoughts or memories during hypersight sequences? I'm guessing it's because the bodies are frozen, and their brains only do their /processing/ in Z-space, memory storage is still frozen with their physical bodies? What was Leeran life/culture like before the Yeerks? How does society work when concepts like "secret" and "trust" and even "communication" just don't exist? (Hey wait, was their whole planet made to exist so V3 should eventually have a way to precommit to keeping promises?)

- More alien minds. They're one of my favorite things about this story.

** I'm hoping the following from canon be addressed / nodded to / etc:

- atlantis. like they need to appear somehow or just be mentioned as being killed

- at the end it got really dark with them turning disabled kids, i'd love a nod to that even though they do kinda have the army on their side and are doing kinda the same thing with the self-clones so maybe i answered my own question

- cassie was "grounded in reality" or something and didn't accept weird realities. i know she's dead (OR IS SHE) but i found that really interesting in the books

- the buffalo/ant morphing humans. like seriously wtf.

other stuff:

- look i'm going to be honest i'm kinda lost sometimes when i read the story because i forget what happened before or i just don't quite follow what happened and miss implications. i'd love a couple of authors errata stuff that include a really dumbed-down summary of the entire story (like, a couple of sentences per chapter, with all spoilers/background) so that i can appreciate it better (maybe you can find a Loyal Fan to do it for you)

- i'd love a kind of 'bestiary' where you explain all your detailed headcanon about the different species and stuff like that, any background info for them, inspirations, etc

- him going back to the ocean to marry that dolphin OTP

- that whole supercomputer that detects morphs, i feel like it's been dropped, so it should be undropped maybe?

- what i really like is far-flung epilogues, Luminosity was great for that. I'd love a whole bunch of light-hearted romps about Jake and revived!Cassie's children learning to morph and how criminals are using the morphing powers or andalite thoughtspeak etc to do things. Like, whatever the hell random topics of how life will "go back to normal" when the war is over. Ideally wholesome but if it's a sad ending then cripplingly sad stuff about Tobias mining salt while the visser whips him or something

- the Rachel thing is super intruging to me

- i agree with whoever said that the animorphs should double cross C/E, but we should also learn their motivations, so they s hould learn their motivations in order to doubel cross C/E

- also i want them to team up with V3 to do it and they find out they're Not So Different or some shit

- also i want alloran to have the last laugh

#+begin_quote
  What you /expect/ to be addressed/resolved
#+end_quote

What I expect (but if you want to take it in another direction, that's cool too):

Why is Rachel broken?

The backups of minds of people who stayed past the time limit or died in morph should be either deleted or merged with their current instances.

The gods should either turn completely friendly, or ascend beyond the human universe, deascend into limited (but possibly powerful) bodies, or die.

The construct data should be either destroyed, or used to bring the "dead" back (Elfangor) (this could be just hinted at - like saying in the last chapter that they should start research to bring them back).

#+begin_quote
  What you /want/ to see happen
#+end_quote

The Ellimist wins and becomes a benevolent god.

The main characters realizing (I'm more or less certain this is true, not completely, but still) that being restored from a morph-backup isn't a destruction of your consciousness. (Probably won't explicitly happen, but possibly a gradual acceptance (which might already be happening), etc.)

Alloran should be split away from Esplin (it's disturbing that this occurs to me /after/ the metaphysics part).

The Yeerks should converge to the same morality humans have and finding Controlling as abhorrent as other races.

David to come back along with the (hopefully) resurrectees, but getting a moral core, and having an epic "What have I done?" moment.

#+begin_quote
  How you /currently think/ things are going to play out
#+end_quote

Esplin dies with Alloran. Either the E/C die, or Crayak dies. The hypercomputer will be used to smoothen the negative consequences of the war. The morphing power either ceases to be available, or is radically transformed.

*** I too think Esplin dies with Alloran, esp with the new bodies that don't have a Yeerk/host division anymore.

Technically Esplin already died with Alloran in the recent chapter ;)

  What you want to see happen; what interactions you're hoping for; what dreams you have for various scenes or whatever. Fan service, remaining references, things in the superset of which "ships" are a subset (but not just ships pls).
#+end_quote

Please please please patch in the scene from the TV show where Jake tries to intimidate Visser Three by slowly eating delicious escargot in front of him.

EDIT: I'll settle for a throwaway line, obviously, but it would also be great if they actually sent clones to, like, a tense sitdown meeting at some point, and a Marco just...pulls out a bag of gummy worms, to be petty.

** Rachel accidentally creates a Z space virus that removes /something/ in yeerk biology which inhibits two way linking between the host and yeerk. This in turn destroys the ability to safely morph and a critical piece of the gods' computer so E/C aren't able to interfere through Z Space. Of course this means you have eldrich abominations immediately wanting to destroy Rachel/Animorphs/Earth/Everything for ruining their game. That's ok because humanity has a little bit of time to become a race of Collaborators and/or team up with some other races to ascend and Kill The Gods. Ram the blade ship!

Omake: Rachel fucks up, attempts to target something within Helium, the computer misunderstands and targets something within helium ie: all electrons in the universe and everything stops

** I'm hoping - since Cassie is out - that Rachel will be spared this time round. The world's gone to shit anyway of course (too real) but still, she was always my fave of the team back in the day in all her complexity and incongruity.

On that note I guess a small part of me is hoping we see a bit more Cassie at some point too, if only in a short form. And (although it may have been addressed, I haven't read back far for a while) I'm curious if we'll ever see anything of Loren who was imo one of the few characters who was poorly served in the original series.

Otherwise, I'm mainly just enjoying being on the ride! I'd rather not go wild on the predictions as that might spoil it for myself!

** I wonder how V3 will reach the end of the story. There's a lot of possibilities right now - I wouldn't push the option of him winning entirely off the table, although I'd be pretty darn disappointed if he gets his way as it stands. If he loses, I'd like him to have the chance to understand how/why he loses, even if happens to be mere seconds before he dies.

What I'd like to see but doubt would see happen? V3 dies by being reabsorbed back into Cirran.

** Thought speech targeting. How did V3 privately find Tobias without knowing who he was specifically? Can you use this to do computations somehow? Say you gather 26 people each with a name starting with a unique letter (or something similar) somewhere + a thoughtspeaker who puts various constraints on the target.

Does anything stop you from acquiring yourself from yourself?

I still do not really understand what interlude 1 was about or rather how it happened. Does this universally happen as time is running out? Is something kind of keeping track of time for you, then?
