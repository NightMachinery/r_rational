As I have not read beyond the first chapters (I can not read the author's style), I come here to borrow the knowledge of those who have. What sorts of feats/spells is possible with low/medium-level Arcane magic?

Just curious, why haven't you read further, and for what purpose are you asking?

I haven't read the early volumes for a long time, but I seem to recall that Arcane magic allows for things like:

- Silencing wards (preventing any sound from extending more than a few feet away)
- Enchantments that boost certain parameters (luck, protection, constitution)
- Tracking (like a homing beacon)
- Shielding, especially against energy sources (like wands)
- Working like electricity to power weapons/arrays/vehicles/etc.
- Teleportation (higher level, I think)
- (Slightly) disruptive of Divine magic, opposed to Fae magic, and disrupted by Infernal magic (see Circles of Interaction, volume 3, chapter 3)
- Strong direct magic attacks, like fireballs and magic missiles. Tellwyrn is an Arcane archmage, so what she does is usually (but not always) through Arcane magic.

The things I enjoyed in the story did not make up for what I did not like, and I'm not masochist enough to suffer reading something for a paid off that I do not think will come.

I recently found a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/arachnophobia-worm-the-gods-are-bastards-crossover.746014/][crossover between TGAB and Worm]] (which is being written in a style I like much more than the D. D. Wedd's), and I want to get an idea of what Arcane magic is capable of, to have an idea of what to expect from the next chapters.\\
Thank you for your help!

Could you elaborate? I have my own particular criticisms of TGAB, but I'm always curious what turned other people off. Most of the criticisms I've read about the writing style are smoothed out over the first few volumes - and those about implied authorial bias are strongly reversed and countered as the series goes on - but I do admit to having a soft touch when it comes to the series since I've been invested for years.

Oh, spiffy! I'd probably need to reread Worm to get into this... but I'm not up for doing so. Tonally, TGAB is pretty much the opposite of Worm. I've specifically recommended it as a palate cleanser for those who burned out by the grimdark (or grimdark-lite) nature of Worm. In TGAB, plot armor is literally part of the overall narrative for the main characters.

Early on, I think Arcane is mostly shields, charms, and powering tools (enchantment). Besides high-level users like high elves, blue dragons, and Archane Tellwyrn herself... they are masters of the craft and rain down destruction as they please, unlike low-level users like Gabe. Unlike all the other schools of magic, Arcane isn't tied to a specific deity. It seems to make it a bit more nebulous than the rest; its limits are less defined, its usage is more widespread, and it doesn't require outside assistance or piety to work. For example, Divine requires the patronage of a god; Fae requires relationships or pacts with spirits; and Infernal will likely result in the swift death of the practitioner unless they work with a specific god or are taught by red dragons. Arcane is a lot more analytical - if you know the words and the patterns and the intent, you can invoke it - no gods or pacts or risk required. It's like operating the machinery of the world to some extent (though all magic is, really).

You really don't have to for the linked story, as it's a TGAB fanfic first and foremost. The Worm elements introduced so far are strictly flavouring: (Worm spoilers) Taylor has one arm; Taylor killed Scion; Taylor /used to/ have an insect-themed power. That's the full extent. Honestly, if you treated it as a TGAB fanfic with a "mysterious OC protagonist" you'd lose nothing at all.

***** Also, IIRC, arcane is the only school of magic that is self powered. People store mana, essentially, into their auras and use that to cast spells. The stored up mana can run out. For the other three schools, the power is directly borrowed from its source directly, and the only limit is the user's tolerance. Divine channels energy from the Gods, but the user can risk burning themselves out if they draw too much power. Infernal energy is basically free and extremely easy to access, but it will corrupt any user if they're not careful in its usage. And Fae is entirely at the whims of one's contracted familiars and allied spirits, and you need gifts, relationships, and favors in order to do stuff.

*** In addition to that, we also see

- Other types of wards (against teleporting, against scrying, etc.)
- Scrying
- Storing things within your aura (pocket dimension)
- Elementalism (so fireballs, like you said, but also ice, wind, etc.)
- Polymorph (though this is high-level)

** Much like how divine magic is opposite of infernal, arcane magic is the opposite of fae in many ways. This means that it's very much based on maths, careful application of theory, and stuff like that. Given the time-period of the world in the story, the most impressive thing a low level wizard can do is some slight enchantments that take a lot of preparation, and maybe some more versatility with wands.

The time period of the story is basically late-western inspired. Wands are essentially guns, and unless you're very powerful/skilled/have access to specific knowledge you're probably just better off using a wand or a staff (heavy rifle equivalent). The age of heroes is over, a low/medium-level arcane mage is working in a factory to make enchantments.

The two arcane mages in the story are Gabriel who just uses wands, and Fross who is a Fae creature who converted her considerable power into arcane magic. Other than that the only relevant ones are medium/high-level ones who operate as battlemages in elite forces, portal operators, and professors...and the incredible archmages of course.

** Arcane magic is what puts the world into a 40's era level of technology. It's orderly, follows consistent rules, and lends itself to making repeatable +circuits+ runes. Runes are also used for the more magical magic effects like forcefield shields, temperature regulation, silence, and so on.

It also tends to fail catastrophically near fae magic, depowered near "holy" magic, and overcharged near infernal magic.
