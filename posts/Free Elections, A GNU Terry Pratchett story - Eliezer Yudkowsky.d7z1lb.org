** I always thought Moist would end up running Ankh-Morpork after Vetrinari died. Moist is in control of communications, banking, and has strong links to transportation. Vimes is too Manichean to rule effectively, as Vetrinari alludes to several times. Carrot can't take the job. I asked my wife, and she thought somehow Nobby would find his way into the position, which seems like a strong Pratchettian solution.

*** I could definitely see this being the shape of the full novel, if one were to exist. Vimes takes over as Patrician and holds it just long enough to let the people choose his replacement. Nobby runs alongside a few other humorous choices like the Troll crime lord (cannot remember that name for the life of me right now). There's send-ups of debates, empty campaign promises, even the very concept of voting. All sorts of hijinx ensue. In the end, Moist Von Lipwig, who didn't even run, is elected in a landslide. The next book covers Ankh-Morpork's first president assembling a cabinet and getting down to the business of actually running the city.

Too many people put marks next to his portrait at the top of the ballot, so he accidentally gets elected.

Havelock Vetinari was fighting for his life.

Vetinari was aware of how rusty he'd become, like a knife that had been sheathed with blood still on its blade. The searing pain in his shoulder bore testament to the wound he'd already taken. Even so, Vetinari was among the finest students ever to survive the Assassins' collegium. The instant he heard too much silence from behind and to his left, he whirled and stabbed his attacker through the chest with his favorite stiletto, that had appeared as though from nowhere in his hand.

OW, his attacker said politely, as though to indicate a respectful acknowledgement of the fight.

Behind where Vetinari now stood, a corpse lay upon the floor, hand clutched to left chest. The part of Vetinari that had never left the Assassins' Guild noted that despite the pained look on the victim's face, the man probably had not suffered long; and estimated that it would be some hours before the body was discovered, having appeared to die of natural causes.

The knife Vetinari had driven into the skeleton's chest was his favorite stiletto from childhood, abandoned one mad day in the alleys during a desperate fight against a street mime.

Vetinari held himself to be a complex person, but being slow to comprehend ill news was not one of his cherished complications.

"I do apologize..." the ex-Patrician of Ankh-Morpork began, and then trailed off.

The pain in his chest was gone.

He was feeling a different pain now. It was the agony of juggling heavy axes for years on end, until keeping them in the air became your whole life, and then watching all those sharp blades heading for the soft and vulnerable floor.

That tended to happen when the juggler died.

Havelock Vetinari realized that he had made a mistake.

"I should like to leave a note," Havelock said. "Even a short one will do."

YOU ARE LATE. THERE IS A REASON IT IS CALLED THAT. SOME THINGS ARE MUCH EASIER TO DO FIVE MINUTES BEFORE MEETING ME, COMPARED TO AFTER.

There was a gritty feeling beneath Havelock's shoes. The world around him was fading into a night sky.

He'd somehow managed to neglect this possibility, amid all his cares. There'd been a time, many years ago, when to designate another as the successor of Lord Vetinari would have been a death sentence - either for the successor, or for Havelock himself. But those unsteady times had passed, padding away so softly and quietly that Havelock had failed to take notice of their departure. And so he hadn't...

"A dream," Havelock said. "One whisper, one haunting. Please. If I don't, they'll all think - that I meant to -"

THERE IS A TRUTH I OFTEN THINK OF, AND RARELY SPEAK. MOST SOULS WOULD TAKE LESS WELL THAN YOU TO HEARING IT. THERE WERE MANY GRAINS OF SAND IN YOUR HOURGLASS. EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS USED AS YOU WILLED.

"That was stupid of me, I much agree," Havelock said, his politician's mind plotting out possible courses of conversation and seeking paths to success. He was unaccustomed to playing the part of supplicant, these last years, but you never forgot how to ride a person. "Should others suffer for my stupidity? It's not for my own sake that I ask this one thing of you."

IT WILL ALL WORK OUT. The skull was regarding him with implacable compassion.

"I'm certain it will," Havelock said with a tinge of acerbity, "but how will it work out? Disastrously, perhaps?"

THAT IS THEIR AFFAIR NOW, NOT YOURS. I SUGGEST YOU CONSIDER WHAT FOLLOWS FOR YOURSELF.

All his office faded. He stood now upon a plain of endless sand, his soul dressed in death as it had been in life. There was only a more endless night sky around him.

Long ago, Havelock had believed himself a selfish sort. One day he'd seized the chance presented by Mad Lord Snapcase, to take the city of Ankh-Morpork and be applauded for it. Every day after he'd spent on defending his new possession, the wounded city all his own. Defending it from fire, from flood, from envious aristocrats. Defending it, most of all, from well-intentioned people with terrible ideas. In time Havelock had begun to think of himself as the only reasonable person amid the madling crowd. And what was reasonable, contrasted against the follies he spent his time fighting? Why, reasonableness was that which promoted the thriving of his new city. So Lord Vetinari had become a horrifyingly reasonable person, given time for the habit to sink in, reasonable to the exclusion of almost all else. That was the sad, the awful, the reasonable story of Lord Vetinari; and having acknowledged it long ago, Havelock saw little left to contemplate about his life.

"I've killed some, and saved others," Havelock said. "What is done in a case like that?"

I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SETTLED FAIRLY. ONE MAN, ONE VOTE.

In the distance across the desert, faint shapes regarded him with accusation or grudging acceptance.

"That hardly seems fair," Havelock said. A tinge of apprehension rose in him. "I tried to do what was best for them, not earn their approval."

YOU MISUNDERSTAND. The skull turned, the dark robes began walking away from him across the sand. YOU ARE THE MAN. YOU HAVE THE VOTE.

His Grace, Duke Sir Commander Samuel Vimes, stomped over to his bedroom door in a way that should have been impossible for a man wearing soft socks and walking on plush carpet. He yanked the door open and growled, "Do you know what hour of the morning this is, Captain?"

Carrot was supposed to say it wasn't morning, and then Vimes could have been acerbic at him.

What Carrot said instead was, "The Patrician's dead, sir."

"Is he now," growled Sam Vimes. His brain didn't even need to wake up for this one. "Let me guess, nobody's managed to find his body."

"He was found dead in his office, sir."

Vimes paused. "Horrifically missing his head, I suppose -"

"No, sir. It's him, sir."

"And mysteriously, Drumknott seems to be missing -"

"He's watching over the body and crying, sir." Captain Carrot's face seemed bloodless even in the reddish glow of the candle he had brought with him, the lonely fire reflecting from his cheeks as if paled by them. "Looks like it was a heart attack, sir. Very few people know right now, but I don't think it can stay that way indefinitely, sir."

Vimes's mouth reached for the next automatic sentence, found none, and elbowed his brain to supply an actual thought.

"Hold on," Vimes said slowly. "You're not saying he's dead, are you?"

One hellish ride through a night-dark and winter-wet city later -

Sam, with Sybil only a step behind him, looked into the room where Drumknott was sitting beside a body. The ex-Patrician's secretary was no longer crying, but the evidence of it was visible on his face.

The part of Vimes that had never left the Night Watch noted that despite the pained look on the victim's face, the man probably had not suffered long; and that the color of his face was consistent with death having occurred several hours earlier due to natural causes.

Without conscious thought, Vimes removed his metal-rimmed helmet, and held it to his breastplate.

Time passed without words.

"What happens now?" said Samuel Vimes. He looked at his wife Sybil Ramkin, then at where Rufus Drumknott sat by the body, and finally at Carrot Ironfoundersson. "What happens now?"

Drumknott wiped once with his fine sleeve at tears that had already dried on his face. The man looked up, and gave a meaningful look to Carrot.

Carrot hesitated, and then, with a more innocent expression upon his face than usual, looked to Sybil.

The interplay was not lost on Vimes, but he didn't know the meaning of it.

"It's going to go mad out there like a shaken bucket of bees," Vimes said to fill the silence. He could see it coming, now that it was one day too late. He'd somehow managed to neglect this possibility amid all his cares. "Every power-hungry bastard in the city squabbling over the one chance in their lifetime to eat a square meal, and the meal is us. We'll have to keep order until it -" Ends? Vimes couldn't imagine how it could end. There was no rule written down for saying the business was over. The city of Ankh-Morpork had been a simpler place the last time power had changed hands.

Vimes wanted to curse. But it was too early to speak ill of the dead. And also Vimes was, in truth, feeling saddened. Vetinari evidently had not expected this any more than Vimes had. Lord Vetinari would have done better by the city, if he'd seen this coming; Vimes had known him well enough to know that. "I wish," Vimes said without rancor, "he'd remembered to say who the next Lord should be."

There was another silent exchange of glances.

"Dear," said Sybil, "how do you suppose Havelock should have designated his heir?"

Vimes gave her a quick puzzled glance, as expressive as a hand-written letter in their private code. "Pointed to someone?"

"Suppose he'd pointed to Drumknott, sir," said Captain Carrot, ignoring the look the secretary gave him. "And then suppose someone didn't like that."

Vimes could see it. "Would've painted a giant target on someone's back, and a day wouldn't pass before it was full of so many crossbow bolts there wasn't room for another. Couldn't Vetinari have found a more subtle way, though? He was a subtle - man." Subtle bastard, Vimes had almost said, but he wouldn't be saying that any more. Vetinari had served the city as much as Vimes had, and fallen in the line of duty.

"Yes, sir," Carrot said. "He definitely could have been more subtle."

"Lord Vetinari would have needed to ensure his successor had the loyalty of the city's armed forces," said Drumknott, giving Carrot a withering glare. "Strong loyalty, wholehearted loyalty. There are other factions in this city that could muster arms. They would need to know they faced more than halfhearted opposition."

"It would also help if he happened to marry into the nobility," said Sybil.

"Yes," said Drumknott. "It would be better if the old nobles did not see him as entirely foreign to their own class. Granting him a further title would not go amiss, of course."

"It might be a title that outranked all the other nobles of the city," said Sybil. "If Havelock wasn't trying to be that subtle."

"Which," Carrot said, "would paint a target on our man's back, all right. He'd have to pick, if you'll pardon the expression, sir, one hell of a tough bastard. The kind whose price in the Assassin's Guild is a placard underneath his face saying Don't Bother."

"When did you get into -" Drumknott began, but then stopped himself.

Vimes considered himself slow on the uptake, but not that slow. "You're saying there's some secret heir running around?" He gave Carrot a quick glance, but the conspiracy in the air didn't seem to be focusing on him.

"No, sir," said Carrot. "I don't think it was much of a secret."

He glanced at Sybil, who had a sad, guilty look on her face. "You also know?" he said. "Why wouldn't Vetinari tell me?"

Drumknott rose from where he'd been sitting next to Vetinari's body. "I expect you would have objected vigorously to his choice of heir. On grounds of unsuitability to the position, no doubt." Drumknott swallowed. "I must bring his Lordship's current papers before his Lordship. There are many urgent matters awaiting him."

"Hang on half a candle," said Vimes. "Who are we talking about?"

"I'm sorry, Lord Vimes. You have my condolences." Drumknott bowed, and politely walked out of the room faster than most criminals did while being chased down an alleyway.

When Vimes turned to look at Sybil and Carrot, Carrot had disappeared.

It was a while before Vimes said anything. He believed himself to be, in many ways, a stupid man, but over time he'd learned not to be too stubborn about that belief in front of Sybil.

"We have a son," Vimes said, the first words he'd spoken since the others left the room. "What kind of life would he lead?"

"Much the life that the son of Duke Vimes was leading already," Sybil said. "The kind where he never worries about where he'll find his next meal, and has some other worries to pay for it. Many another lad would trade places with him in a heartbeat. That's what my mother told me about being the daughter of Duchess Ramkin."

"I don't think Young Sam is getting a fair deal," said Vimes. There were many more words in Vimes's head, full of anger and justice; but when he imagined saying them to Sybil, he already knew what she'd say back.

"If it were not Sam Vimes," Sybil said, "it would be someone else's boy instead. Mother told me that too. I think Sam Vimes will deal with it better than some children would."

"Do we ask him what he wants, at all?" said Samuel Vimes.

"Of course we can ask him what he wants, dear," said Sybil.

"Does his answer change anything?" said Samuel Vimes.

"If we're willing to watch Ankh-Morpork burn," said Sybil Ramkin. "Some would call it a chance to thin out the riffraff, if it wasn't their own street in flames."

Vimes turned and looked at the corpse of Havelock Vetinari. He wondered that he still couldn't find it in himself to curse the man, even after having been damned to hell by him.

There was a wetness on Vimes's cheeks. He hadn't been expecting that. Like some comically hapless pair of lovers in a theatre's story, he and Vetinari had worked side-by-side for years, and never acknowledged out loud to one another that they'd become, for much of that time, friends.

"I know it's not a good idea to put you in charge of the city," Sybil said. "We all know. I've no doubt Havelock knew too. It looks like he didn't have any better ideas, Sam. I expect he found himself able to come up with cleverer ideas, but not better ones."

"There's not knowing any nicer places to drink, and then there's going and having a drink of the river water," said Vimes. "There must be some better way to select the next Patrician. I'd ask Archchancellor Ridcully about a spell for it, if not for the fact that I know not to."

"I'm sure that Havelock put thought into it himself," Sybil said. "If anyone knew his own mortality, he did. It seems this was the best he could do. I'm sorry. We all are. But we're in the middle of an emergency, so stop being silly and go do your job."

** Does anyone know of any good Discworld fanfiction, or perhaps unrelated work done in a similar style (and by that I mean the dry, British humor + woah deep nerdy social commentary + interesting worldbuilding common to it and something like HG2G? I'd say the humor also characterizes something like Bill Bryson's travel works?)?

Good people can end up in some kind of hell if they think they deserve it, too. (There's a joke in one of the books to the effect that people can only think they deserve hell if they know about hell in the first place, so missionaries should be shot on sight.)

The character that I recall who best fits the description of "unscrupulous monster" (of the characters whose ultimate fates were described), got reincarnated as a potato.

If that doesn't seem so bad, consider that it was the kind of potato that gets fried up for chips, which, combined with the way he died in the first place...

I don't think anyone would argue that character got off any easier than he deserved.

***** He doesn't technically have to contemplate anything. He's just used to hearing the phrase "one man, one vote" in political terms, rather than how it applies to the rather specific situation he finds himself in.

It tends to be more like 'what they know they deserve' rather than 'what they say they want', I think.

In the case you describe, I'd expect for them some sort of ironic hell where their own judgment and misjudgement of themselves ends up condemning them.

***** One of the things that also comes up is that on the Disc, the dead have almost no capacity for self-deception. The pleasant illusions of your inner life are revealed and you see what you actually think, not what you told yourself you thought.

This doesn't deal with people who are totally deranged, but others...
