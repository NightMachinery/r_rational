*tl:dr; this is the companion thread for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9t68lt/biweekly_challenge_spooky/][the biweekly challenge]], post ideas, recommendations, or general thoughts below.*

There's an interesting distinction to be made between "spooky" and "scary", namely that "spooky" encompasses a lot of things that borrow the iconography of "scary". At least some of this is done to make scary things palatable to small children, who frighten easily; it would be hard to sell Halloween paraphernalia like cookies, candy, costumes, etc. if you're frightening away your primary consumer.

(Now that I think about it, this prompt also has a bit of overlap with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/67zt5y/biweekly_challenge_monster_mash/]["Monster Mash"]] from a year and a half ago.)
