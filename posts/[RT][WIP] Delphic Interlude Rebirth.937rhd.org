** Another great chapter. Does make you wonder if Doc managed to clone Jack or something similar, to let him go so easily.

***** I couldn't remember off hand if we heard about that from his/a potential victim's point of view, or from the public story/a government team's point of view.

If it was the former then yeah, my point is wrong, but I couldn't remember if that was the case or not.

****** A reasonable government does not divorce itself from an asset with the positive public image that doctor stephens cultivates without an immediate, pressing, unavoidable crisis.

In a post super world, the US did this. Makes you wonder what really went on. Must have been a serious threat.

******* Having just reread the chapter, it looks like the testing he's been doing was basically a PR disaster, and in Stevens' statement, he seems to indicate that he personally thinks that everyone involved would have consented, which implies to me that, in combination with the description that a significant number of people were conscious, that many did, in fact, consent, and that he simply kept his studies secret because super research is icky or something similar? I'm not sure when modern medical science started doing dissections to better understand human biology, so maybe that was part of the alt-history?

I could also just be grasping for potential excuses for his actions and I'm 100% off base, but not seeing any commentary from his victims in the criminal case interlude is a bit... surprising?

******** You'd think that, with the world being much less stable, and the need for assets like Stephens being so strong, the government would have accepted his actions had they been so benign. Hell, I would think they would helped him keep it hidden.

This makes me suspect it worse.

**** I think it's that, even though Eutopia took him in, they still don't give him total free reign. Maybe they did back in the day, but since then they seem to have become some kind of thriving Super paradise, and as none of their powered people seem to feel scared or threatened, I'm guessing that it's no longer the kind of country that would condone holding a superhero against his will to study his powers.

This could be less about Doc Stevens, and more about Eutopia being a country willing to tolerate and use his talents, but not actually give him the authority to just do what he wants.

** Yanno, I was really worried about doc being behind whisper's kidnapping... But now, I actually think LL is the culprit.

She tried to keep delphic out of it when looking, because she knew spinner wouldn't find anything. Yeah, that could be because of his ties to Doc, but...

Whisper is one of the biggest detractors of their torture sessions. And she is the best target for someone who doesn't want a whistle blown over it. If she "escaped" then she would be discredited. Plan B, if she was killed, all the supers in New York would have lost their minds trying to catch the killer. The torture method would have got traction.

It was LL that refused to allow them to take her away from the hospital until the doctor came. And had spinner not been able to see the future, whisper would have been killed right there. Her reasoning for wanting the doctor (who apparently kidnapped her) to check her out, made no sense. They needed a 2nd opinion if anything.

She was the first to know about whisper being found and the kill order happened within minutes of them showing up. /someone/ on the NYST is in on it. And LL is the most fishy.

Furthermore, LL has been stiring up other things about this case: telling refraxx delphic was decorating an office friday and only spends a hand full of hours on work. I'm willing to bet she also gave whisper that case file of the girl she killed too.

** 'grieved you': I feel as though I've come across this usage of the word in A Practical Guide to Evil (though it could have been elsewhere?), and thought it was a deliberate twisting for a different culture; by understanding is that this should be 'mourned you' or 'grieved for you', not 'grieved you'.

I wonder if no one told Jack about contraception...

*** Both usages are correct. You can use "grieve" with a direct or indirect object with the same meaning.

**** \*searchity, checking against own impressions\*

[[/r/https][r/https]]://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grieve#Verb

​

My updated impression is that when you grieve a person you make that person upset (make them experience grief, 'to make sad'), but when you grieve an inanimate occurrence it's the same as grieving regarding it..? In any case, by previous impression definitely appears erroneous!

***** Here's Oxford Living Dictionaries:

[[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/grieve]]

It looks like it would be more correct, and less ambiguous, to either say "grieve for [person]" or "grieve [person]'s death." If I want to just say the verb with the person, I'd be better off using "mourn."
