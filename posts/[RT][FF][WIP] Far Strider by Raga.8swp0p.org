As a note, I started this as a speed writing challenge to myself. The challenge was successful, and I managed 100,000+ words (as well as some character sheets in excel and such) over 10.5 days. Then I had to stop and let my hands recover from their burgeoning carpal tunnel syndrome. The story currently stands at around 150,000 words (or ~550 RRL pages) over 54 chapters; expect a chapter a day until I've caught up with the backlog.

The focus of this story was not quality writing, and that hasn't changed. I mostly use it as my semi-guilty "I need to write something, but am not focused enough to write something good" story. Expect self-indulgent writing in general, and a bit of OP (or, well, more than just a bit if we're being honest), especially later in the story as the protagonist matures into a more full-blown Planeswalker.

But if you're looking for something with a power-ramping protagonist romping around the place, something you'd be a bit embarrassed to admit liking (I know I am) but like anyways (and come on, this is RRL, so that probably describes just about everyone here who actually has shame), then this may be a nice bit of mental junk food for you.

** The problem with Mary Sues is not their power level, it's they way the world has to be warped around them.

EDIT: Maybe you're posting this because it gets better later?

*** I've read all of it. It doesn't, really. I could see it being enjoyable, for some people, but it has a bad case of protagonist centered morality, and the world continues to warp around the protagonist.
