The "Bad Guys" in Kiseijuu are almost perfectly rational, you could say that they think like an AI might. The main character also behaves similarly in a way to how Harry does in HPMOR, with regards to developing a coldly self-interested 'Dark Side'.

If you feel this does not belong here, feel free to remove, also not sure which tags would be appropriate, so sorry about that.


** Content note: Graphic violence, gore, cannibalism (sort of), death, murder, PTSD, body horror, betrayal, sadness, and mild cursing.

Edit: also, sexual assault.

That being said, none of it is gratuitous. It's all done because the logic developed in the story and the rules of the world require it.

Rational, but not rationalist. A lot of organizations that are often portrayed as incompetent are instead competent. Subverts a lot of dumb horror tropes. There are predictable twists, but many of the main characters, even the secondary main characters, act savvy and smart. The girl doesn't go to investigate the strange disappearances alone, she brings a weapon. The police don't go in willy-nilly and die for no reason (well, maybe at first), they realize they're dealing with a new kind of enemy and develop new weapons and tactics and try to account for all possibitiles. They also choose their priorities carefully.

**** Judging by ratings and reviews on mangaupdates and anidb, they are pretty much equally awesome. It comes down to which medium you prefer in general. I'll wait for Blu-ray releases and then watch it in one sitting. I've read manga 5 years ago and don't remember what it was about at all. The only thing I remember is that it was interesting.

**** The manga is very good, but is pretty old. They've done a great job of modernizing the material for the Anime, and I would probably start there.

***** I agree with watching the anime. It's available on Crunchyroll and pretty excellent. Don't expect ufotable budget and production value, but the studio that worked on this was very clever with their budget and making the anime look good. The visuals are as better than you'd expect for what they'd spent on it. The soundtrack is solid and even includes tasteful dubstep.

** First episode has CGI animated background people, which is a clever way of reducing still image shots most animes have to fill in the frames. Will ad more reviewing later. EDIT: Spoilers btw So far in the first episode, the protag has: stopped a parasite attack by cutting off his own bloodflow with speaker cords, attacked the parasite with knife and researched on internet about his parasite condition. HOORAY FOR RATIONALITY Continuing on: The parasite IS LEARNING ON ITS OWN by reading books and transforming into animals it sees on the page, the protag is planing to cut off the parasite surgically and the parasite is negotiating with him, another parasite is trying to kill the protag before he notifies the authorities of the parasitic existence.

OK that's it for ep1. I find this sufficiently rational. For now.

** It is rational and a good fit for this sub. Shinichi's 'sidekick' is always looking to optimize results. I did feel some of the plot twists coming from a mile away though. Still it's worth watching.
