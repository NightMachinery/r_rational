Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are suddenly teleported onto a pristine, human free version of Earth. You are naked, unarmed, and alone. Luckily for you, it seems to be a nice, warm spring day. The wilderness reminds you of Canadian woodlands, a place known for harsh winters, bears, moose, wolves and .

You get a psychic message that informs you:

You must survive ten years. After that you will receive a chice to be teleported back to your world.

You get ONE minor superpower: you can copy any object. The object must fit through a ring between your index finger and a thumb: extra copy will appear out of thin air nearby in about 2-3 seconds.

How do you survive? How do you max the utility of your power to maximize the chances of survival?

*** If I understand this correctly, this superpower is not so minor, basically doubling any glandular or fluid material with a 3 second doubling time. If you have a sand grains worth, and duplicate it for 1 minute, you got slightly less than a solid cubic meter of the stuff.

If you take some random insect, and find a single palatable organ - the liver is a good bet - you can eat yourself just as fat as if you had unlimited money on McDonalds. Find a single berry and duplicate it for unlimited fruit and juice to drink. If you don't like insect meat you just need to find or capture a single dead mouse or sparrow. For flour, you can crush just a single random grass seed - the choice of wheat and moren breeds is just for larger yields and being easy to farm - between two rocks thoroughly /once/, and you can duplicate the finished product with no further labor. You probably don't need to walk even 5 meters from your spawning point to find ALL of these, and it's not een particularly difficult in the winter. I expect the resulting diet would be superior in quality and variety to what most people can afford in the modern day.

For energy via fire, experiment with animal fats from insects, pollen, seed oils, from whatever you can reach without even needing to get up from where you sat on the ground. No need to know what it is or think; it's just a few minutes of experimentation to find the best combination in terms of ease to handle and not being gross, all the possibilities will have more than enough energy, and if it turns out to store badly you can just do it again. So you have an extremely flammable sludge, by the cubic meter. Copious amounts of this together with random plant bits will let you make a massive bonfire every night that stays lit until morning, although it might need a few nights of practice. You don't even need a house for winter you could just brute force it with infinite energy making bigger fires. If you manage to make ANY steam engine; not an industrial revolution one, the absurdly inefficient ancient greek one - you've got infinite labor and energy. Efficiency doesn't matter. If you find a chunk of magnetite and wrap a gold wire around it a handful of times, you can have a hundreds of those going at once to get as much electricity as you need. Not that you'll need any.

For building you'll probably want clay. Grab a handful of random dirt, a flat rock, and mix it with water. you can make really shitty clay by washing it, just a few grains. dupe that up and mess around with it like a 3 year old during recess, no thought or knowledge required, and you'll eventually have some of the component grain types act differently and change relative concentration. Keep duping the best ones up, and after not to long you'll have magnified the singular ideal grain that was in that dirt, at a concentration that if you didn't have the power you'd have to sift through a many cubic meters to find a single grain, and made high quality clay. Since you can optimize for grain shape, and grind and crush identical duplicated grains into non-identical ones and repeat this, with a bit of work you might even get weird nano and metamaterial properties in your ceramics we even with modern tech can only make small amounts of in the lab.

From this, you can make legos. Again, you have unlimited supplies and zero time pressure, so you can experiment with different design and practice to get good - the sculpting of clay is one thing you'll ant to get really good at. Make sun dried ones to test, then when you've decided on your standard you dupe a bunch of wet ones and throw them into the fire. Now, a fire is not a clay baking kiln, you normally need the temperature to be right, a proper environment, something for the clay to rest on, etc... but if you throw in HUNDREDS of the things 99 times they'll crack and shatter, but you only need ONE to come out successful. I recommend a design around 4x4x50 cm, using a standard stick to poke holes on one end and add clay cylinders on the other.

Or if you feel like it you can skip clay, and try panning for gold. No need far a pan, good technique, or anything else; you only need 1 grain, and even if it takes 100 times as long as if you had those things to just use your bare hands it's not with the time investment. Then you infinidupe it, and you can make your lego from solid gold. And then build your entire house out. of. 100%. solid. gold.

Regardless of if you use gold or clay, you just start building. You can dupe the parts as fast as you can place them down, and there's no need to even lift them since you dupe them already at a height above where you're going to place them. You COULD make a quick survival hut like this, but it's literally as easy as playing minecraft and you have all of your needs seen to, so you might as well make it a giant castle.

I could go on forever with this, but I think I've made my point. Also, note that most of this does not need a skilled survivalist or a scientist, most of it is stuff a 5 year old would probably figure out faster than both those adults. Your only REAL problems would be boredom and loneliness... but you can probably with a bit of experimentation to figure out the exact rules and definitions, and spending MONTHS thinking about the problem rather than the 5 minutes I have, figure out how to cheat in larger things, and then /duplicate yourself/ for a copy-clan of company and labor.

*** Ok, let's see...

First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the environment will try to kill you, and you should try to tackle the most imminent murderous forces first. Your cheat-code is probably the only thing that can make survival possible.

Canadian woodlands means that the nights will be cold, warm day notwithstanding, and hypothermia will kill you. Since you can survive one day without drinking or eating, but not one night naked at below fifteen Celsius, that's your most urgent priority.

After that you will need water. Water means fire, because you need to boil it if you don't want to risk diarrhoea and hence a rather swift and unpleasant death. Boiling it entails (at minimum):

- firewood
- fire-starter
- a sharp and pointy stone wedge

Boiling will be a hassle because you won't have a suitable container, but we can make do.

Food and other necessities can be left for the morrow, or if you have time left after these two.

So, first thing first, try to find a fibrous plant, a weed would be best. Ideally something relatively dry, with a narrow, thin and flexible stalk that can be bundled and used as a simple string. Ferns and similar vegetation could also help, but you will need the weedy strings anyway. Take care to walk carefully and avoid cutting the sole of your feet, they're not callous yet and that could mean game over very quickly (and painfully).

As soon as you have one or a handful, copypaste it so that you can make bundles. Sheaves as thick around as your thumb-index ring shall suffice, and the length you should aim for is something between two and four feet (you can measure with your literal feet). You will want to tie the sheaves together at both ends and in the middle, but make them loose enough that you can estimate ten percent of their volume is air.

Keep one sheaf with you wherever you go, if you lose camp before night and you don't have one, you'll easily die.

Find a good spot to place your camp at. Ideal would be an empty and relatively shallow cave, but good luck finding one. Second best would be on a flat spot on the ground against a flat earth wall in a dry spot, and secluded as possible. In any case you should go for secluded first (for predators and weather), then flat (no running water in case of rain that can wash your bundles away), then dry (better insulation against the cold). Attempt to remove as much debris from the ground as possible.

Multiply your sheaves like there's no tomorrow if you want there to be one. Then look for a sturdy but breakable branch, copy-ring in radius, straight and possibly five/six feet long. If you can't break it look for something narrower, but thick is best (that's what she said). Take it back to camp and make a couple dozens of those. Reserve one for firewood.

What you should do is make a bed of sheaves in two to four layers, coffin-wide for easy entry and exit but also good for keeping the heat in, then line it with sheaves in a tent shape, that is, balanced against each other across all the length of the bed. Think house of cards. Try to go for two of more layers.

To prevent the roof of your shelter from falling at the first push, plant the branches in the ground all along the sides, so that they cross at the top like a tepee. Since you don't have resource limitations, try to make two sturdy and dense walls of bundles and wood.

In the unlikely case that you found a cave or an earthen nook, do the same but against the vertical wall, while planting the branches even more strongly.

Now, depending on your luck, this might have taken as little as four or five hours, or as long as the whole first day.

Anyway this comment is getting long, let me know if you care for more.

***** Then more I shall post.

Remember, when you sleep, to fashion covers for the top and bottom of your small shelter, in order to keep the heat in. This might mean too much carbon monoxide in the air, but it's better than freezing. Leaving a small opening could help in this regard.

Ok, so either half a day or a whole day has gone by depending on your luck. You'll want to continue with the water quest or rest for the evening, or get on to it when you wake.

[Note here, if it's not as warm outside as it was the previous day, you might jump ahead to the making of emergency, temporary clothing.

To do this you will want thinner bundles of weed and possibly fern, a quarter of the diameter of the shelter bundles or less, shoulder to mid thigh in length. Make one and multiply, then bound them in two panels as wide as your torso (use some weeds to bind the bundles in a chain, one to the next, going through the middle, trying for a very tight rope ladder). Use even thinner, more flexible bundles to tie the "top" with multiple shoulder straps, two thirds of a foot between the two panels. Try it on.

Now use similar strips to connect the panels at your hip, leaving again a bit of play. Fold and crease the panels at the same height, so that they will leave you free to walk. If it's cold enough, you may want to add bundles on the sides.

This cover, should it be necessary, will last you long enough to start weaving in earnest later on. Also if you're efficient it can be built in under one hour, given you magical powers.]

Now for water. Counter-intuitively, the first thing you want to get in order to have drinkable water is a sharp rock. Look for a big rock, then find some smaller ones that are a bit larger than your fists. Not all rocks break the right way, you will need to find different kinds and try them.

Break the smaller rocks by throwing them on the large one, until one breaks in a wedge shape, then break some smaller fragments until you get one that is about as pointy as a chunky arrow tip.

{Now you'll need to find a fairly thick length of wood, better if it's a soft wood. You'll need to use the wedge rock against one end, so that the grain starts to split in the middle. Take care to split it as cleanly as possible, separating the wood grain by muscle power after it begins to split, then use some rock edge to carve as much of the core of the branch as possible, making two halves of a cup (a long cup). Later, when you're better prepared, you will be able to use resin as tar for sealing the two halves, but for now just go for the simple solution.

Use strings of weed to tie the two halves back together, and you got a very basic container for water. Keep the rocks and the container with you. If the container is thin enough, duplicate it to keep one in reserve, but this is not necessarily essential.}

[EDIT: I've thought about it, and the previous paragraphs are still worth remembering, but there's an even simpler and faster method for making an improvised bottle if you find the right materials.

Look for any kind of hollow stalk plants like cattail or horsetail, or with a very soft core that you can pierce with a thin twig, like wild fennel, or indeed any sort of straw-like plant, then string a handful of them together and use them as a simple cup.

I would suggest though to first drink a few sips and wait some half hour for adverse effects before you drink from them, just for safety.]

Now you need to find a source of water. Going downhill is the easiest way, as smaller rivulets and dew will converge there. Be careful not to lose base.

After you've found the source of water, here comes the hard part. Break another relatively thick branch in half with the stone wedge. If you feel confident enough in your crafting skills, try to split the half branch again to a small plank of wood. Using the pointy rock you made before, carve a small indent close to the edge of the "plank", by twisting clockwise and anticlockwise the stone point. Go from one face to the centre, then go from the other face to the same spot.

Making a fire is not easy, especially if you've never tried before and never saw it done. I'll write the procedure in a following post later.

Cheers.

***** A bit of delay, sorry.

I made a mistake before, don't drill the notch on the plank from both sides, but only on one side and then cut a small v-shape from the edge of the plank to the centre of the notch.

So, making fire. You carved a notch in the small plank of wood, and you need to find a straight stick with the same diameter as the notch. then you need a flat nonflammable surface, like a rock, green ferns, moss, or a large leaf to collect the embers.

If you make fire for boiling water, it's immensely easier, given your resources, to do so near a stream or river.

Prepare beforehand by gathering a handful of the driest twigs you can find (and multiply), some fluffy-dry tinder to place the embers in, and some progressively thicker twigs and branches. Some examples of tinder are cattail fluff, dandelion fluff, dry weeds, crushed dry leaves and smartphone applications. If you don't find anything fluffy and dry enough, you can make do with wood shavings to be obtained with a sharp edge of a rock, and then beating them between two rocks to reduce them to small bits.

Bundle the tinder in a bird nest shape, loose enough for a bit of air to blow through. You can put this nest in a further bundle of kindling, as it will have to go there eventually anyway. It's also easier to arrange the rest of the wood in a tent shape, with the thinnest wood on the inside and progressively more meaty branches on the outside. It also makes sense to surround the fire-pit in rocks, for safety and for keeping the burning coals all together.

Now for some exercise: place one end of the straight stick in the notch, place the nonflammable surface under the notch, place your palms in a prayer shape at the top-end of the stick, and spin back and forth. You can use a foot or both feet to keep the plank from wandering all over the place. You need to press down a little, which means that your hands will slide down, at which point you will put your arms back at the top and keep spinning without losing too much momentum.

You need to go as fast as possible while keeping in mind that it will take minutes. Your arms will burn and you hands will hurt. Keep going.

After a while, the place of contact will start to squeak like old wooden flooring. Keep going. You will notice some wood powder accumulating out of the v-shape onto the nonflammable surface. Keep going. You will start to get a bit of a burnt smell. Keep going, you're almost there. The wood powder will start to smoke a little. You're there.

[It's possible (or even likely) that your first try will fail, so keep that in mind and don't be discouraged.]

Now take the smoking embers and blow /gently/ on them, so that they start to glow and be consumed by a fire-less glow. Place the embers at the centre of you tinder nest, blow on it a bit until even more smoke comes out, gently close the nest around the embers, gently blow until even more smoke comes out, softly wrap the nest in the kindling and then in thin twigs and swipe the thing back and fort. A lot of smoke should come out, probably more than you would expect, which is perfect.

After a while of you doing this, the nest and twigs should hopefully catch on fire. Quickly but carefully place them under the wood tent that you prepared beforehand, and if everything goes well you'll have your own small bonfire. Achievement unlocked!

Multiply sticks and add them to the fire until it roars, being careful not to suffocate the flames. Multiply even more sticks for later, and add a couple of thicker logs to stabilise the fire.

Then comes the water part.

*** You should not want for clothing or caloric intake, at least once you've produced the first few items of each. You can replicate wheat seeds in significant quantity by putting them in a narrow cylinder, though milling them would be an issue---maybe rice would be better, especially since it's less temperamental to grow. By the same idea you could replicate rolled-up textiles or leather, once produced, and you'd only need to spin a single thread to get started---and once woven, you could replicate the finished fabric as much as you want.

You might also be able to replicate things like arrows, if you could figure out how to make an effective bow. Almost certainly you'd have a surplus of rudimentary spears, tent-pegs, and rope, again conditional on you actually figuring out how to make those things, which is absolutely not a given.

One big issue is that a pristine Earth lacks most of the carefully cultivated crops we're used to. Even the early agriculture versions were much easier and more productive than their wild variants. You /might/ be able to find [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_rice][wild rice]] (which despite its name isn't strictly rice), but it's not a given. Most of your grains will be tough, weedy grasses that take a lot of work and aren't super palatable.

On the plus side, animal sources should get easier. Fish sticks should be much more plentiful with rivers and lakes unpolluted and undepleted. Large game will be more common and lacking wariness of how dangerous a human can be with a bow or spear. (Which aren't trivial to make from scratch, but still quite doable)

Also, there are issues with preservation and spoilage. Perfect duplication means everything goes bad at the same rate. You're dumped into spring luckily, but making it through the first winter will still present serious challenges.

Winter should actually make everything easier since you'll have access to ice for food preservation. You could build an ice house and then fill it after finding the first decent icicle you come across, then restocking it as needed throughout the remainder of your stay. The bigger the icehouse and the better you insulate it, the longer the ice will last and the less you'll need to work on restocking it. For insulation, you could either use a hair or a down feather and then copy it until you're copying entire wads of insulation to stuff into the gap between the inner and outer walls, floor, and ceiling of the ice house.

If you make the floor of the ice house out of wood poles covered with melted beeswax, and give it a gentle slope, you could also drain the meltwater into a cistern to be used as a supply for irrigation, washing, and potable drinking water for three seasons per year.

You could build your home on a hill or slope to avoid flooding, to manage standing water and rainwater drainage (especially if you build a basement), and to easily drain sewage away from your home. You could build the ice house (or else a rainwater cistern) up the slope from your home. This would allow you to set up a pressurized water source for taking showers. Pipes and pipe fittings could be made with fired clay pipe sections, bored-out poles of wood, or semi-flexible tubes of beeswax wrapped with a leather support, or woven support made of natural fibers.

If you want hot water, you could simply make a long coil of fired clay piping and run it through a clay firebox. While showering, you could control the water temperature by diluting the hot water with more or less cold water. The cold water could be run through a semi-flexible tube of wrapped beeswax (possibly blended with tree resin or tallow to make it more pliable), and you could place a tray to hold rocks on top of the tube. More rocks would increase the pressure constricting the tube resulting in less flow so the blended water coming out of the shower would becomes hotter.

Your sewage system could also divert the water in different directions, so used shower and sink water might be used to irrigate any plants you're trying to cultivate, while toilet water could be directed to a niter bed so that you could procure potassium nitrate and, after about a year, you could start making gunpowder.

*** The 2-3 second limitation forces you to bundle really small items that you need a bunch of together into one “item” but other than that it is easy to work around. Duplicate one small item a few times, bind it to its copies into a bundle, duplicate the bundle, attach the bundles together end-to-end, repeat until you have a long bundle of convenient size.

In addition to general_obvious's ideas, you could do long strips of dried meat for food.

Once you've got one good piece of long, thin, smoothed, notched wood you are pretty set on basic building materials. If you planned your notches carefully and made them matching sizes you could make it so that you could interlock one piece of wood with duplicates of itself in useful ways that require a minimum of lashing, mortar, glue, or resin to hold together.

For advanced comforts... if you manage to find some native copper you'll be set on metal if you can get so much as a single piece. Even just a nugget would be good. For that matter, you could try panning for gold. Even a single speck of gold could be duplicated until they are a convenient number to smelt into a larger piece to be duplicated. Gold is a soft metal and thus easy to work and doesn't corrode easily.

*** Survival is trivial. You have an infinite supply of wood for heating, cooking, and light. You can make an infinite supply of food. The real question is how close can you get to modern civilization in ten years.

[[/u/ArmokGoB]] has pointed out that getting clay would be trivial regardless of where you start. I'll add that once you have clay, you can easily start making kilns and then start making clay bricks, clay pottery, and clay piping.

Iron would also be fairly easy to make. You can use clay and wood to make charcoal. You can use your blood (or some other mammal's blood) as an initial source of iron. You can make an open-hearth furnace with a tall chimney so that the stack effect provides for a suitable intake air supply. Place the blood in a clay tube, copy repeatedly, get a large volume of it, then boil it all down to a solid cake. Copy the cake until you've got maybe 100 lbs. Put the mass of dried blood-cake into the furnace and get it extremely hot, enough for what little remains of it to become a white-hot mass of liquid - all other contaminants will be hot enough to be evaporated at that temperature, leaivng behind about 4-10 grams of mostly-iron. Use a clay ladle to scoop the slag off the surface, then let the iron cool, copy it, and start making iron of increasing purity. You can tinker with the iron chemistry by reducing or increasing silicon and carbon content until you have an iron or steel product that you're happy with.

You can use the clay to form molds and create an iron anvil. You can now start creating cast iron and wrought iron tools and parts. One of the initial big projects might be to make a furnace box and boiler for a steam engine to provide power for a metal roller so that you can start mass-producing sheet metal from your metal rods, allowing you to easily make various other components. This might be achievable within weeks after arrival - years is hard to imagine.

**** Oh good catch with the blood. Speaking of which, once you have some form of engine, and steel, one thing you'll want to make is a high-powered centrifuge, for separating out all the myriad substances that are in everything and exponentially "zooming in" on them in enrichment. Lots of drugs can be made from almost any living cell, in theory you just need a single molecule of it to be in your sample and you'll get it /eventually/ with the centrifuge on high enough power. Also from just a drop of your own blood you can get infinite supplies off phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, flourine and zinc. Calcium from a shard of bone. Copper from a handful of soil. etc.

EDIT: Oh and some other tricks that might be handy: If you ever need clean water in an energency, not having fire handy to distill it, you can just duplicate and drink your own spit. Likewise, if you ever run out of food and cant find even the smallest insect, you can bite your own tungue and survive on drinking large amounts of your own blood.

Also, for clothing, ropes, and anything else you might need along those lines, just use spider silk, it's even sticky so attaching the strands into arbitrary length is trivial. This in general will replace everything you might normally use plant fibers for, and is stronger than kevlar or steel wires that we can make with our current technology for these purposes. For warmer clothing, you can duplicate your own body hair in an emergency, or take down from some small bird you find; presumably lots of more common birds have some down better than even eiderdown just in extremely small amounts and with no reasonable way to gather more than fractions of a gram.

*** Get a pointy stick, since the bears and wolves and such won't have learned their lesson about humans yet the way ours have. Hope you don't have to use it.

Look for: Nuts, berries, seeds, a running water source, dry moss, sticks of various thickness and dryness, clay, various fibrous plants, rocks that break with sharp edges, and a type of plant that grows large water-shedding leaves.

Duplicate and try some of the first nuts/berries/seeds you find, spacing trying new kinds out by several hours, so if something makes you sick you can narrow it down. You want to get on this early, before starvation makes your digestive system weird and makes it harder to figure out. You can put off looking for edible vegetables until later, since that's more hit and miss. Similarly, you'll want to rash test your fibrous plants.

Duplicate dry moss and small dry twigs to make a fire bed, then use the drill method to start a fire. This can be very hard so it's also something you want to do early while you're sharp. Once you have a fire going, duplicate larger sticks that'll burn slower and keep it going; better to never have to start a fire again if you can help it.

Duplicate ropes of clay to get more. If things go very quickly, try to make and fire a pot. If you succeed, you can boil water in it and drink that. If you get unbearably thirsty before that point, you'll have to risk drinking the water straight for a while.

Try various ways of disassembling/reassembling/twisting/braiding your fibrous plants until you find something that feels suitably strong for rope, and something that works for clothes. Duplicate ropes/threads/cords you like. Lash two pairs of long sticks into two A shapes dug into the ground, and another across, then lash your water-shedding leaf on top for shelter.

Once you have fire, food, water, and shelter, you can start improving your food source and shelter. For food you can try bugs, fishing (use a net), and working your way through potentially edible vegetables. For shelter you can start in on a wattle and daub hut, an excellent construction method that uses only long sticks and mud or clay, all of which you can duplicate.

Next up is making a bow and arrow, which can be duplicated, since they're long skinny objects (bow, string, arrow). Get good at that and kill a large animal like a deer. (They haven't learned about humans so you might be able to just shank one with a fire-hardened stick, but the animals will learn soon enough so get practicing.) Try to tan its hide with fire - I have no idea how this works and I bet you don't either, so expect it to take a few tries. Stock up on furs for clothing, blankets, wall hangings, and doors.

From here you're good until the winter. You'll want to upgrade your hut to have a twisted entry and maybe a fur door flap. A second layer of wall, if you can manage (it's Canada, after all). You have infinite firewood, and can duplicate and re-boil the same pot of water over and over again, so you're good on heat and water. Try a variety of schemes to preserve food (drying, smoking, making flour), but make sure you can hunt in case most of those spoil.

If you make it through one winter you can make it through ten. You don't really need to figure out agriculture with one person hunting and gathering in a pristine Earth, but you can try for convenience and something to do. Boredom, complacency, and routine risk taking would be your biggest risks from year two onwards.

*** Does the object need to fit completely through? More specific, if I were to take a long stick could I only stick it partially through and duplicate the whole stick?

If so, this can be used to solve the biggest problem: loneliness and psychological health. I'd simply stick my other index finger through to generate a clone of myself and then I'd have someone to talk to so that I wouldn't go insane after six months or so.

*** Precommitment to drinking wont work. What you need to do is commit to sit down at a computer with the comedtea easily within reach and look at a funny subreddit if and only if you didn't drink, and on a depressing subreddit if and only if you did drink. If you did it right, you can blackmail the universe to chose one of either a funny meme appearing on the sad reddit or a sad meme appearing on the funny reddit. Creepy, but not very useful.

So instead what you do is, you take any event in the world, that either already depends on true randomness, or you can make behave randomly by conditioning your actions on random.org output, and that has a decent chance of going the way you want - maybe 5%. Then you precomit to, if the outcome is not the way you want it to be, you'll roll a 100 sided dice on random.org, and if it's a nat100 you just let it go and do nothing (this is an IMPORTANT safety valve; otherwise you get 'Don't Mess With Time'), and otherwise you repeat the procedure in the above paragraph hundreds of times in rapid succession.

If you did everything correctly, your precommitments and technology and magic are strong enough, and nobody else is using similar techniques against you, you should find that the thing goes the way you want it 90% of the time instead of 5%, and the d100 comes up nat 100 all the times it doesn't (10%, ten times as often as it should).

** I have some CYOAs I am working on. I am having a hard time balancing one of them. It features a super inventor power set: [[https://imgur.com/a/kfd4qZc]]

I wanted to avoid allowing the player to invent anything, but still leave it open ended enough. So I organized it around various advanced materials, components, super senses, and minor super powers. But how far can you get out of a good synergy of these minor capabilities?

On an unrelated note how far can you get with super strength with no secondary powers to support it? (I.e. no tactile telekinesis, no enhanced frictional force, equal and opposite reactions whenever you push something, etc.). At what point does increased super strength stop being useful because you have no way of leveraging/applying it? Also, how much increased movement speed do you get out of super strength?

Oh and the other CYOAs if anyone is interested: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/knjbza/return_of_magic_2020_reset_overview_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]]

*** I had a superhero concept character with the super strength as their power, called Tungsten Man or Tungsten Knight. The idea is, one of the absolute biggest advantages of such a power, especially without invulnerability, is that you can wear MUCH heavier armor than even the strongest human-sized vehicles could wear, and that extra weight on it is actually an /advantage/ since it literally doesn't slow you down. Further, wearing such armor actually solves a lot of the other problems - you have much better grip to use with pushing, much greater energy in your punches before the acceleration gforce will liquify the tissue of your hands, can spread force across a much larger area both on the outside on things you're lifting and on the inside using special padding, can jump much further without air resistance slowing you down to terminal velocity, etc.

It also synergizes way with two other main overlooked advantages of super strength: you can carry a gun normally far to heavy and with far to much recoil for a human to use - in my characters case a rotary autocannon normally mounted on aircraft - and you can carry a comically oversized backpack full of ammo and gadgetry.

Commissioning such a suit, it's a good idea to include lots of gadgetry, and make it also function as hazmat and diving suit and carry its own air supply (so basically, a space suit), making you immune to many of the dangers like toxins and drowning that even favourable superheroes are vulnerable to. It might also be a good idea to ad dynamos to the joints, creating elecricity to power the suit from your movements.

The end result capabilities and looks are a lot like extremely heavy power armor, think 40k space marine - except it can be done with modern realistic tech and doesn't need the power source which is normally the biggest issue with such designs since /you/ are the powersource.

** You are Superman. You want to kill someone on the ground from high above in the sky using your “heat vision”. Your heat vision is actually a ray of radiation that can transmit at energy level, from infrared to gamma ray. You can make it as narrow as you want. The challenge is to kill a man on the ground from the sky without anyone noticing you using your heat vision/ death ray or being harmed. Preferably you want to kill him by exposing his brain to such a lethal amount of radiation that he dies instantly or within minutes. Is there any such way to do this kind of spot radiation assassination? If not would it have to just be through microscopic heat vision burning a small hole in his brain? Thanks.

*** One of the biggest problems here is [[https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Erwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/images/164/16459.png][atmospheric attenuation]] - essentially, air is not equally transparent to all wavelengths of light. Visible light is nearly unimpeded by air, while low-energy gamma rays will be halved every ~35m at sea level.

If it weren't for this, it would be trivial to just induce severe radiation poisoning and/or kill off parts of his brain via a thin and invisible beam of gamma rays. But this isn't possible from high altitudes without making the energy of the beam extremely high and extremely obvious.

You could also increase the energy of the gamma rays themselves, which decreases attenuation, but that also decreases attenuation in the /target/. I suspect that a beam that could penetrate kilometers of air and then induce radiation poisoning in a human-sized target would also severely irradiate anyone nearby, but I'd have to run some numbers to be sure, and a thin beam might not scatter enough to be a concern; anything that doesn't scatter would safely land inside the ground.

Another solution is a less energetic wavelength of light that does penetrate the atmosphere, like infrared. Burning a big hole would be extremely obvious, but a small hole could still potentially be effective. A needle-sized hole would likely self-cauterize without bleeding, but i'm not sure how much of a mark it would leave and doubtlessly it would /smell/ quite a bit. This is effectively laser surgery/laser cauterization on a more extreme scale, and those require ventilation to get rid of tissue smoke.

A slow induced heatstroke might work, but that's also similar to putting someone under a heat lamp, and that's probably pretty noticeable. If you're focusing on the head, then hair would also pose a problem.

Really the best solution here is probably subterfuge of some sort. A lot of assassinations are like this; for example, Georgi Markov's assassination via poisoned umbrella poke. Put on a wig and some sunglasses, sit on a park bench and wait for the target to walk by. Hit them with enough ionizing radiation to kill in days/hours/seconds depending on preference and surroundings and either make yourself scarce or act suitably concerned-bystander. If you do it precisely enough you could probably kill specific areas or target blood vessels to coagulate blood and make it look like a stroke, or make it an actual stroke. Still might not hold up to close scrutiny, though. This probably would not work from more than a few dozen/few hundred meters due to attenuation.

***** There are three obvious paths that come to mind, which can work on just about any sidewalk:

1. Drop something heavy on him, by breaking it off with heat vision. This has the obvious problems of not being guaranteed to kill him, and being likely to be noticed as your activity, especially if people are aware of your activity
2. cook his brain. Use wide-angle heat vision on his entire body, but especially his head. If you heat him up slowly, he might not notice until it is too late. Eventually, he would go into heat stroke and eventually die if untreated. If he notices, he can take cover of course and likely be safe. If done properly, people will confuse this with natural causes until an autopsy reveals that there was nothing to cause the body to overheat like that
3. laser his brain through his ears. You would need to tune the wavelength of light emitted by supermans' eyes carefully such that it has sufficient penetration to get to his brain, but not so much penetration as to go out the other side. You would have to test and calculate this carefully. Then, you would need to position yourself so that you could see straight down the Target's ear-hole. This would be noticeable the astute observer, especially if they were suspicious of you and knew where you were at the time.
