** Aspects is really good, mostly on the virtue of fucking /nailing/ character voice. Sylvester and Blake are right on target, Taylor isn't too far off the mark, and Harry is recognizeable, even in fanon form. Any story that has Sylvester operating on full blast is going to be a fun read, and the extra stuff only makes it more interesting. It's a far cry away from his MCU/Worm cross, although that was fun too.

If I have one complaint, it's that all of the protagonists have typical Cannot Spit It Out syndrome WRT having been reincarnated, and it took a while to move past that. Given the circumstances, it's understandable.

**** I mean, I knew I wanted more Sy, but I was highly skeptical somebody else could write him well. I'm so, so pleasantly surprised.

*** It's good, because the author literally made the fic to work on their character voices. People had complained that in other fics, the characters didn't sound right.

And I'd say he succeeded.

** I got chills when Master-Stranger protocols were invoked. Those protocols are almost rationality in a /can,/ and their presence and execution were phenomenal.

I was really skeptical going into this, but I have to say, it does a great job with the voice of my favorite protagonist, Sylvester; it nails Skitter's cautious mindset and propensity for calculated risk taking (I wanted to clap when she went to Dumbledore); it brings in my favorite existential threats in the form of Pact's demons and Abyss; and the Harry Potter universe... Well, it's kind of the ultimate fanfic canvas at this point because it's so, so established and so much fic has sprung up from the setting.

Oh, and Dumbledore is /great./ Nailed his personality, and he is definitely absolutely /not/ the kind of person who wants to repeat his own mistakes-- Dumbledore makes for a fantastic rational character and he's in top form here.

So I'm calling it here: Voldemort will discover diabolism, because the worst most powerful things from those two canons can't just not glom onto each other in the most inconvenient possible way for the protagonists. Lewis is the top candidate for bringing Voldy on board with Pact's dirty bomb magic.

Which is to say, Wildbow protagonists: they do everything as right as they can with the knowledge they have, and Things Get Worse because reality isn't a game they can just munchkin to win.

I'm just really impressed with this.

** I am not yet sure if this will turn out to be rational, but it has so far avoided being irrational. It is currently in its infancy, but features /several/ competent main characters, which is very rare and promises an interesting experience. They all have different ways of thinking and relating to their problems, as well as emotional reflexes, so watching the contrast between their reactions can be as enjoyable as watching the reactions themselves. We also get interesting takes on what X thinks of Y's thought processes, with some characters showing unexpected depths.

*** I would read Twig first because there are spoilers and the Twig viewpoint character is the strongest of them all in this story.

*** It has spoilers for Twig up until the end, and you will only really apprechiate how good ManMagnificent does Sylvester's voice after having read at least some of the original.
