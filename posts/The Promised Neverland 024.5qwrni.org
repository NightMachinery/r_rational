** Looks like the crap finally hit the fan.

I'm not sure how this ends well at this point. The only weakness Mama seems to have is that she's determined to deliver them all on time without any variations to the plan.

It seems like at this point they have nothing to lose by being openly hostile with Mama, since she already knows exactly what they're planning and more or less knows who's behind it.

The advantage they have is in numbers. With Sister Krone gone, the kids can more easily divide her attention. Have multiple people engage in coordinated suspicious activities, so that she can't possibly stop them all.

But even with tactics like this, the risk is that Mama might eventually decide that things are out of her control and either ship them early, or call for backup again (though that seems less likely to me given what happened to Sister Krone). Perhaps she might even have a way of imprisoning all the kids that she suspects to be part of the escape plan.

So at this point I'm thinking there are really only two options.

1) Rush the plan and move to escape immediately. Take down Mama in whatever way is possible and scramble to get away before anyone notices that Mama misses her next report.

2) Somehow negotiate with Mama (Probably not going to work... but it might be a decent stall tactic if nothing else).

I think option one is the plan more likely to succeed. But both are not great choices. Maybe there's a better option that I haven't considered. It'll be interesting to see where this goes from here.

*** I think the higher-ups automatically know if Mama's heart stops, and it's a lot more difficult to incapacitate her if killing her isn't on the table. Still, there might be a way to do it.
