[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8gx1th/biweekly_challenge_long_view/][Last time]], the prompt was "Long View". Our winner is [[/u/vi_fi]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8gx1th/biweekly_challenge_long_view/dyfo49q/]["Fidelity (A Darker Night)"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/vi_fi]], who should hopefully be getting some special new flair tonight or tomorrow! (Win once to get special flair, win five times to get trophy flair, win ten times for two trophies, etc.)

(Edit: Or instead, the redesign can be pushed through and break custom flair icons. Great.)

This time, the challenge will be [[/u/blasted0glass]]' choice, *Memoir*. Take one of your memories from real life and write about it. Feel free to change names, places, and whatever else (you really should change names at least). Dramatizations are fine, as are obviously fictional elements. The question at hand is: what experiences from your own life could be a rational story? Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit, and that there's some wiggle room on the facts when writing a memoir.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, May 30th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:

Next time will be [[/u/vi_fi]]'s choice, *Shipping*. "There are two obvious directions into which one could take that prompt. The first is to write shipping fanfic, in which case I would prefer them to be as rational as possible (as an additional restriction to a really non-specific prompt). Also, keeping things SFW would be appropriate for a biweekly challenge. The second option with the prompt is to write about shipping, i.e. with characters that ship, or are shipped, and a story that revolves around that fact. (A wildcard third option is to write about naval transportation of goods, or all of the above.)" Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit. If you are writing something NSFW, please tag it. Also, if you're doing fanfic that includes spoilers, please mark those too.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/30*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8k1f64/challenge_companion_memoir/][is available here]].

Edit for anyone worried about me: Though the depicted coincidence did happen, I exaggerated my reaction to write a more interesting story. I'm not doubting reality :)

*** (Thinking about the 'right choice': somewhat after-the-fact, in that there was an earlier choice in service of the goal of again being in a relationship with her--not sleeping with others while apart, even if she said it should be done and it was thought she wouldn't learn about it. To put it another way, there was a choice between deceiving or losing, but only after already deciding she was someone one was going to conceal things from (rather than seeking a relationship with nothing concealed). Even if she never asked, next time they met one could have told her (in sincere pursuit of one's goal) and been telling the truth...)
