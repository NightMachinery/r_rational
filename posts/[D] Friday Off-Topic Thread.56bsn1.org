Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Can a person truly be called a "fan" of a work if he doesn't like the /entirety/ of that work? How valid is the position of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ as my favorite story if, as [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/54bz8l/q_recommendations_similar_to_mother_of_learning/d80kjy3?context=2][this argument]] revealed, I've largely skimmed its lewder sentences in /each/ of my /six/ readings of the book? How valid is the position of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][In the Blood]]/ as my second-favorite /Naruto/ story if I skipped /most/ of the epilogues on my first reading and omitted not only /all/ the epilogues but also /the entirety of Arc 5/ (which makes up eight percent of the story's chapter count, epilogues and author's notes excluded) from my second reading? How valid are the positions of /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/ and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122][The Fountainhead]]/ among my favorite stories if I've always neglected to read the vast majority of each book's climactic speech? (And so on.)

Of course, more clear-cut instances of this phenomenon do exist. I gave up on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887][Wharf Rat]]/ at the end of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887/19][Chapter 19]],* on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10894754][Trump Card]]/ at the beginning of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10894754/20][Chapter 20]],* and on /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ (on all readings after the first one) at the beginning of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/35][Chapter 35]]--so, for those stories, I can very simply say, e.g., "I like the first half (through Chapter 34) of /Chunin Exam Day/, but it's my opinion that the second half sinks too far into bashing and harem shenanigans to be enjoyable." Where, however, is the line drawn between "I like this story, with a few negligible quibbles." (e.g., /Time Braid/) and "I like this /part/ of the story, but hold only indifference or dislike toward the /rest/ of the story." (e.g., /Chunin Exam Day/)? After what particular percentage of the story has been discarded does the overall /shorthand/ opinion shift from one position to the other? I, at least, think it's an interesting question.

*Or, more precisely, I /read/ one or two chapters past that point, but bothered to /download/ only the chapters /before/ it.

--------------

If you haven't read them, by the way, I do highly recommend both /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/. /CED/ starts to get bogged down with boring harem shenanigans in [[#s][Chapter 22]] and descends into pathetically-petty bashing against Sasuke and Kakashi in [[#s][Chapter 35]], while /PKH/ veers closer to the [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_The_Line_Twice]["crosses the line twice"]] end of the spectrum [[#s][as it nears its "end"]]--but both stories contain many /extremely/-cool ideas.

There's [[https://web.archive.org/web/20130525211228/http://plover.net/%7Ebonds/objects.html][an argument]] that fandom (as opposed to general appreciation/enjoyment) may even /require/ a work to be flawed. If a work isn't a mixture of inspiring and flawed, then the appreciators and the detractors aren't sharpening their memes against each other, and (so goes the theory) it'll be difficult for some elements of fandom, such as fan identity, to form.

(While hunting that article I found there was [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/z4/do_fandoms_need_awfulness/][an LW discussion of it]] as well.)

*** I can sympathize, especially since I have a tendency jump ship on long running stories earlier than other fans agree they jumped the shark. I wanted to stop watching Supernatural and Fringe halfway through despite how much I liked the characters, I only recommend the first seasons of House of Cards and Penny Dreadful even though they're only part of the story, I thought Daredevil's second season paled in comparison to the first, and as much as I loved the first 10 or so episodes of Death Note I still pretend the rest never happened.

Of course, there are a few examples where my perseverance paid off. I was disappointed with season 2 of Sherlock only for 3 to blow me away, the middle third of Young Justice season 2 was bland and generic but the rest turned out to be awesome, Madoka Magika failed to resonate with me until the ending made me feel something I never had, and I even thought HPMOR was going downhill near the end with Harry angsting and getting no help from even his parents yet I found the ending satisfying.

There are some other stories that triggered less dramatic feelings in me, though. The first book in the Night Angel Trilogy was the best by far, I liked the first half of Code Geass significantly more than the second, Sgt. Frog is one of the funniest things I've ever seen but failed to deliver after the first season, and Kenshin is still my favorite manga despite a ridiculously long and dull epilogue after Shishio.

I guess in the end you just like what you like and get what you can out of what you can. A lot of what we like is imperfect, which makes it difficult to recommend to those who may not share our feelings toward it. We all have our own masterpieces and want others to love them as much as we do, but they frequently don't. As someone who is WAY too self conscious about what I do and don't like, this is something that shouldn't bother us no matter how much we relate to people through shared fandoms.

This is very well put. I sometimes get frustrated when I recommend something to someone that I know (or think I know) they'll really enjoy, but they get caught up on early imperfections and stop reading/watching rather than share my level of ability to take the bad with the good.

This was my feeling on it too. I'm not sure if I made this observation before or after you finished the trilogy, but I'm glad I wasn't the only one to feel disappointed by the second and third, after how great the first part was.

***** I wasn't actually disappointed with the books as I was reading, it was only when the last book went full high fantasy clichés in its final act that I realized how much the series had thematically drifted from where it began. On the one hand I have to respect a series that starts as low fantasy, transitions into heroic fantasy, and ends as high fantasy; but on the other hand the first book is the most profound by far and stands well on its own.

I really shouldn't complain since I read all of the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow sequels and found Ender's Game to be my favorite by far, but still enjoyed all the rest of them. It's not like my experience with Night Angel was all that different, even the ending in both cases was strange and failed to resolve everything. I've probably just become more judgmental.

*** this is an interesting way to look at stories. most stories i read are not super good only partway through. Either they are very good throughout or they are subpar throughout. Or they start off decently but not amazing in the beginning and either get slightly better or slightly worse as the story goes on. I've rarely if ever read a story that started out really really good and drastically deteriorated as it progressed. The only example I can think of that really comes close is the Bleach anime, and that was only because it kept increasing in filler and fighting without enough plot and character development to make up for it, not because of anything inherently worse about the story or the storytelling itself.

You must be very skilled at finding high-quality novel writing if you can even find that many novels that have high quality beginnings and low quality endings, in addition to overall good works, despite sturgeon's law.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool Bill's PC ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][previous threads here]]):

This last week has resulted in a lot of designs being hammered out.  The new Obedience/Attitude stats replace the old Respect/Loyalty system, which has been moved to the individual pokemon (and not their species definition.)

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e4bMBgsvshUBFShes2bG3RGXIzVYh16EPboqDTdpfA/edit?usp=sharing][A grand list of features has been started]].  This will later be reorganized into a roadmap, but for now it lists all the things we'd /like/ to see in the game, to help me understand how each system needs to be built.

Work has begun in earnest on the Move Making tab.  As part of this, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPZPDEohBhm8y4gbdfGHPv5T1yF7rXnxAzNDpTuLqWA/edit#gid=0][a spreadsheet was put together]] for figuring out what moves from canon can be used in their current state.  This spreadsheet unfortunately does not differentiate between moves whose mechanics will be used and moves which merely have a good name that will be reassigned, but this is the first draft.

A lot of the types were shifted around as a result of this:

- Dragon has been redefined as a damage type to represent /raw energy manipulation/ and as an archetype to represent /rage/. Hyper beam is more than likely a Dragon-type move for both reasons.

- Fairy has been given a purpose: it is a type that has to do with /Light/, both in the use of optical illusions and photonic blasts.  Dark types are not immune to these illusions as they do not affect the mind.

- Bug has been salvaged and redesigned as a damage type that centers around /infestation/.  Parasect spreads a rapidly-growing fungus while Beedrill injects Weedle larva, both of which deal Bug-type damage as they atonomously consume the target inside-out.

- Ground has found itself more or less gutted. The majority of its signature moves are either earthquakes (Earthquake, Magnitude, Fissure), not related to the ground at all (Bone Club, Bonemerang) or actually found to be more rock-type.  The type itself looks like it's going to be more of a defensive, ferocious, bulky Beast type, with the various true earthbending moves moved to Psychic as a subset of telekinesis.  As a result, the more 'pure' ground-types (Diglett, etc) will probably be given partial Psychic typing and a high affinity for those moves.

Fighting is also currently under debate.  It seems to me there is no /fundamental/ reason that something would be hurt by Karate Chop significantly more than it would by Double Slap, so my current idea is to roll most physical Fighting moves into Normal, with Ki-based and Aura moves staying as the true manifestation of Fighting.  I am recieving backlash on this, though, so we're still working it out.

If you'd like to chime in for the debate, feel free to list your feelings here or [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server]].

We also had a certain amount of brainstorming for a name for the project, which IMO was mostly fruitless.  I personally like the "Pokemon Renegade" suggestion the most, but even that seems a bit off somewhat.

This week I aim to finish hooking up the move tab, get a solid release build out, and continue hashing out the type debate.  Once the move tab is working nicely, Bill's PC will be in a good enough state to be able to start working on the game itself, though I will need to come back to add things such as map support, quests, NPC editing, and so forth.

*** Have you considered ditching the "pokemon" theme entirely, for the main engine?

Call the game engine "Ketura's combat monster engine", and then release pokemon themed data files, as a separate entity.

This makes it a lot easier to respond to intellectual property claims, and keep you branding intact throughout.

Nintento asks you to take down pokemon renegade, but fans still know to google "Ketura's combat monster engine" for the latest news about where to find data files for the engine.

This is a really neat way to conceptualize what Bug types attacks are as a distinct physical trait, rather than the emergent-property-types idea of bug pokemon themselves being what matters most.

Why not just make Ground pokemon be pokemon that are more reliant on being on earth/soil, either for mobility or as part of their substance? Bone Club/Bonemerang definitely need to be re-typed, but what Ground moves are more like Rock moves? Most that I can find are earth, sand, or mud related.

To me, Normal attacks that use fists or hands are just blunt damage. What makes Fighting moves Fighting is the intent and strength behind them: basically a Hitmonchan can use a Normal attack like Megapunch by just hitting any part at random, whereas a Karate Chop is a direct attack against an enemy body's weakpoint, like a joint or neck, since you wouldn't Karate Chop someone's face or chest.

Basically, the idea is that everything is Normal unless there's an explicit reason for that not to be the case; it's really more "colorless". Bug buzz seems like a sonic attack and signal beam I think will be reworked to be used as a way point for directing bug minions, so both will probably be retyped to normal.

#+begin_quote

So when I say it's been gutted, I'm referring to the move pool and not the Pokémon, so Earthquake is getting retyped but Diglett is only getting a small adjustment.

Ground is difficult. At times, it represents an Earth type that is so frequently conflated with Rock as to be indistinguishable, and at other times represents a Beast type that is really just a tougher and more feral Normal. It makes sense, I think, to push the type to mean Beast as far as descriptions go; both Sandslash and Marowak fit this archetype fairly well, in spite of being one of the few pure ground types. We can then fold the Earthy bits into Rock and end up with a clearer, albeit sparser, classification.

Which then begs the question, what is ground damage in that case? If Ground is redefined to mean Beast, well, that means it doesn't really define a unique substance to be resisted or weak to.

(Even if we didn't redefine, what creature is weaker to dirt than it is to a rock? Short of inhaling it, I can't imagine such a situation.)

It is in this context that I say that mud slap et al should just be made part Rock, and let Rock circumscribe the whole earth concept. Now that I type that out, maybe earthquake etc can go be rock instead, hmm...

This is primarily what the argument against me has been, and while I've come around to accept that from an /offensive/ standpoint, it doesn't make any sense to me from a /defensive/ one.

If a Machamp hits you with Comet Punch, it's going to hurt. A lot. If he hits you with Cross Chop, it's also going to hurt. A lot. All things being equal on the offensive front , I cannot imagine why a creature would withstand (or even resist!) the first while utterly crumbling to the second, as an aspect intrinsic to the defenses.

#+begin_quote
  Kind of like the distinction between Scratch and Slash.
#+end_quote

So are those different types? Steelix doesn't care whether you rake him with claws or rake him with claws with the intent to make him bleed, he's made of steel and will laugh at you before crushing you.

I would contend that he also doesn't care whether you make a general punch or a highly sophisticated, practiced, honed chop that seeks out weaknesses. Surprise! His weakness is that he's indestructible, and also that he laughs too hard when crushing people.

But wait! People say. Machoke is strong enough to jump up in Steelix's face and punch it so hard it puts a /dent/ between his eyes. Surely this means there's something different between that and double slap! I'd say the only (rational) difference is the amount of training put into it. If Machoke spent a year and a day training nothing but his deadly open-handed double-slap, then I would contend he would be able to face down the same Steelix, jump up in its face, and bitch-slap a dent in its /cheek/ instead.

The only /real/ difference is when we hit chi and auras. /Those/ I am perfectly okay with enshrining as Fighting, because I could see a situation where a creature doesn't care if you punch it, but keels over if you Kamehameha.

This all really stems from the problem of describing Affinities, Archetypes, offensive prowess and defensive vulnerability /all using the same system/. It's nuts, and disentangling it is proving to be much more formidable than I had previously anticipated.

***** Reading through the list, there also appears to be plans for an injury system, perhaps fighting type moves could have a higher chance to injure/injuries cause a larger percentage of unhealable health on super effective hits? That might be confusing though...

perhaps physical fighting moves are still made normal type moves, but with a high chance to injure, and make rock/steel/ice types more resistant to injury, but injuries affect them more.

OTOH, the whole "fighting type is strong to rock" seems to have been based off the classic "martial artist breaks /thing/ with bare hands" which is kinda silly, given the existence of the move rock smash.

I'm also not sure if the system will have a STAB mechanic. If it does, it would make sense for martial arts moves to do more damage if preformed by a fighting type, which should be taken into account.

And then there's the flying type resistance... Ugh, I think I'm starting to grok the dilemma.

****** I think that's my primary issue with fighting: all of the strengths/weaknesses are for the most part "cute" interactions that are geared around easy mnemonics but not actually reflected in reality. The karate master breaking concrete and bending metal, the heroic fighter standing up to darkness, "two birds with one stone" for rock vs flying, etc.

The rest of us are then left holding the bag trying to /justify/ it. I can totally understand why purists would want to twist things around to make it fit as well as possible, but I'm only passingly interested in preserving the original's type distinctions. If it makes more sense to divide things differently, then I'd like to divide them differently.

Your higher injury suggestion, [[/u/DaystarEld]] 's inverted defense mechanic, and [[/u/infernovulpix]] 's sliding skill scale mechanic are all good suggestions, and I imagine they'll go in in one form or another.

STAB will exist, though maybe not at exactly 150% effectiveness, in addition to the Affinity system, which I think will end up being the more impactful. Flying types will already treat Normal and Fighting moves as Flying while in the air, and I think letting Fighting types treat Normal as Fighting is fine, from a strict damage output/offensive effectiveness angle.

I think you might be basing the perception of Ground pokemon too heavily on Gen 1. Which makes sense since that's primarily what the pokemon you're designing will be from, but in later generations Ground pokemon are quite distinct from Rock pokemon.

Especially when you look at partially Ground pokemon: the Water/Ground types are amphibians with a particular focus on mud attacks, Golurk and Claydol are made of mud/clay, and Garchomp is a literal sand shark-dragon. The vast majority of Ground pokemon have some kind of distinct affinity with soil/sand, either for movement or as part of their body.

#+begin_quote
  (Even if we didn't redefine, what creature is weaker to dirt than it is to a rock? Short of inhaling it, I can't imagine such a situation.)

Offensively, mud attacks should stay Ground rather than become Rock because of the similarities in Type with Water (both are strong against Fire and Rock, and resisted by Grass) and burying something in a wave of soil should be distinct from Rock's effectiveness (Bug and Flying pokemon both resist Ground moves for fairly obvious reasons but are weak to Rock moves).

I guess the main difference is again that you're working purely off of substance vs substance, and not tying how hard it is to hit an opponent with the substance into things. But even on that level, I think it makes sense that, say, Grass pokemon have a resistance to attacks that use soil or mud, while not having a resistance to attacks that use rocks.

  If a Machamp hits you with Comet Punch, it's going to hurt. A lot. If he hits you with Cross Chop, it's also going to hurt. A lot. All things being equal on the offensive front , I cannot imagine why a creature would withstand (or even resist!) the first while utterly crumbling to the second, as an aspect intrinsic to the defenses.
#+end_quote

Well, the only pokemon Types besides Normal and Dark that Fighting is strong against are the "hard" types: Rock, Steel, and Ice. Two of them resist Normal attacks as an extension of the idea that they're "very hard," but are weak to Fighting because (in this rationalization) the Fighting attacks are targeting their weak points.

So to get around the issue of why a Charmeleon or Alakazam's weak points aren't so debilitating, how about this?

Instead of having different Super Effective modifiers, physical Fighting type attacks neutralize a % of their opponent's Defense. So for the majority of types, a Karate Chop won't be much more effective than a Body Slam, but for the types with high Defense (which are primarily Ice, Rock and Steel) the /relative/ damage from a Fighting Type attack will be much higher than that of a Normal type attack. It'll be "super effective" compared to a Normal attack, but only as long as the opposing pokemon has high Defense.

And this works the other way around too. Fighting Types are weak to Flying and Psychic and Bug types, and they generally have very low Defense. Realistically if you CAN punch a bird it's going to feel it pretty hard, but there's no real finesse needed there. The Types that resist Fighting are just not letting Fighting benefit from its passive Defense reduction.

Ghost pokemon are the only Type that resist Fighting with a decently high average Defense score, but the immunity is supposed to help with that. The whole phasing thing makes the interaction strange anyway, since Ki is the most effective way to hit them, and it should probably also have the Defense stripping attribute.

  I think you might be basing the perception of Ground pokemon too heavily on Gen 1. Which makes sense since that's primarily what the pokemon you're designing will be from, but in later generations Ground pokemon are quite distinct from Rock pokemon.
#+end_quote

I am biased, you're right, but part of that comes from the fact that they're so similar in spite of efforts to superficially make them distinct:

--------------

Ground is weak to: Grass, Ice, Water

Ground resists: Poison, Rock, and Electric

--------------

Rock is weak to: Grass, Water, Fighting, Ground, and Steel

Rock resists: Poison, Normal, Flying, Fire

--------------

From a pure defensive profile, if you combine the two you get:

--------------

Earth is weak to: Grass, Water, Ice, Fighting, and Steel

Earth resists: Poison, Normal, Flying, Fire, and Electric (and presumably Earth)

--------------

If Quagsire were changed to be Water/Earth, his defensive profile changes from [[http://i.imgur.com/w71MaF3.png][this]] to [[http://i.imgur.com/xNQLTem.png][this]]. If you discount Flying and Fighting (since they're different under this system), the only real difference is that Steel got better against him, Normal got worse, and Fire even worse.

Would we even have /noticed/ if Game Freak hadn't tried to shoehorn the type in? Once upon a time there was a Bird type that was distinct from the Flying type, but they realized this was stupid and merged the two, which resulted in some weird things like Flying being super effective against Bug, but all in all it was a good change. What if they had done the same with Ground/Rock? Would we care that Garchomp is Rock/Dragon? Sand is just crushed up rocks, we would claim, it's still consistent.

I'm very leery of type distinctions that were made for metagame reasons rather than truly justifiable ones. This has that stink all over it.

(Also, even the TCG realized this was stupid, and just lumped Fighting/Ground/Rock together.)

So I'll give those pokemon a bonus to Dig and Tunneling moves. This is an observation of what they're good at, i.e. specific Moves, and not how they inherently, fundamentally interact with other types.

Fire/Water/Grass are all /inherent/. No one ever questions those types advantages because of what they /are/ and not what they /do/. It bugs me that there are then these action-descriptive types that are given the same amount of legitimacy.

You've already picked up on this with your Substance/Descriptive definitions, though I feel now as I look at the list that it's flawed. It should be like:

Substance: Fire, Water, Plant, Electric, Ice, Poison, Rock, Metal, Ghost, Dark, Psychic

Descriptive: Normal, Flying, Fighting, Ground, Bug, Dragon, Fairy

Though Dark/Psychic/Dragon/Fairy are admittedly nebulous sliding-scales and probably have feet in both camps depending on the individual.

It is for this exact reason that I divided physical attacks into Contact and Projectile. Propelling a rock, seed, or bullet of the same size and the same speed should do the same damage, by and large, to a flying type: I see no reason that the rock would bring it crashing down where the seed would actually do /less/ damage, and the bullet's over here like "Guess I have no advantage at all".

Admittedly throwing a dirt clod of the same size and speed would do less. But this seems to describe a weak Earth move, not an inherently disadvantaged type.

Plants tend to die when buried. It's like the elementary school riddle: what weighs more, a thousand pounds of dirt, or a thousand pounds of rock? Answer: they both crush an equal amount. We like to handwave it with the same elementary-school reasoning: "well, a plant can put roots in soil, so obviously it can take getting a fifty-pound bag of it thrown in its face!" I drive a car, so obviously I control and have influence over it, but you drop one on me and I'm gone.

This seems like it would be better modeled with move power: mud slap has 50 power, rock slide has 300. Fire types will react to both unfavorably, but you don't /resist/ the mud slap more than the rock slide, it's just a matter of scale.

The one thing that this stumbles on is Electric; I can see Electric types being interrupted by mud caked on their body where they wouldn't by an equal amount of gravel, but that's more a long-term effect than an immediate damage one. I'll probably have to put something into those Rock/Water mud attacks that specifically dampens Electric attacks for X turns to compensate.

This is a decent idea, and will probably be combined with one or two other ideas to differentiate the old physical fighting moves from old normal moves in the new Normal space. The thing is, though, this is a design guideline and not an inherent type difference: I mean, I'm /fine/ with it, but it's interesting how people jump up and insist that there must be /some/ difference between the two types. People so far don't seem to care /what/ that difference is, so long as /some/ distinction exists, and I'm happy to define a subarchetype within Normal for it.

Come to think of it, subtypes need to be more of a thing. In Magic the Gathering (and other TCGs), one particular faction doesn't do just /one/ single thing, it has a collection of related, yet separate families that work together. Normal could probably have "physical moves, basic moves, sonic moves, and everything else that doesn't have a unique identifier", while Psychic has "telekinesis, barriers, teleportation, and telepathy", Fighting has "chi and auras", etc. Being of one type means that you could sidestep into one or more of the families without /too/ much trouble, but these subtypes don't vary /too/ much from the mean, either.

If it had started that way, I don't think anyone would have gone "Hey, this type is too broad, it should really be two different types!"

Actually the more similar argument is to roll Ice and Water together. In Gen 1, other than Articuno there's no pokemon with "ice" as part of their identity. Hell Jynx is the only Ice type that's not also water, and there's no obvious reason why she's one.

I know you call Ice a "leveled up Water" in Bill's PC, so why not just make Rock a "leveled up Ground?"

I think it's implied that Rocks being thrown are heavier than other objects that are used as projectiles, though. The idea isn't that they're just throwing "rocks," and that the earthy power within them is unleashed on impact, it's that they're throwing boulders, or at least rocks bigger than any human can just pick up and toss around. Sure this could be reflected in Attack Power of each move, but then you're basically relegating all Ground moves to be pretty weak and all Rock moves to be either very strong or rather pointless.

Also when you say "bullet," are you referring to guns, or moves that have the name "bullet" in them?

I actually always saw it more as Plant pokemon being able to dig themselves out if buried or use roots to stabilize themselves/the ground around them in an earthquake or be nourished by mud.

Again though, obviously the substance vs substance goal is the root of the difference here. I don't know how many special rules can be brought up without /some/ implied type interactions, but then, you are turning Flying into a completely special rules Type, so I think I might just have trained myself too well to think in terms of justifying the current type interactions rather than mapping them onto a whole new structure :)

Yep, and this is what I meant when I warned about poor reception among Pokemon fans ;) I think your suggestions by and large would all make the game more realistic, and if you were using your own brand and world I don't think anyone would bat an eye. But it's the age old fanfiction debate, about how much you can change before what you're writing might as well not even use the name of the source material anymore.

Also, in this case I think part of the reason people have that feeling may be because Fighting is such a uniquely placed Type in the metagame. It's so important as a check against Steel and Dark that effectively removing it as a Type really changes the landscape of the game. Tyranitar and Aggron in particular becomes monsters without their 4x weakness to Fighting, though Aggron would still have his 4x weakness to Ground.

But so many other things are going to be different in your game that ultimately it's not going to matter, and the dust will really have to settle before any decisions about balance can really be made.

Yeah, I think that's where "Mental attacks" and similar will be so useful. Ghost, Psychic, and even potentially some Bug and Dark type attacks could have the "Mental" attribute that gives them similar effectiveness or attributes against a specific enemy, even if that enemy's type has a second layer of interactions that reacts differently to all of them.

When I was toying with type pairings I came up with these pairs:

Normal -> Fighting

Water -> Ice

Bug -> Poison

Ground -> Dragon

Rock -> Steel

And though I still feel like there's something there, I'm not sure it would manifest beyond some kind of design guideline rather than a mechanic.

Now that Dragon has been restored as a damage type, it might be better to do Fire -> Dragon and then Ground -> Rock -> Steel. At any rate, these pairings were to describe the archetype and not the damage type; Ground was a tough, ferocious Beast type and Dragon is an even tougher, even more ferocious Beast type.

It's something I need to decide if I'm doing anything with, and then if so probably throw it on the tree as you suggest.

I'm not afraid of players getting access to OP characters because, well, they'll have to defeat OP characters just to have a chance to use them.

So if players go for fighting pokemon, I want it to be for a reason for that playthrough and not because the online metagame drives them to do it. I won't complain if an arena or whatever is set up and people then plan for that, but this game is entirely being balanced around the single-player experience.

*** A cheeky name suggestion.

If Pokemon (ポケモン) is short for (ポケット・モンスター) Pocket Monsters, then perhaps Pokeron (ポケ論) could be short for Pocket Ron (ポケット・論), or pocket argument, debate, discourse. It doesn't really fit semantically, only phonologically*.

If you want to be really cheeky, make it Pokemon Gōri (or Gouri)（ポケモン合理）for bastardized Japanese literally translating as Pokemon Rational. If you have a clever design you can hide the 'ri', maybe in an exclamation point where the lower case 'r' comprises the left half of the upper portion of a rounded exclamation point, and the 'i' hugs the right side creating the appearance of an exclamation point but still clearly spelling 'ri'.

As a separate note, if you're creating a developer's brief or prospectus, you might wish to send it to your local Nintendo chapter to frankly put open up discussions on what it will take for them not to sue you. Put tactfully, to open up discussions as to how both you and Nintendo can benefit from moving forward on the project, possibly meaning Nintendo lends QA to the game once complete and gets a majority or large share of profits, depending on existing or past arrangements of a similar nature. Or, if lucky, gain official license to proceed with a free fan game if that's your intent.

Each member of the DC Trinity is meant to represent a different idea, and her's may be the one most relevant to rationality. Batman is Justice and Superman is Hope, but Wonder Woman represents Truth. She forces people to confront uncomfortable truths about the world and themselves, which is why she's a feminist icon. At least when she's written well, that is.

I admit I didn't really like Wonder Woman at first since I found her to be rather generic in the Justice League cartoon. However, in the comics I have seen her act as the Amazon's official Ambassador of Peace, maintain a charitable foundation instead of a secret identity, and talk both super and mundane villains down as often as fight them.

I found the film by accident and it convinced me she was a character with depth and the feminist themes were well executed. I've heard that Gail Simone's run on the comic series was great, but the best example I've seen so far was in JLA: Tower of Babel where her interplay with the rest of the team showed off her personality and how effective it makes her.

In a story that otherwise felt like an excellent episode of Doctor Who, Wonder Woman ended up stopping a terrorist attack all by herself just by talking to a suicide bomber. He didn't even have a name, he was just a minion for the real villain, but it ended up being one of the best scenes in the comic for how seriously it addressed the situation and everyone emotions surrounding it. She had plenty of other awesome moments in the comic, but that one stood out to me.

I've heard from fans that Wonder Woman actually has one of the smallest rouge's galleries in comics simply due to the fact that she ends up befriending most of her enemies. Don't get me wrong, she's still a badass who's slain hordes of monsters without breaking a sweat, but she's just as much a diplomat as a warrior.

Marvel arguable started the trend even earlier with Spider-Man and X-Men turning genre conventions on their heads.

I have more experience with superheroes outside of comics, but I still think many of the stories have shades of rationality.

A house pet can tell when someone's tone is threatening or happy, and won't react to a smile from a human as though it's a threat. So what if she kept a dog with her and read the human's psychology via reading the dog's psychology? Sort of like a translator.

*** She is not worse than the average dog. She is as good as a dog, maybe even better. It's just that dogs aren't expected to socialize with humans on the level Rachel has to.

Dogs never have to form complex coalitions, keep track of favors, etiquette and fashion, possible betrayals, romance, irony and sarcasm. All those things that Rachel hates.

But Rachel does have the same innate understanding dogs have of human body language. She could tell when Taylor was upset from body language alone, even though Skitter's costume has a mask that hides her facial expression.

- Ran a 5K and lived after finishing in reasonable time.
- Submitted my goddamn paper to the goddamn journal.
- Working 40 hours in a four-day work week thanks to Rosh haShanah and a project where the clients JUST DO NOT GET IT.
- Day drinking on Friday due to the above.
- Gonna try to figure out how to implement Fristonian "active inference" in OpenAI Gym. It's philosophically nice, but can it play video games?

** If my sample of two is anything to go by, dating websites suck (I tried Once and OkCupid).

The way I understand it, dating websites basically take the same problems you have with real-life dating, only you're dealing with them by typing on a keyboard. So women receive a huge quantity of messages, the majority of them going from poor quality to "ey u wana sho me ur tits", which incentivizes them to never make the first step and send an unprompted message, and means they're unlikely to commit to any given conversation. And on the other side of that wall, men need to send lots and lots of messages to maximize their chances of getting an answer, which incentivizes them to send poor-quality, quickly written messages (or even copy-pasted ones) too reach as many women as possible. So on one side you're flooded with attention, often from very unsavory, immature people. On the other side you spend your time sending messages and getting ignored. This sucks.

So I guess I'm done with dating websites for now, unless someone here has a recommendation. I'd also be interested in other people's experience in that domain.

*** I have had excellent success with OKC. Admittedly I'm a poly woman so I'm likely in a different sort of situation, supply and demand wise, than you are?

Here's a list of my "outcomes" from every single in-person meeting/"date" I had:

- Boyfriend ~8 months

- Friendship (was mostly looking for a friend), still maintained as a casual/peripheral sort of friendship

- Conspiracy theorist 9/11 was an inside job/etc. No second date.

- Boyfriend 4.5 years (ongoing, very high chance marriage / etc end-game in this relationship)

My advice:

- be very picky with who you message - do the screening BEFORE you waste time, energy, resources meeting up. Women get a lot of "hey what's up" , so rather than sending 10 really low quality messages, send 1 good message to your top candidate. If I get a message from someone with a match % in the 80s I basically don't bother to reply.

- If you aren't excited by any of the women you see on the site, don't waste your time. Come back every month or so and see who the new flock of single people are.

- Ensure your profile (especially your photo) is high quality. [[/r/okcupid]] is good for this, or I'm happy to have a look. Note that you are trying to sell yourself so don't highlight or even mention your flaws. They don't need to know that you have debilitating OCD that is controlled by medication until they've known you a few weeks.

- Some people are shallow about height so if you're below 5'8" increase your height by an inch or so. (Actually, increasing your height by an inch or so above your real height is probably a good idea regardless.)

- If you're interested in someone and messaging them, don't pressure them to meet right away, but you want to have an in person meeting in the two weeks to one month range or else it might never happen.

- Gently hint to your friends / family / colleagues (as appropriate) that you are looking for a partner, and see if they will introduce you to anyone.

Other comments:

- The size of your metro area is really important here. I had a really tough time when I lived in a city of ~300k but there's several good candidates in a city of ~1.8m. If you live in a small town you might want to look at nearer larger cities, or resort to traditional methods (friends of friends)

- Different dating sites have different specialities. OKC is more associated with the young / alternative / poly / short term relationship type scene, though there's obviously normies there. Eharmony and similar are more associated with the "I need to find someone to marry" type scene. There are others that are more associated with the casual sex / hookup type scene too.

*** Theoretically, [[https://bumble.com/][Bumble]] addresses this problem. I've never used it and therefore can't really recommend it, but it was designed to be a solution to this problem. The woman has to message first. It could go too far in the opposite direction, but because it's so contrary to the norm, it doesn't seem to. In other words, men don't seem to get flooded with unsavory attention and women don't send tons of messages and get ignored. Again, no idea how well it works, but I thought I'd mention it since it does seem to be at least /trying/ to solve the problem you described.

*** OKC does have a section where they publish their statistics and glows. You'll notice that for a guy, information about personality and having a good profile are considered important.

I know that women don't initiate conversation, but they do read profiles recommended to them, and search for people with certain filters. Being prepared for that with a fun, engaging profile with interests listed is a great idea.

If you are a guy with an engaging profile, a DP that makes you look good(not too good though, apparently nudes don't work for men) and are someone who can send fun messages, you'll find a quality partner (short-term or long-term).

Don't give up!

** How to munchkin the housing market:

1) Get a [[https://youtu.be/0EEF9RxQG70?t=99][compressed earth brick maker]].

2) Get a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcrO8ONcfY][robot arm]] for laying them down.

3) With your free building materials and free labor, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl7lZZP21c8][build free homes]] for people indefinitely. Free humanity from the drudgery of having to pay rent.

Does anyone else think this is a workable idea, or is it too pie in the sky? I simply can't see myself working for 4 more decades, so I'm looking for alternatives.

*** Well, the obvious bottleneck is real estate.

Beyond that, houses are more than room-shaped piles of bricks. You need support beams for the walls and the roof, especially if your house is going to have multiple floors (which is better if you want to make cheap housing). You need plumbery and electricity at the very least, as well as windows, telephone or internet access, gas, some sort of heating contraption (I don't know how well compressed earth insulates), and maybe an elevator.

All those things need human labor for now, and are absolutely required if you're going to live in a metropolitan area. On the other hand, technology is evolving, and I think (don't quote me on this) that mass-produced building parts are getting a lot more frequent.

*** That's not the solution I'd go with, personally.

I want to copy "space inflatables". Mylar fabric (ir reflective) double-walled tents. Mylar is generally very cheap. They're portable, and I think everything could fit in a steam trunk.

Where everything includes some way of generating electricity, pumps to keep the tent inflated, water-filtration, water-purification, water-pumps, etc.

I think portability is important for people that don't already have houses. You need to be able to pack up your life, and move off-grid, or move to your cousins property for a few years, or move to a different municipality, etc.

*** This reminds me of the buildings I saw as a result of relief work in Guatemala. They were basically a cement pad, cinderblock walls (with window holes and door frames, but no windows or doors), and a tin roof.

IIRC, they costed <$1000 each, and were about 16' x 20'.
