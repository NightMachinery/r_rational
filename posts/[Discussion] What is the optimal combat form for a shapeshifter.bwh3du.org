This one's bugged me for a long, long time. Okay, /obviously/ a skilled shapeshifter would have a plethora of forms they were proficient in using to defend themselves or kill others and would choose abilities which fit a given situation. But what is the single best body-type/shape if you don't know what you might be facing, whether it be a SWAT team or a giant or dragon or whatever?

Assume you can't create mass from nothing, but you can start with more biomass than a regular adult human if you wanted, the size of a horse at most. Assume the transformation is rapid enough to use before combat but too slow to use in combat. Otherwise, you are constrained by only known physics and possible biology (so if you want flight, you're basically sacrificing everything for it, but you can forgo your entire digestive tract and other organs you can do without for a few minutes).

My first thought is something octopus-inspired, but with six thick, muscular, bone-bladed arms segmented with thick scaly hide and studded with eyeballs. Each segment is equipped with valves which could halt bleeding if critical damage occurs. Unarmored targets are cut to ribbbons, while armored ones are crushed via constriction or pried open like clams.

The primary means of locomotion is turning into a wheel shape and rolling around at very high speed, but could still skitter and climb like spider. With a custom-built brain and anatomy which never had to pass through normal evolution, this form should be able to achieve incredible agility, versatility, killing power, and durability, without becoming dependent on any specific attributes of its anatomy. It could remain functional at any combat task except group-fighting with half of its limbs completely severed, and can drag itself into hiding with only one limb. Toxic gases are a vulnerability but most are too slow-acting to cause fatal harm before it closes air holes and flees, and if you want to /really/ munchkin the shapeshifter carries their own oxygen tanks, guns, food and water supplies to incorporate into this form, but that's beyond the scope of this post.

Edit: *TL;DR Assume no complex tools, no mid-combat shifts, no massive creatures, no grey goo scenarios, no radioactive materials, and you must be able to rapidly kill a variety of unknown enemies.*


** I mean probably the optimal "shape" is a utility fog with multi-modal communication between nodes - everything from infra- through ultra-sound plus chromatophores and biological radio.

In other words, a chittering swarm of bugs.

Even if there's some sort of requirement that all of the shifted mass be attached to a central node, that's /still/ an optimal approach - use your shifted mass to create incubation chambers that'll produce a genetically engineered swarm out of unshifted mass, then use the swarm to wreak havoc from a distance.

Carriers win versus battleships, and everyone else is a battleship.

Please keep in mind that in-universe Tinker Tech required Tinker maintenance, and was therefore limited. So capes relied on their own unique counters instead. But hard-countering bugs? It happened plenty, and every mid-to-late story Tinker fight I remember had a bug counter.

1. Gestation 1.4, (Ch. 4 / 313) 1%, Lung uses fire. This was an available, not a pre-planned counter.

2. Agitation 3.11, (Ch. 28 / 313) 9%, Amy Dallon aka Panacea inhibits Taylor's control of her bugs. Available, but not pre-planned.

3. Tangle 6.6, (Ch. 60 / 313) 19%, Armsmaster's spear, Skitter has to block its electrical effect with her body to prevent it from nuking her hornets. Pre-planned.

And then later in the story (no particular order) we have Coil's Bug Agitating Machine which usurps Taylor's control, Kid Win's Bug Zapping Drones, Dragon's Anti-Bug Steam during the Warden HQ invasion where Bitch ditches Taylor, Bonesaw's insecticides, Mannequin's explosive gas during his second(?) attack this time against Grue after Taylor painted him during the first round, other Armsmaster / Dragon altercations, and Contessa's fire extinguisher deserves an honorable mention.

That's not getting into incidental counters where bug powers just suck, like the Leviathan or Behemoth fights.

That said...

Of course Taylor could have munchkin'ed more, of course she should have lost a lot of those fights, of course there were a lot of villains that were just idiotic and should have at least carried a can of RAID with them but didn't.

But it's a story, and the author put in a solid effort in this regard.

Even ignoring that with superhard (and ultralight, meaning you can have a lot of them) materials in intelligently designed shapes something the size of a bee might be able to just cut through it, there's nothing stopping you from making the notbees naturally be binary explosives, producing two compounds that they can mix to detonate. There are no real species that use this strategy, but it's within the limits of theoretical biology. And as far as I know there's nothing stopping your swarm from being differentiated; some explosive notbees for hard targets, some specialized cutters, etc.

****** Explosives may not be strictly speaking the most efficient way to deal damage, but they're also widely used in human warfare for a reason. I don't know the damage a single bullet's gunpowder would do if detonated directly on my body with some construct to focus the explosion on me (like a bowl or something), but I imagine it would be rather significant. The advantage a bullet has is mostly in being a ranged weapon. Besides, the strength of gunpowder is limited by various factors; the gun and bullet need to be able to survive the explosion, it can't be too easily detonated but has to be able to be detonated by physical force alone, and it needs to be cheap to manufacture.

For kamikaze wasps, these aren't issues. Nothing needs to survive the explosion, so there's no need to either have a weaker explosion or stronger (more expensive) gun and bullet. It doesn't need to be able to be detonated via physical force, as there are many ways to design the biological drone to detonate it thermally, electrically, chemically, etc, but there's no need to make it particularly hard to detonate that way either as long as it's not so unstable that it will explode without clear reason. And as for resources, simple chemical compounds become a LOT easier to manufacture when you combine (super)human understanding and planning with the ability to build novel enzymes... even just the ability to have enzymes that don't normally exist together or in as large quantities produced on demand in situ makes it much more possible, but with novel engineered enzymes, you could make almost any small molecule you wanted, including high explosives.

I think you are overestimating the power of lone gunpowder here, especially given that a small insect is not going to have the weight needed to properly focus an explosion.

However, one option that probably will work is a small tubular grenade made of some strong biological material, such that the explosion shoots shards out each end, directionally. This won't be as effective as a proper gun, lacking the acceleration the barrel provides and the penetrating power the bullet's heft provides, but it should still be deadly. So +1 for changing my mind there.

As to manufacturing novel materials... depends on the prompt, really. I wouldn't write a story where that was allowed, but someone else might.

The key details is that small things have a greater surface area to volume ratio (making it susceptible to forces). They have a smaller distance between surface and vital organs (weak against anything that needs to penetrate, such as heat). This means the ratio of armor-to-content has to be much higher to have the same protection against external threats. A lower mass also makes them more susceptible to poisons/toxins.

I still think that this is the superior form though, due to its flexibility (much like Naruto's shadow clones).

** This question was definitively answered in /The Sword and the Stone/, where the victory was achieved by shapeshifting into *malagolintomontorosis*, a rare, disease-causing germ which incapacitates the opponent.

​

That said, your form would have to depend on the result you wanted to achieve. What is your victory condition? Is remaining undetected sufficient? Do you need to escape? Can you force your opponent to flee or incapacitate them? Or must you kill your opponents? Is there anything else that needs defending? And so on.

​

I'm going to answer based on what I /think/ you're asking, which is: if I'm a shapeshifter and must kill an incoming, unknown threat, what would I choose?

​

Well, my first thought on /that/ scenario is that I wouldn't accept combat on those terms because what is "incoming" might be a nuke (or armed with them). I'd fall back, assess what I was up against, and choose a form based on that assessment.

​

So, let's refine the scenario further. I'm a shapeshifter, guarding an item of some value which cannot be easily moved, but can be easily destroyed, and I'm guarding it against an unknown threat that wants to capture it intact. That limits the amount of force that the opponent can bring to bear enough that choosing to engage instead of retreating is worth attempting.

Priorities are:

1. survival
2. escape
3. item remains intact
4. item remains in friendly hands

​

/Now/ I can start optimizing.

​

As my first two goals are survival/escape, my first task is to impregnate myself with multiple copies of myself adapted to the current terrain, including shapeshifter abilities, and have all of my memories encoded into my DNA; the copies would be otherwise indistinguishable from a life-form that thrives in the current environment, preferably without additional sustenance (i.e., most places on Earth, I'd be reincarnated as seeds which would grow into a grove of sentient, shapeshifting trees; if more than one of me survives, that's /their/ problem to deal with).

Having more-or-less ensured the survival of my consciousness, I would still find the destruction of my current body inconvenient, so I'd armour it. I'd protect myself with layers of limpet tooth bone plates and spider-silk skin. Rather than eyes, I'd distribute photoreceptors (and every other damned kind of receptors I can think of) throughout every layer of my skin, and similarly distribute my neural tissue and other vital functions so that any surviving 10% could reconstitute my consciousness, using the backup encoded into my DNA if necessary. Digestive system can go away for now, as can everything except for a way to take in and filter air, multiple redundant blood pumps and filters, and lots of sugars to use as fuel. Pain receptors would not be disabled, but the part of the neural system receiving the signal would pass along a distinctive sensation (neither pleasant nor unpleasant) that could be silenced to prevent distraction.

​

Okay, so now I'm armoured and maximally redundantly configured. As for the form itself, I would probably configure myself with limbs in the form of as many copies of the Jaws of Life as possible, using hydraulic pressure to tear open or squeeze closed as many opponents as possible at the same time, and then arrange those limbs for maximum speed and agility.

​

That probably wouldn't deal with anything /seriously/ armoured, but I don't think anything organic the size of a horse could do so in the first place.

** What are the main advantages of being a shapeshifter? You're a one-man guerrilla, hiding in plain sight and ambushes should be your main method of attack. Either fast-acting incapacitating poisons, lacerating talons coated in anti-blood clotting substances that result in massive blood loss, or traps you can leave around should be your weapons of choice. Like a saboteur's or an assassin's toolkit.

Scent is also something a shapeshifter might want to experiment with, for creatures that don't see with eyes alone.

As in nature, mimicry takes the shape of your surroundings (for predators) or poisonous/things best avoided (for prey). Your shape-shifting would then be split between hunting forms and escaping forms.

You could also have a preferred form similar to the creatures you hunt at a glance, like a human as [[/u/JAFANZ]] said so you can sneak into towns/cities undetected and can pick off the weakest and most vulnerable targets. Maybe hide your weapons inside your body like an organic transformer and have redundant organs to protect yourself, as well.

** A couple points to consider:

About the rolling tank idea, the problem I see with it is that this kind of movement would require quite a lot of energy to perform and restricts you to the ground. You would be tired in seconds.

You mentioned upper mass limits to the shift, but what about the lower limits? If you can reduce your size while keeping the same mobility and weight by increasing density, you lower your center of gravity and reduce your profile making both striking and destabilizing you harder.

If I had to pick an emergency form, so far would be a cross between a spider and an armadillo with the size of a wolf. Decent protection, good mobility, good reflexes, some jumping power, multiple limbs, poison, decent weight, possibility of weaving a quick trap if I can spare the time. If I can add a bladed bone on the limbs like you mentioned, even being overpowered is not that much of a concern.

*** I don't follow your objection to a wheel mode. Think about how much more efficient a human on a skateboard or bicycle is compared to just running. When your muscles and brain are optimized for this kind of travel, it makes perfect sense to be not only practical but also quite fast. Energy efficiency isn't a concern because we're only talking about /combat/, just a couple of minutes, and boring ‘ol lactic-acid fermentation is good enough for that. Rolling also makes it even harder to seriously injure you while moving, since enemies can can't aim at the “leg” or “head” while your whole body is tumbling around.

I guess you could reduce your mass by just leaving it behind but you'd have to come back for it later, or regrow a digestive tract to process some of your kills.

**** There's a reason why so much effort is going into building robots with legs. Wheels work extremely well on hard, flat terrain, and are absolutely terrible anywhere else. If you're fighting in a parking lot, absolutely go for wheels. On packed dirt? Yes. But on uneven ground or anywhere you cant move in straight lines (building with furniture, forest, mountains, places with tall grass or vegetation) wheels would be a bad choice. That goes double if you are carrying a precise weapon. Pin-point Accuracy is a big problem for large things on wheels. You can ram a torso no problem, but hitting a torso with stinger in close quarters while maneuvering around a shield and trying to evade bullets is a job for legs.

******* Each “arm” is a thick tube of essentially pure muscle, but only one of the six arms is touching the ground at any given time. The other five move to shift the creatures center of mass forward and cause to roll while the sixth arm launches off the ground like a strong kick. As it rolls forward, the next arm curves to catch and balance the creature while it rolls forward, and when the center of mass passes more than halfway over it, kicks as well. Since your motor cortex or whatever brain structure you use to control is purpose built for this as well as crawling, jumping, and climbing, your skill and control are perfect and you should be able to reach much higher speeds than a hexapus normally could.

** You specified that the shapeshifting would be limited to "known biology", so I'm guessing that T-1000 style tactics are unavailable. How fast and how often can the subject change shapes? You mentioned being able to go without certain organ systems for a few minutes, so at least that often. Can the subject shapeshift into an un-injured version of itself for a source of rapid regeneration? Obviously, lost biomass wouldn't be reclaimed, but it'd be nice to be able to shapeshift any open wounds closed again.

"Known biology" suggests that starting your own colony of xenomorphs is out of the question. Does the subject need to keep a vaguely-human brain somewhere in its body for making the thinky-thinks? Is it limited to a single contiguous body, or can it become a cloud of ebola? If the shifter suddenly decides it needs a 50kg bioluminescent appendage, will it be limited by the amount of phosphorous currently in its body, or does it always have the right types of material available for the form it wants to assume?

--------------

I suppose I should actually address the question asked. It depends on the circumstances of the combat. The first scene that comes to mind is that the shifter is being hunted by the FBI and whatever occult monster hunters are aware of it. In that case, the best option would seem to be to not fight at all. If it's fast enough, can traverse any terrain or even fly above it, it can dictate when and where a fight occurs, or even whether a fight occurs in the first place. Bonus points if it has a hand to flip them the middle finger as it goes.

(Making some assumptions about the questions I asked above...)

If lethal combat seems to be inevitable, or the shifter has to defend a target or something, then the brain needs to be protected first and foremost. There are a lot of "truisms" about biology, like "the whole body is just a life support system for the brain", or "the whole body (brain included) is just a life support system for the genitals". Hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys... destroying any of those will lead to death, but mainly because of their effect on the brain. So long as the shifter is conscious and can think, replacement organs can be shifted into being. So the brain needs the best armor biology can buy, and a bladder or reservoir of oxygenated blood that can keep the brain going for long enough to regenerate the rest of the body in the event it all goes south. Backup brains, if possible. That goes for EVERY combat form.

As for the rest... if you're looking for an all-purpose form to be used when the shifter is about to kick in a door and has no idea what's on the other side... well. The best thing to do is /find out what's on the other side/. If, as your post suggests, the shifter takes "a few minutes" to slide from one form to another, then maxing out defense and speed seems the way to go. Once the shifter knows what it's up against, it can shift to match the challenge. If it's not a situation that can be handled, retreat. And survive long enough to make that determination.

EDIT: The reason why I hesitate to give a single answer for a combat form is that you specifically list humans as possible opponents. Humans learn. Whatever form you used last time will be countered next time. If I were facing a shapeshifter and had evidence that it was restricted to biology, I'd reach for the napalm and the liquid CO2. Extreme temperatures kinda trump everything biological.

** If I were a shapeshifter my emergency form would be designed for one primary goal: survivablility, with a secondary goal of information gathering.

If dividing into multiple bodies is possible my go-to form would be a swarm of locusts equipped with a paralytic agent. First move is to spread out, get enough bugs to safety to form a new body and then observe. Maybe even swarm and paralyze I think I can take them.

Assuming multiple bodies is impossible, I assume a innocuous form of something nearby. A Bush if outdoors. A piece of furniture if not. As a shapeshifter, my advantages are in striking suddenly and from anywhere. If my enemies would have the advantage, I stay hidden (a bunch of armed humans in the daytime? No thanks.) If I think my chances of winning are high, I take my prey down quietly and unexpectedly, silently shooting out a poison dart (from cone snail biology) to quietly take down my prey.

** Eyes. Lots of eyes.

With enough eyes, you can get sniper-like levels of accuracy. That lets you shoot poison spines, or stab with poisoned spikes, right in the gaps in anything's armor. Or just hit /their/ eyes, which are less disposable than yours.

A longbow has a range of several hundred feet, and doesn't require any non-biological materials, so duplicating that spring-strength for launching your spines should be easy. Add in a good neurotoxin on your spines, and you've got lethal long-range weapons against any living enemy with exposed eyes or skin. (Better yet, trap an area with poison slime in advance. But you were interested in "sudden combat" rather than "prepared combat".)

Spider-silk kevlar skin plates, to armor yourself with. Color-change skin like a cuttlefish, for camouflage.

Smoke pods. If you have to attack openly, you might as well make it impossible for anyone besides you to see. Smoke grenades aren't chemically much more complicated than poisons, so that should be doable. (Like octopus ink, but as shiny dust particles. Not efficient for actual land animals in natural environments, but makes sense for a melee inside a room. Use a selective-spectrum reflective particle so your eyes are fine.)

Give yourself some long eyestalks. See around corners when you're clearing a building. With luck you can slide a spine-tentacle around the corner and kill the enemies before they see you.

Octopoid upper body for grappling and dodging. Tiger legs for dash acceleration. A pair of wheeled "skateboard legs" for wheeled travel and rapid changes of direction. Use your skateboard legs to dash along walls: combat parkour.

Use skin camouflage and eyestalks to sneak up on opponents, or to see them coming and hide in ambush. Use poison spines or poison spikes to kill them in the gaps in their armor. Use tiger legs for dash and skateboard legs for direction changes and sustained speed.

But why settle for just poison, when you can also have impact? Pump yourself full of air. Spider silk will take plenty of pressure. Now, create some tubes. Load your tubes with your own spines, or any metal in the environment. What do you have now? A walking battery of air guns.

Air guns aren't as strong as explosive-cartridge rifles, but they're not wimpy. You can give yourself tubes with enough launching power to match a handgun or a light rifle. That won't get you through heavy armor - but it would easily get through the lighter armor over enemies' joints, sensors, and faceplates.

Facing multiple enemies with better guns than you? Dodge and leap, flickering your skin colors to make it look like you're going left when you're jumping right. Dash in among them, using your octopus-fold to launch yourself through small gaps. Now they have to worry about shooting each other, and you can shoot or spike all of them freely.

Against a tank, or other heavy armor? You're a hydraulic jack with a brain. Grapple close to dodge weapons, drive your spikes into any exposed sensors or joints, then dig in your tiger-legs and try to wrench the enemy's body out of its maximum range. Hard to use a tank if its barrel's bent. Most giants won't like their knees bent backward. Dragons probably can't handle their wings being twisted a full 360 degrees.

Keep an extra kevlar "cape-shield" of plates coiled up for extra defense. If you have to close on a single heavy-weapon enemy, charge with it held as a shield in front of you. If you suspect an incoming explosion, curl into the smallest ball you can and stuff yourself inside your kevlar cape. A compact ball gives the best armor-per-surface defense against an attack you can't dodge. But given the lethality of modern grenades, let alone bombs, your best bet is to kill the enemies faster than they expect so you can get away (or at least get burrowed under something heavy) before their friends with anti-tank rockets or napalm bombs show up. The best defense is a decisive offense.

Give your body a few heavily armored "cores" to hold basic brains and regeneration and a memory dump, so that you can recover from any bad combat. You can excrete and hide your core in the environment if you think you're losing the battle - bury it in the earth or rubble under your "corpse" or whatever. Lizard's tail stunt. Photosynthesis will let you restore yourself from sunlight, or certain fungal systems will let you restore yourself from dead plant matter underground, given long enough.

Gas pods. If your chemistry is good enough, you might be able to find a poison in your library that works inhaled, not just injected. In that case you could shoot dizzying or toxic gas into a room ahead of you.

The flexibility/protection tradeoff on your kevlar plates would depend on the engineering details. If your shapechange is magical enough, you might be able to have your limbs both armored and fully flexible. If not, you might have to have some more flexible limbs and some more survivable ones.

All this assumes you're clearing a building or lair in a hurry. If you've got time, stealth investigation followed by tailored ambush is always the better answer.

(Why skateboard legs instead of a whole-body wheel? A whole-body wheel would put a minimum size on how big a gap in combat you can slip through. If the room was crowded, you could be blocked. But if your biggest body part is just one leg, you can octopus-fold through small gaps between your enemy and the doorway/desk/window. The skateboard legs let you keep the sustained speeds and the rapid direction shifts of the wheel.

In the wilderness, the whole-body wheel would be more convenient for distance travel. But at that point you'd probably just give yourself wings.)

What would limit transforming into a large brain-in-a-vat creature, with bird-esque brain density, (so 5000x a human brain in sum) and quickly skipping to AGI? How does one resolve questions about where the self lives, given different creatures vary wildly; what if you turned into a creature that can be diced, with all the pieces surviving? What's the aim of ‘general combat' anyhow? Can one take an entirely unsustainable form that burns rapidly through energy reserves, and only recover them later by reverting to a more reasonable form? This should allow vastly faster and more powerful movement. What counts as ‘biology' and what's correspondingly plausible? Could you have thick armor made of the same material as limpet teeth, joined with equally tough flexible materials? Could you have what is otherwise the same material, but with fibers orders of magnitude longer with orders of magnitude fewer flaws? Could you make a mechanical contraption from this material, and run it off oils that are poured into it? Can one harvest such material, transform back, quickly recover, and repeat until one has a stockpile of perfectly crafted, extremely strong parts with submicrometer precision? Could you make seeds with custom DNA and rapidly cover huge areas with beings of your devising?

And since I can't math, I can only go for /more/ crazy.

Plan 1: Shapeshift -> Bird with giant thin transparent film dangling behind you. (Not sure how transparent your shapeshifting lets you become.) Then fly high and bend that film, effectively creating a massive microscope for setting things on the ground on fire without losing any of your mass. Would that have any chance in hell of working?

Plan 2: Shapeshift -> Earthworm with lots of methane production (like cows). Store up lots of methane and air, release them underground far away from your main body and explode it. You sacrifice some mass for a large explosion that should hopefully do more damage than just regular digging.

Plan 3: Actually now that I think of explosions, it's probably easier to just shapeshift -> tons of flowers spraying pollen everywhere and then cause a pollen dust explosion. The problem is, how would you survive that? So I guess, shapeshift -> earthworm with tons of flowers -> fill the air with pollen -> dig underground to hide from explosion -> explode pollen.

Explosions are also incredibly inefficient uses of energy, and biology is somewhat limited there.

Generally speaking, the best bang for your buck is almost always accelerating a small, hard projectile as fast as possible, so if you're to go the explosion route I'd suggest using it to create shrapnel, though even that's of limited danger unless you can think of a proper high-velocity explosive.

Also I think offensive and defensive forms would be /really/ different in practice, and the best defense is not fighting at all but hiding and fleeing, so in practice we're talking offensive forms. In that case it's really important to be able to pursue fleeing enemies, take down buildings, etc.

On the other hand, if the main use case is "I'm cornered and in a cave", the bladed octo-armed orb might be your best shot.

Depending on what "reasonable" means, it also makes a big difference as to 1) whether you are allowed to wield tools. Even a spear would make a huge difference. 2) how much brain you are allowed to have. (Because a lot will depend on how well you can coordinate those arms.

1) Siege capability - We want to be able to act as some combination of battering ram (nearby targets, destroying walls to chase enemy) and trebuchet/ballista (for distance, flying dragons, anti-aircraft), and harpoon (for killing very large animals)

2) Ballistics - As good as a crossbow, or at least sling. Harpooning ability would also be good, if we're expecting to fight dragons, sea monsters, or the like.

3) Hand-to-hand - We must kill any quick and agile foe that comes too near before it can harm us.

4) Grappling and crushing - We want to be able to grab and irresistibly crunch down on any heavily armored foe. (can possibly re-purpose the muscles involved in the battering ram)

5) Fast and agile - it's important to be able to chase down fleeing foes that can't be hit by ranged weapons.

6) Armored - not being easily wounded would be good.

7) Energetic - You need to get oxygen extremely efficiently, and store lots of fuel to power all this movement.

8) anti-fragile, decentralized, redundant, modular - You don't want there to be anywhere you can be hit that actually kills you. Ideally if you get cut in two, not only do you not due, but both halves continue fighting. (But if this possible it introduces a lot of other options)

9) amphibious / flying - you want to be able to function in as many terrains as possible. If you can't fly, it helps to be able to jump very high. . You might be able to double any long-spear-like parts with vaulting or stilt walking, which would be good (and would also up your speed).

What might this body look like? well, to start...If we could get really /strong and dexterous/ octopus arms, then we could probably just do that and add a few extra gigantic muscles to the central body to handle siege and crushing.

However, I'm not entirely sure that prehensile limbs don't have some sort of engineering limitations that prevent us from creating a creature of cartwheeling bladed tentacles. In nature we have snakes, octopus limbs, prehensile tails, etc. Snakes are very fast and strong, while prehensile tails are sort of load bearing. A tail of a kangaroo can support it's own weight. A dinosaur's tail can be used as a weapon but it's not very dexterous. Can all these properties be combined into a single limb? I suspect they might already have been, in nature, if that was possible - there's certainly enough limbs to go about evolving it from.

What I'm saying is, we might ultimately want real legs of some sort specialized for running, though that doesn't mean there shouldn't be /at least/ one long, bladed or harpoon tipped sort of thing which can do snake-like strikes on anything that gets close, and that might involve a tentacle or two.

To be fair, you really didn't make that clear. In most cases, unless you have a really good reason not to do so, a shapeshifter is going to want to run from an unknown threat the first time they face it, so that they can assess it and come back with a more tailored form. And, shapeshifter or not, you'd certainly never want to attack something/someone on their own turf without reconnoitering first.

** The optimum form would be "Athletic Human", assuming that the one couldn't improve one's intelligence with alterations to the brain.

The reason I say this is because of Humanity's weaknesses in combat/survival, not in spite of them.

Think about it, in our current (RL) world *we* are */the/* /Apex Predators/, because we've learned to build tools to compensate for almost all our weaknesses, tools which work best when used by something shaped anthropomorphically.

On top of that, we're actually disturbingly resilient, anything which doesn't kill us straight away has a fairly good chance of not managing it all, & if it does manage to kill us later, it's usually by weakening us to the things we're already weakest against (disease/infection, & toxins/poison).

**** Well obviously I hadn't considered the various Trans- & Post-Human forms others suggested, but assuming they weren't viable options my proposal remains largely the same.

You'd still go for an athletic (for muscle mass, reflexes, general fitness, & general health, thus offsetting many of the basic weaknesses) human form, but with some effort made to improve intellectual capabilities (insofar as you understand the physical mechanics of them) such as speed of thought, general creativity, intuition, mathematical talent, & logical thought.

By making yourself "smarter" (though the "speed of thought" element is arguably even more important, since it allows you to simulate greater capabilities in other areas just by having, effectively, "more time to think") you enable yourself to make better use of the other assets available to you, to identify & address (or use) weaknesses (address your own, use your opponent's).

The next biggest advantage would be any improvements you could manage to "creativity", since it doesn't matter how much you think if you only think the same things (or within the same contraints [aka "box"]), but this is also where "logic" & "intuition" come into play, "logic" would be the primary tool for ensuring that your creative ideas were plausible or at least practical, whilst "intuition" is an adjunct to "speed of thought" *and* "creativity" in that it allows you to make connections & reach conclusions your logical mind wouldn't have sufficient information for (every "intuitive leap" is a period of thought you've skipped).

Now I'm not going to say that Intelligence always wins, but to paraphrase Karl Schroeder in /Permanence/, Mankind evolved for greater Intelligence because we weren't sufficiently capable of surviving with any of the other tools biology had given us (e.g. Lions aren't smarter than us [yet] because they were strong enough & fast enough that their species was able to reproduce faster than it died off, & thus didn't need to develop the smarts to use their strengths better).

****** Because I didn't read closely enough to see that tools weren't available (in fact what I did read [Oxygen Tanks, etcetera] implied they were).

Also, if you can adopt a form that has biologically produced weapons & armor, there is really no reason those weapons & armor can't be formed to take advantage of technological know-how.

E.G.: Electric Eel cells could be used to power a railgun/coilgun (sorry, I can't remember the generic name, 'cos I'm pretty sure "Gauss" is just for coil based weapons, & "Tesla" while evocative is also just plain wrong), whilst the metallic components could be produced by cells/organs crafted for the job.

Alternately, smokeless gunpowders (or even black powder) are all largely organic in nature to start with, & a dense bone structure could be used to form both the barrel(s) & the projectiles.

Further down the list are muscle-powered weapons (bow, crossbows, atlatls, etc...) all of which could also be constructed of bone (not to mention that *wood* is also completely organic, & wouldn't even require cells/organs to convert surrounding materials).

Now, I will admit that shapeshifting into a form that could produce nuclear or even plain radiological weapons would be difficult (at least if you were limited to what could be achieved by an organic form, since the materials you would need tend to be highly toxic even aside from their radioactivity), but there are still many, many, options I'm not smart enough to have thought of (not being super-intelligent myself).

Honestly I believe that the smarter you are, the further away from your vulnerabilities you would want to keep any conflict you were involved with.

N.B.: Other reasons to adopt a human form are camouflage & deception, as a humanoid you can more readily hide amongst humans, & if your foe thinks you're a human they will attack with methods they expect to work against a human.

*** No, I don't see this working. Humans may currently be the optimum but that's:

- as a function of their social structure, not in 1 vs 1 combat, though we DO have some strengths there too, and

- as a function of evolutionary constraints, which only allow continuous mutations from previous forms.

We still have jelly-like eyes because these evolved from fish, for example. They're not the ideal form for cameras to use in air. But we couldn't go from "water eyes" to "air eyes" without going through some stage with eyes that are non-functional or significantly worse, and that closed that road, because any such mutations would be immediately curbed. A shapeshifter does not have those limitations. It does not have the limitations imposed by the need to /grow/ into its final shape either - everything you are has to be possible to make from a single blastula reproducing and growing, the shapeshifter doesn't have that problem. There's a bunch of constraints the shapeshifter can just handwave away, producing forms that make zero evolutionary sense but are ideal as bioweapons.

** This reminds me a lot of a certain character in Ward. Without any big spoilers, his power is very similar to what the OP described where he can change into a form before a fight but not during.

The situation OP described, however, pretty much never happens since you almost always have at least some idea of what you're facing down. If you're ambushing someone, you might want something that can act fast and get the job done quickly like a pouncing animal. If you're looking out for an attack, you might want to have something with enhanced senses that can either hold its ground or retreat easily. If you anticipate several enemies, you might want a form that can rain down biological artillery. If you have allies, you might want to adopt a form that can facilitate quick transportation.

I'd wager that a scenario where you literally have zero knowledge of your circumstances and whoever you'll be facing down warrants a form that can get the hell out of there asap. Maybe something like a cheetah that can glide or an insect size flyer so you can gather information and then run to a safer spot to change to a more appropriate form.

** It depends on what features you want to focus on.

Let's start with a winged cat. Flight/gliding is superior to rolling. Not much rolls in nature for a reason.

Maybe some kangaroo like aspects to the hind legs. Powerful leap and efficiency over long distances. Not full kangaroo shaped, but the internal components for sure. The large elastic tendons are powerful and they may as well be bouncing on springs.

Claws of course, and since we have not gone with hands for tool use or versatility we need some flexibility with the body for closer combat.

I'm thinking snake like. No flexibility restrictions, can contort and dodge in unpredictable ways and weave past the guard of a human opponent.

This is sounding too much like a dragon... wings, claws, long flexible body... this is very close to being a dragon. Fuck it, make it spit acid.

Skin next, cover it in Echidna like spines. or octopus skin for the incredible camouflage ability that can instantly mimic colour and texture. Octopus skin won't protect from damage but who cares, we can have layers. Add something a bit more defensible underneath that layer of skin.

Secrete a strong poison or paralytic like some frogs do all over their skin. Add in some electric eel components.

There are frogs that have a type of mucus that allows them to fully recover from practically being dissected.

You're a shapeshifter. Take the worst things nature has to offer and put them in one package.

If you have enough sharp parts make sure to club the end of your tail for extra versatility. Some times a mace is better suited than a sword.

Then poison the fuck out of all your weapons because there is no Geneva convention if you're a shapeshifter.

** Okay, so presumably a better option should be able to eat your octopus wheel alive. Ideally, it should be a no-contest type of scenario, while also being far more effective against each of the threats you listed.

Let's start with flying. An airborne assailant with hummingbird-like wings is immediately immune to any melee attacks by your critter or by a giant. It'll use /a lot/ of energy to fly, but that's fine, combat shouldn't last longer than a few minutes anyway. The real challenges would be heat dissipation and cardiopulmonary capacity. For heat dissipation, it could use large, featherless, highly vascular wings. For cardiopulmonary capacity, it could use a modified avian respiratory tract with a blow-through system, so air gets pulled in at the front and goes out through a back exhaust point shaped somewhat like a de Laval nozzle. With a sphincter at the exhaust point, we could constrict the outflow and get higher pressures within the respiratory tract for improved gas exchange, but releasing the sphincter would also be an easy way to shoot out a decent volume of high-pressure air to get a quick burst of speed. For the heart, we could use a paired-heart configuration which beats alternately to maintain continuous (almost non-pulsatile) flow. It would also be reasonable to also have elevated levels of 2,3-BPG to improve usage of the supplied oxygen.

To keep mass low, it would be better to ignore hips, legs and a digestive tract. A head and torso will obviously still be needed, and arms and hands are probably good to keep as well.

One advantage of keeping arms and hands is that if you're carrying a decent weapon like a gun or magical sword, you don't need to drop it. Further, with a gun, your octopus and the giant are both screwed, while the SWAT team and dragon would have their work cut out for them. Hands would also be useful for simple tasks that your octopus would struggle to do, like turn a doorknob. They could also be used for simply picking up rocks and dropping them on targets from high altitude.

For attacks, the best option is probably poison. You could conceivably form about a dozen sacs on your arms, similar to the fruits of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hura_crepitans][dynamite tree]], except high pressure hardened sacs that will burst on impact and fling about two dozen small 4 mL spiked high-pressure capsules outward at speeds of up to 160 mph out to ranges of up to 150 ft. The capsules create a secondary detonation on impact, releasing a spray of aerosolized botulinum toxin. Yank a sac off of your arm, throw it at the target, and then jet away. That should handle giants, SWAT teams, and octopus wheels with terrifying effectiveness. Against dragons, you'd have to just wait until they open their mouth and then fling it in and hope you can dart out of the way fast enough. You'd at least have better odds than the poor octopus wheel.

** I would go for a form that is close or has partially developed features of other forms to allow for faster transformations between a few different forms. From here, I would probably start with the tankiest form which can quickly be shed for progressively more mobile and less offensive form. For the tank form, I think I'd go for something with as many limbs that can be used concurrently as possible, and dedicate those limbs to projectiles. If the enemy gets close I'd shed that layer, maybe using the remains of its biomass for some sort of bombardier-beetle-like explosion. The next form would probably just be something highly mobile, like an armored jumping spider with webbing between its legs for gliding, throw some poisoned, launchable quills on there too. Depending on how the fights looking at this point, I'd either finish off the enemy or retreat.

​

I'd also experiment with making sub-intelligences, those either being literal clones in other forms, or weapons with enough neurons to do things. Assuming the latter since the former requires more biomass than I think is allowed for this challenge, on the simplest end I was thinking smart-arrows with eyes and the ability to shift the orientation of it's "tail feathers" or wings to create a homing effect. If these little smart weapons can use the shapeshifter ability as well, projectile quills that suck the victim's blood to use as biomass for growth into their body.

** Inspired by [[/u/veedrac][u/veedrac]] my default form would be a worldspanning underground fungus network. I would create vira which would be dormant until I activated it (pheromonea or radiosignal or whatnot) and when activated would cause someone to pass out for some time. By having the vira be asymptotic I would easily be able to spread it to the entire world without ressistance.

I would somehow navigate myself into being in charge of waste removal such that I have the biomass I need. I would create bodies that were remotely controlled for doing stuff above ground. And I don't think that either of those are outside the bounds of known physics and possible biology.

Sidegoals include making organisms to gather plastic in oceans, extracting gasses from the atmosphere, as well as generating money to fond all scientific research projects.

Now for your situation I would probably need to have a default all purpose form. Here's a few things that would definitely be in that form.

1.  A set of redundant organs. It's a huge vulnerability that if you die if someone gets a good shot into your face or your heart. I think that three redundant vital organs would take up too much space so let's go with two of all short term vital organs.
2.  Have non-human senses. Snakes can see infrared. Dogs can smell gunpowder. Bats have echolocation. Hearing is debatable since gunfire is really loud and might be overwhelming. Have eyes that faces in all directions. All of those takes relatively little mass and there's no good reason for you to include those.
3.  Make sure that even a touch on your opponent will incapacitate them. Have nails on your appendages that can deliver poison.
4.  Muscles would be made out of an [[https://phys.org/news/2018-04-strong-carbon-fiber-artificial-muscles.html][artificial and very strong carbon structure]].
5.  The default unit would have scales similar to a pangolin however the scales would be made by another artificial carbon alloy which I have misplaced somewhere.
6.  I imagine that most relevant fighting would happen inside cities and for that reason the default unit would prioritize speed and melee combat over ranged options.
7.  It's difficult to know what combat forms are the most effective since we can't really test it. However I imagine that something that have multiple strong tentacles that 1) can excrete poison 2) are strong/hard enough to penetrate regular building 3) have manually controlled hooks such they can be used to climb and throw people. Effortlessly crawling on buildings and x18 strong muscles for jumping is basically flight for most practical purposes.
8.  Skunks can spray chemicals into the air. Change that into some kind of black visible dust that blocked vision and the extra senses really pay off. Other chemical mixes might knock unconcious. Sure, the latter can be easily countered by having an external air supply but at that point you are putting more effort onto your enemies for relatively little cost.
9.  A few kinds of animals create there own light. You can basically replicate a flashbang if you roar loud enough and create a bright enough light.
10. Cheetah can run up to 61 miles/hour and by having that form as a base you could basically outrun cars in streets using tentacles to navigate corners.
11. You want a symbiotic lifeform inside of you that fixes wounds and restores organs. Or just a strong boost to whatever the body is already doing. Ideally severed appendages can be picked up and reattached to preserve biomass.
12. They would have to appear non-threatning or at least non-gross in order to maintain public relationships. If you're a giant omnipotent underground fungus you really want to be able to negotiate with people and having nightmarish creatures running around makes that really difficult. Default personality unless controlled would probably be close to that of [[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/truth-about-dogs/][some social parasite]].

#+begin_quote
  This is a liberal interpretation of the prompt. It doesn't say that you get to grow like this. It's not obvious why you'd even succeed to outcompete other fungi like this. Even if you did, why would you expect the result to be a useful system with centralized agreement? Neurons are slow, and using the fungal equivalent would be even slower. Nature might not be a particularly smart optimizer, but it's persistent; you're not going to solve these problems without properly addressing them.
#+end_quote

My addressing of the prompt itself is in the talk about the unit. I felt that other posts hadn't addressed what you would actually do as a shapeshifter. In terms of practicality you have to be a piss poor shapechanger if you can't think of a way to get rid of fungi. You can literally change part of yourself into fungi eating bacteria. It's useful because it's decentralized. Assuming we can get around the brain as fungi problem you have massive ammount of brainpower. Solutions for specific problems can be allocated to specific clusters.

  It feels that you are confusing biology and evolution. All of the proposals in this post have been using 'agentful' mixing and matching.
#+end_quote

‘Mix n' match' isn't biology, it's shapeshifter magic. I'm fine with your combinations being unbiological, they just need to be constituted from biological parts.

#+begin_quote
  I'm failing to see the problem. The idea is to have multiple tentacles that can do quick jerky movements and are strong enough to pull.
#+end_quote

The problem is that it's suboptimal. A jointed, bony structure is going to be many times more powerful, and correspondingly faster.

You're skipping steps again. Fungi eating bacteria already exist, but fungi aren't all dead. Though, again, you're assuming liberal things about the prompt that are better left as hypotheses. There's a reason my own response to this prompt was an amalgam of questions.

** Sergeant Schlock (from Schlock Mercenary) already solved this. Remain amorphous and fluid, be entirely composed of non-flammable, heat-resistant and chemically inert nanocarbon-fiber reinforced « muscle » that doubles as your whole-body-distributed brain.

Projectiles and blades are pretty much useless, blasts need to be large merely to incapacitate him for a short time. He can change shape according to circumstances (i.e. turning into a glider, an octopus, a fish or a spherical shapes). He can resist and counter any toxin or acid or base as well as secrete his own impressive array of chemicals, and envelops enemies to digest them directly (when he does not first vaporize them to ash with heavy plasma weaponry). He can grow as many limbs as he needs to hold his many weapons, which he carries inside his body-mass. He even has spare eyes now to mitigate the loss of a few.

** Okay, I've given my serious answer; let's start cheating.

​

I shapeshift into the body of the President of the United States and provide proof (fabricated, if necessary: I'm a shapeshifter, after all) that the US is being invaded by a hostile force. Now, whatever is coming after me has to deal with the entire military force of NATO.

** Green goo. Explode into microscopic spores designed to be incredibly durable and attach to / float everywhere. The spores in turn grow into copies of you, given sufficient local resources.

Drown the planet. Whatever you were trying to fight in the first place is either dead or expending significant resources holding out against you with no supply lines or backup, and you now have an intelligent shapeshifting biomass the size of continents, wriggled into every crevice of the planet and able to survive a total surface nuking.

*** I think you still need a brain to store memories. You could mass produce offspring like this, but they wouldn't have your memories even if they manage to grow their own brains. The new species of shapeshifters would probably destroy all other life on Earth, but they wouldn't be you and could all too easily decide that you're the next target to destroy.

** You're thinking way too small with that wheel idea. The limits of possible biology are not especially low. Biologically produced binary weapons (both explosive and chemical) open up the possibility of suicide drones and biological firearms. The latter could also be a possible vector for use of toxins; if facing something for which a bullet would wound but not itself kill, which is also protected from gaseous poison, toxins could easily finish the job as long as they're not completely bulletproof (in which case, say hello to insects loaded with binary explosives). And you can get a lot of mileage out of your biomass with materials that are extremely hard for their weight; nature already has a lot of these like spider silk, but your perfect shapeshifting should allow for engineering of novel, intelligently designed proteins to make even better materials.

Like others have said, the best strategy is definitely a differentiated swarm. The question from there is "how small do you go"? This doesn't need to be a single answer; you can use some of your mass for larger units and some for smaller ones. And thus my current answer is to have a spectrum of sized for easily working with things on a variety of scales. The means by which your shapeshifting works becomes really important when it comes to the specifics; do you need to have something doing your computation in order to keep existing, or do you think using something separate from whatever physical form you take? EITHER answer opens up a rather large world of munchkinry; if it's the latter you can have drones working on far smaller scales than would normally be possible while allowing for fine, conscious control. Possibly "molecular tweezers" level, allowing you to basically do whatever nanotechnology shit you want. But if the former is true you're even MORE broken; in the case just mentioned you're still limited to whatever level of computational capacity you started with, but if you're thinking using normal matter but have the innate ability to make functional changes to your biology without wrecking everything and dying, you're about to PERSONALLY experience the intelligence explosion... meaning it's pointless to speculate on exactly what you'd do, but if your goal really is to be as capable at killing things as possible, I certainly wouldn't want to go up against you.

It's also worth noting that even though you say it's too slow to use in combat, it'd have to be pretty damn slow to have NO combat use. You could design your form to have natural (by which I mean physically working, not dependent on continued use of your power) mechanisms by which small changes made with your power can domino out.

** I actually tried tackling a similar problem in my story recently ("The Optimised Wish Project", mild spoilers ahead), and I came up with similar ideas. Mind you that in that case there were the additional limits of cognitive abilities (the user needed to be able to visualise to some degree of precision the form they were turning into) and total power output (the user could not turn into a form /physically stronger/ than his base). My solution involved different forms, but mostly stuff with tentacles, nanometre-sharp blades, and the deadliest assortment of neurotoxins that biological cells could synthesise.
