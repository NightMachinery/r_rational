/Mentally, physically, and ideologically exhausted, Mega Girl drags her only worldly belongings through the rain-soaked streets to the house-slash-techno-fortress of Lisa Bradley, genius inventor and independent study advisor of one Alison Green, Mega Girl's alter-ego and rescuer of underwear libertarians. She comes to her with a question.../

“Well,” said Lisa on her prop of cushions, “first of all, being super strong is a really great way to change the world.”

Alison shifted on the couch. She and Lisa were having Girl Therapy Time, which as we all know involves fuzzy soft blankets, blaring screens, and half-empty bags of junk food and pints of ice cream scattered around, a /mise en scene/ of unsanitary coziness. “I can't exactly punch out structural racism.”

Lisa barely glanced up from her tablet; Alison had noticed that Lisa didn't seem to need to stop reading to carry on a lucid conversation. “No, but...you can punch out structural /punching/. I mean, unless you have super speed and no personal life, you obviously can't run around the world arresting every street criminal. But you can stop /war/. The movement of tanks and troops across borders is pretty slow and pretty obvious. You may not be able to intercept missiles and planes and things, but the fact is, you can walk right over to where the enemy is waiting and wreck their stuff. Maybe war would adapt around you, no land armies, just missiles and indirect stuff, but the /incentive/ for war is gone. If no one can stop you from doing the Kool-Aid Man into their headquarters and punching the heads off of the leaders, then there's really no sense in which anyone can do any /conquering/.”

“Awesome, so now I'm just accelerating the trend toward drone and cyber-based warfare.”

“Lots of people are being ruled by dictators right now, and you could just go in and punch the dictators into paste, and everyone would know you would do that so no one would want to be a dictator anymore, and while that wouldn't solve all the world's problems, it would be a /big improvement./”

“What happens to the status quo when I die? If my anomaly actually lets that happen, which we still don't know.”

Now Lisa did glance away from her screen, craning her neck back to see Alison. “Then we'd have had forty or fifty years of peace to build and grow and learn. Perhaps more importantly, we'd have had multiple generations of the development of a social hierarchy based in part on the impossibility of war. You wouldn't be able to elect tough talkers. They wouldn't have anything to talk about.”

“Then...why don't I want to do that?”

Lisa sighed and lowered her glasses to rub the bridge of her nose. “Probably because, despite what some people may have told you, you are totally, utterly, one hundred percent human, Miss Green. You are a grade-A, shining example of /Homo Sapiens/. And one of the realities of our species is that we can't Kool-Aid Man through a military fortress. We can't catch nukes with their bare hands or topple giant robots with a punch.” She looked down at her lap. “We can't, for that matter, save the world with robots. Not alone.”

Alison hesitated. “What can people do alone?”

“You know, I actually gave that a lot of thought when I was a kid. What would Clark Kent do if he didn't have superpowers?”

“Journalism? Farming?” /I can't believe I spent years fighting alongside Hector, the world's smallest comic book nerd, and I'm not even sure what Superman's day job is./

“No, like...Clark Kent /as/ Clark Kent. Clark Kent is a comic book hero---so consider Clark Kent the comic book hero, but no superpowers. Obviously, he wouldn't be able to defeat Darkseid or Doomsday or Death Death Bad Guy---”

“What?”

“Alison, I'm not going to lie, comic books are incredibly stupid. But my point is, what if Clark Kent was a real person fighting real battles? Battles that didn't involve interdimensional planet-eating demon monstrosities.”

“/What?/”

“Alison, comics are /incredibly/ stupid. But imagine Clark Kent. Would he still want to save the world? I think so. His sense of morals come from his humble, honest parents. They raised him to be a superhero. His /powers/ didn't raise him up, his parents did. His powers just gave him access to morality-achieving strategies like lifting cars above his head and flying around the Earth to make time go backwards.”

“Comics /are/ stupid.”

“That was in a movie. It's funny, though, his farmer parents. It's very middle America, don't you think? Farmers are the backbone of this country and the center of morality and decency. That image is a little harder to maintain today with the giant agro-corporations, their big, shiny machines, and the migrant laborers picking fruit for peanuts that they were told are nickels. What if we wanted to update the image of Clark Kent's parents to something modern? Maybe the mom could be an elementary school teacher and the dad a social worker. Jobs that take an education but not /too much/ education, jobs where being a force for good is very much determined by your own determination to be a force for good. These would be people who are wise enough to always be kind and kind enough to always be wise. They'd raise their children in a home full of books, but without any elitist distance from the content of the books. They'd have a dog. They'd use the word 'kiddo' a lot. Those parents would raise Clark Kent to be a hero, super or otherwise. They'd raise him to be the kind of hero we need today: Less showboating in a bright costume, more nuanced, dedicated thinking to solve complex and intractable social problems.”

“You've put a lot of thought into this.”

“I put a lot of thought into /everything/, Alison, it's literally my superpower.”

“So...we have a modern Clark Kent for a modern world.”

“A nice guy who knows you can't solve every problem by shooting lasers out of your eyes. Heck, let's make him female as long as we're updating everything else.”

“How would /she/ change the world?”

Lisa smiled sadly. “Aw, honey, she wouldn't.”

“What do you mean?”

Lisa spread out her arms. “Alison, being super strong /is/ a great way to change the world. You know why? Because super strength doesn't exist. If there was an easy way to change the world, someone would have done it by now. Or rather, the world is /already/ changed by the superpowers we're all born with. The Greeks understood this: the fire from the gods that represents human intelligence is a /superpower/. Not only /can/ it change the world, it /has/ changed the world. We /can/ lift cars over our heads, it's called an /airplane/. We can shoot lasers /into/ people's eyes to fix their vision. And thanks to working from home, we can wear underwear on the outside of our pants and no one can say anything about it. No one built any of that alone.”

Alison chewed it over. “Are you saying I should invent something?”

“No---first of all, no one just decides to invent something. But like I said, /we already live in that world/. It's the world humans created.”

Alison hugged her knees to her chest. “And I'm not human.”

Lisa snapped her finger. Before Alison could react, a robot had plucked a loose hair off her shoulder and fed it into a machine. “DNA MATCH: ALISON GREENE, 100% MATCH. SPECIES: HUMAN, 99.9999% PERCENT MATCH, WALRUS: 00.0001% MATCH.”

“I'm part walrus?” Alison gasped.

“The machines think they're funny,” Lisa said with narrowed eyes. “Anyway, as you can see, Alison, despite what you and possibly several of your interlocutors may think, you are human. Or rather, if we accept the hypothesis offered by several philosophers that super powers exist in our world because our world is a fictional one created to tell a compelling story, then you are fully the /product of human beings/. Everything you are is something that comes from humanity. There is no level on which /any/ observable phenomenon pertaining to you is explained by anything other than ‘Because a human being chose it to be that way.'”

Alison chewed over the unfamiliar idea that she was a set of patterns within another person's mind encoded onto a webpage by 1s and 0s. “Then how do human beings change the world?”

“If the people writing us knew, they'd probably be busy changing the world instead of creating a tiny one of their own. But we can look to history---assuming our history is a real one and not one altered by the Writer for the sake of his sick personal amusement. When Isaac Newton created his three laws shortly before going off to fight the Jabberwocky, he changed the world more than almost anyone in history, and he did it alone. People who truly do change the world can do things alone. They don't have to do it alone and maybe they shouldn't, but sometimes they do. That's because we live in a universe that respects your desires insofar as you respect its rules. Mostly humans haven't known the rules, and we're still figuring them out. But the universe doesn't care if one low-status person on a remote desert figures out the rules or if a million people working in shining laboratories do. The rules are the rules either way.”

“How...how do I figure out the rules?”

“Do you know lots and lots of math?”

“No.”

“Do you wish to learn?”

“No.”

“Then the level of change you seek will probably not be available to you; the universe will not respect your desires enough. But I don't think that's your role to play---this whole ‘change the world' thing is more about an expression of a desire to break old patterns, to 'break the wheel,' as another Strong Female Protagonist put it. There's a subtler and more encompassing idea being expressed by what you say---but this isn't the time for that conversation.”

Alison's brain had been awake for about thirty hours and was running on sugar, caffeine, and self-loathing. “How about I become a professional Dungeons and Dragons player?”

“You can't become a---there's no such thing as a professional Dungeons and Dragons player.”

“Watch me.”

“As your independent study advisor, I'm not sure I can approve that project.”

“Then how about I start a women's shelter?”

“Sounds good to me. These capecakes are my new favorite, by the way.”

“INITIATING FAVORITE,” a robot announced. The TV screen lit up, showing a cartoon.

“Off, off, off!” Lisa screeched, her face bright red. Lights in two rooms and an air humidifier all switched off while the TV played the theme song for a show apparently called /The Ostrich Barn./

“What should we do?” said the cute Hispanic girl.

“We should be gay,” said the cute elf girl.

“What's gay?” the first girl asked.

“/This/ is gay.”

“...Whoa,” said Alison. Lisa finally snatched the remote and shut the TV off, breathing hard.

“So, um, cartoons are cool,” Alison said desperately. “...I'm definitely not a walrus, right?”

“That depends on the progress of my genetic experiments and on whether you say anything about what you just saw.”

“My lips are sealed. I'll start working on a name for the shelter.”

And they Girl Powered on till morning.

**** Worm seems like the worst crossover for SFP. yes, they both fall within the broad umbrella of 'realistic Cape story', but they go opposite directions with it. Worm realizes that in order for superheroes to make any kind of sense, the world has to be much, much more violent than it is. So you get nazis and conflict drives. SFP decides to investigate what happens to all these super powerful individuals when violence doesn't make sense but the world still has problems.

Allison loses everything interesting about her character if punching harder is what's needed to resolve the problems in the story.

Similarly, Worm loses most of what makes it interesting if someone is able to punch hard enough to solve its problems without moral compromise.

With this crossover, you can't tell a SFP story until all the problems from the Worm setting are resolved, and you can't tell a proper Worm story until Allison starts getting outclassed, which won't happen until at least Leviathan.

That's kind of weird, lots of people changed the world not by figuring out the fundamental rules of the universe, but by figuring out some rules about human behaviour (and exploiting them). In principle math is good for that, but in practice they used abstractions that we can't easily encode into math just yet.

I took a few philosophy courses, and this wouldn't be even close to the weirdest causal chain and hypothesis I've heard a philosopher propose, but how does anyone arrive at

"Super powers exist"\\
"Super powers create compelling stories"\\
∴ "We live in a fictional world"

as a reasonable argument? If "Creates compelling stories" is a reason to be in a fictional world, then:

"All kinds of fictional settings can be imagined by authors in our world"\\
"Authors use those fictional settings to write compelling stories"\\
∴ "We live in a meta-fictional world"

Now we just need to wait for Mega Girl to realize this and decide to take up writing inspirational rationalist super-duper-powered fanfiction as a means of changing the world at all possible levels above her fictional world.

Also, I couldn't help but imagine this as the face of Strong Female Protractor:

Leaving aside any parallels to existing US foreign policy, it's not like individual dictators are the source of all government problems.

General corruption, and a general absence of security and public goods that leads to a prevalence of protection rackets, gang violence and police brutality are /extremely/ common problems, that absolutely cannot be solved by targeted assassinations.

** If someone knew how to change the world, they wouldn't be doing it all by themselves because the world is big and they are small. Instead they'd be starting easily understood, easily scalable and easily replicatable social domino effects.

And writing an easy to read, entertaining narrative showing people how someone would go about building an instance of such a beneficial cultural-economic memetic virus that can spread through humans themselves, would be an excellent way of actually creating that cultural-economic memetic virus.

When a rationalist says: "ideas good enough to change the world can't spread memetically because they're too complex and nuanced for the average idiot to grasp" that says more about their own maps of other people's minds than the actual territory of those minds.

I am very confused by what this paragraph is supposed to mean. Taken together with the subsequent paragraph about living in a fictional world....none of that means that her superpowers don't exist. They still do within the confines/strictures of the world they inhabit. And it starts out by saying that "super strength would be a great way to change the world, but it can't because it doesn't exist, but also, if it could, it already would have because we can already do those things with technology", which, in addition to being contradictory, I just don't agree with. There is value and power in being able to combine abilities into a single package. To make a trivial example, a modern smartphone is /so much more useful/powerful/ than carrying around a separate phone, calculator, camera, audio recorder, compass, etc. etc. etc. /because it's all in a single package/.

And more broadly, I'm not sure I get what the overall message of this short story is. It's clearly meant to communicate /something/, I'm just not sure if it's supposed to be some kind of critique of SFP, or of superhero stories more broadly, or how to change the world, or what.

*** To explain that one paragraph, at least, it's saying something slightly different. Super strength is a great superpower for Alison, because she's one of very few people who have it. It's like you say - she's got a lot of power in a single package - but the part of that which can change the world is that other people don't have it. In a societal sense, it "doesn't exist": Alison surprised a lot of people by being born with a strength that seems like it's out of a fictional story.

Someone with a phone in Ancient Greece could completely change the world: they'd find ways to become spies with the camera capabilities nobody expected, or innovate engineering with precise calculations. Someone in the modern day can use a phone for a lot of things, but lots of people have phones, so it's hard to wake up one day and do something with it that's world changing.

The following part about human intelligence isn't contradictory to the first part: it explains why intelligence should be considered 'super', as a parallel to how strength would be hard to innovate with if everyone had it for thousands of years.

*** This "story" is kind of a hodgepodge---in the original draft, it more explicitly explored the idea that Alison-the-character is looking for ways to save the world without using super strength because super strength literally doesn't exist in our world, and Alison is meant to represent real people, not superheroes.

**** I think the story is not just about exploring how she could create a utopia, but how she could create a utopia ethically. The conflict is less about whether she /can/ use violence/coercion to change things--she absolutely can, it's emphasized that there isn't much anyone could do to stop her--and more about whether or not she /should./ It's not exploring the question of how real people could improve the world, so much as it's asking what moral limits and obligations a person should have if they had that much power to inflict violence. The meta-explanation you've given for her not punching dictators into paste is interesting, but I don't think the story requires it to make internal sense.
