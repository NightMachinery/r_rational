I just finished and really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2][Let me In 2]], a fanfic continuation of the fantastic Swedish vampire movie "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amqqT3tfCi4][Let the right one in]]", or more specifically the somewhat less impressive American remake "Let me in" (starring Chloë Grace Moretz as vampire girl). It is not necessary to watch the movie to understand the fanfic, which you can read here:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2]]

The movie is built upon the classic 'boy meets vampire girl' premise, but with a very original take to it and a really great execution. The fanfic adds rationalist elements to this, starting with a logical, cold-hearted detective chasing the main characters who have to adapt to survive. It also features:

- Explanations of the vampire's abilities, with explicit rules and limitations
- The MC asking obvious practical questions (why not just use blood transfusions? Etc)
- An interest in book learning: The MC tries to learn science to become more effective
- Reflection on past mistakes, personal biases, and the ethical consequences of actions
- Clear reasons and explanations for why characters make the decisions they do

Please note that there is some genre drift as the story incorporates an increasing amount of romance, which may not be everyone's cup of tea, but even that is handled in an almost explicitly rationalist way. There are also several points where the main characters make painfully stupid mistakes, but they are 12 years old at the start so it does make sense, and crucially the story treats them as mistakes and has the characters learn from them. Besides, the story has very good fundamentals, including writing skills, having an editor, powerful character moments and so on. It's a very good read.

In short, I really recommend this story! If you have read it, write a comment below and let us know if you would recommend it as well. :)

** [Rec] this format for recommendations. We have a pretty large number of links being posted here and even in the minority that have some sort of a description, it rarely includes any references to the point of this sub, how rational the fiction is.

I haven't read your linked fic but I'm upvoting this post regardless because even if I think the story is terrible after I read it, I'd like to encourage other people to explain why what they're linking is rational. IMO it might even make sense to just make it a rule...

** I enjoyed the original +short story+ novel by lindqvist. I might check this out.

He wrote his own sequel, also, but it was a much shorter story and from the perspective of someone else.

*** Wasn't the original story a novel, and then the sequel was a short story? I've only read the novel, but I enjoyed it.

** I've read a few chapters so far and it's quite enthralling! Much better-paced than the average vampire story too.

*** Alright, spoiler-free review time!

I think this is a good example of a story that isn't necessarily /good/ fiction, but is very definitely /rational/ fiction (though I'd say it's quite good too). The characters are very introspective, the protagonist is way smarter than his age, and everyone spends their time discussing the practicalities and consequences of their actions.

The story feels like an okay continuation of /Let me In/, that shows the guilt of people committing terrible actions for selfish reasons, and how they deal with it. The story analyzes their behavior in a way that's very analytical and detailed; it lays out the different courses of actions available to them, what happens if they take them, and the reasoning both rational and emotional that informs their choices.

Spoilers: I'm a little disappointed by the ending. It works as a tragic ending, I guess, but I really don't like the idea that Owen killing Abby was the right choice. They point out that as time goes on her chances to get a stable, murder-free life increase, so it's not like she was terminally ill and had to be euthanized. And if you think your friend secretly wants to die and is too afraid to vocalize it (modulo some magic personality alterations), the right thing to do is to get them committed to a hospital where they can get the help they need, not enable their suicidal tendencies, let alone /kill them by surprise/.

**** I agree it's definitely rational (to a surprising extent, given that the guy doesn't seem to know about us), but why do you say it's not necessarily good? I'd say the writing fundamentals are better than 80% of what's popular on this reddit. I mean, he has an actual editor, a clear understanding of the genre, and he planned the entire plot in advance. Yes, his use of dialogue tags is a bit novice, and he's not a big fan of descriptions (seriously, he never even described what Abby's wings look like. Are they bat wings? Feather wings? What?), but that's minor compared to the rest. Contrast this with stories like Purple Days, which is hugely popular even though it's unreadable garbage.

I totally agree about the part in spoilers: I got physically angry when that happened. At the same time, it was entirely believable that Abby would want that and that Owen would do it, hopeless romantic that he is. And I clearly *cared* about what happened to the characters, which is always a sign of strong writing. So yeah, I think this is a case of the author wanting to carry out his genre-established Tragedy Tropes(TM), when actually I think this would have been a great opportunity for a rationalist subversion. Have Owen go "screw the tropes, I have rationality!" and find a way to fix things. I'm actually somewhat tempted to write a (short) alternative ending to this story, just for the heck of it. <_<

***** Re: the ending, yeah, Owen would totally do that, but I'd expect Alvirez to know better given his previous experience with depressed people.

(I would also read that, probably)

Re: rationality, I'm not saying it's not good, I'm saying it tries to be rational before it tries to be engaging. It's hard to nail down why, and I wouldn't want the story to change radically, but it's definitely a vibe I had reading it.

****** (I would spoiler that first bit, just in case)

I get what you mean now. The rationality is too explicit, which is a common flaw of rational fiction. Instead of having a teacher character go "I will now lecture about X for 5 paragraphs", it's better to work the lessons into the story to make it less heavy-handed. I didn't mind it too much in this story though, but I'll admit I started skimming some of the psychology stuff near the end. The epilogue especially felt to me like the introspection and narrating distracted too much from the ending.

** Do you recommend watching the Swedish or American movie as preparation for this story? I know it's been mentioned that it isn't necessary, but I'd like to anyway.

*** The Swedish version is a bit more artsy, and frankly, better. So unless you're a really big fan of Chloë Grace Moretz or hate Swedish, I would watch that one. That said, the remake isn't bad, so if you're only watching it to get a better feel for the characters in the fanfic, go ahead and watch the American one.

​

Edit: Oh, uh, if you do watch the swedish version, bear in mind that one of the characters has a different gender in the remake. That might prove a bit confusing, otherwise. <_<
