** Speculation on the other magic mentioned:

Each magic seems to encourage a particular kind of philosophy. Denialism is Kantian virtue ethics, right down to the contrast of duty and inclination. Ritualism is pretty clearly utilitarianism, that's the whole point of the story. There's even a digression on how denialism can be understood as a subset of ritualism based on the presence of an ends - bodily power - just as the argument that virtue ethics can be understood as a subset of utilitarianism with the ends of living a righteous life (or something like that, I can't recall). Both influential ideas in the enlightenment, heading into the industrial revolution.

So what is Eloism? Competition among equals - is that a reflection of market forces, the Invisible Hand? And elementalism - is that an allegory for the romantic movement? Submitting your will to the sublimity of nature? I really don't have much backing this up, but I'm really curious whether the analogy continues in the rest of the world.

*** Both those are being saved for the sequel, and neither is fully fleshed out at this point, in part because I don't have even the bare bones to the sequel's plot fleshed out yet. I /think/ that I like competition vs. cooperation as a follow-up theme though.

(Eloism takes its name from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system][the Elo rating system]].)

** Dammit. I just started some new books, and my next chapter is due soon. Saw this and thought "I'll just read the prologue."

Now I'm hooked. Great writing, as usual. The two magic systems are intriguing. The characters too. I'll have to resist reading more until next month at least.

Minor typo at the end of the prologue: "is reasoning" should be "his reasoning."

*** As fair warning, this is /super/ rough. It was written Nov 2014, Nov 2015, and Nov-Dec 2016, at a pace of roughly 2,000 words per day throughout (edit: that math doesn't work out). There was never any beta reading, nor any editing beyond what I did in the course of rereading sections, so there are whole chapters there that have only had a single pass through my brain at high speed.

***** Spirits exist in three forms: living in the world in spirit form, existing as a magic item which can go beyond the domain of the spirit, and living in the spirit realm. Ulf comes out of the spirit realm and into the physical realm when Sofia is around 10 years old (IIRC, still haven't reread it), which makes him one of the first to appear. Sofia comes into her power more as she gets older (and spends more time with spirits), so they come to her more easily.

There's this little subplot where she's known to be a spirit caller at five years old and then that get repressed by Hirrush, but I don't think I actually ended up doing too much with that - it was meant as a false-start or false-awakening or something?

(Ulf is also solitary and taciturn as far as spirits go.)

*** How does it compare to his other work? For both Glimwarden and Limelight I started off intrigued but lost interest after about 5 chapters. I know the story can't be judged solely by the beginning, but I don't want to be disappointed by a plot that moves too slowly and characters who turn out to be boring.

**** It's pretty great, in my opinion. Less polished than Limelight, but much more engaging than Glimwarden. It does the rarest of things, and manages to communicate a thematic message about being smarter without being particularly preachy, as well. The arguments in favour of virtue ethics are a little straw-manny, but maybe the author will fix that up in subsequent drafts.

** Hmm. Are spirits an analogy for intuitions? Is the process of turning them into magical items an analogy for sublimation? Essentially... Sophia has control over the mind (world) because she respects the remnants of the old world (spirits) that it was built from. This mirrors the process of maturation a person undergoes as they understand the context and purpose of their instincts and learn to move with them instead of against them.

Super cool if true. Though I often question the value of veiled analogies... I'd bet we'd have more of an impact on people if we'd just come out and say things. Hard to judge though. The maturation process is slow and mysterious and most of us don't get to watch them unfold from start to finish, very often.

**** Jones in general I feel lacks the popularity she rightly deserves -- I only encountered her as a result of Ghibli's adaptation of Howl's Moving Castle, but after that quickly made my way through the rest of her works. I always liked her tendency to wrap things up nicely by the end of the book, where all the plot threads come together and characters re-meet (or are revealed). Similar to Gaiman's /Stardust/ in that way (who she was good friends with). The sequel to DLoD, /Year of the Griffin/, is a solid read, too! (the Moving Castle series probably being tied for the two Derkholm books, with the Chrestomanci series in second, and Dalemark/Magids third)
