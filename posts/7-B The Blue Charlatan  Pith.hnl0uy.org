** Ayyy. Great to see some rationalization from Ana's angle as to her actions. Very true to character for a person with a single achievable goal but several, often contradictory paths to achieve it. Interesting to see how well Ana's and Copycat's abilities interact, and to see how quickly countermeasures to her illusions can be dealt with.

Some confusion as to whether Wes is wallowing or scheming. My bet is on scheming.

Also excited to see how well r!Clementine will have reacted to someone who knew her house inside out(Ana) being a known enemy :) .

** Not sure how rare illusion vocations, or a vocation that could be confused as illusions, are but could this mean Ana won't ever be able to officially reveal her Vocation? Seems like that would kind of gimp her dream of being a Guardian.

It was nice to see Ana's viewpoint on the whole murdering-someone-and-taking-their-body thing (though not in that order), I'm not sure I agree with her choice, mostly because she seems to be essentially gambling with her life that a better option will work out, but I imagine not having official papers for the body you occupy would limit one's future options too.

*** This is a really good point. Barring some serious character deaths, i wouldn't expect Ana to be the good guy at any point in the story.

**** To be fair, the Guardians aren't exactly the "good guys" either. The Principality is an oppressive and highly xenophobic regime that enforces a rigidly caste based society, the Guardians are the chief means by which that regime exerts power and enforces their authority, and the culture of Paragon (which is where Guardians come from) actively encourages Guardians to be less like Kaplen and more like Lorne. I'd honestly like to say that the Greenhands are the closest thing we have to the "good guys," except that their organization and movement has been completely co-opted by a mysterious conspiracy with unclear goals but which regularly employs fairly horrific tactics, so... yeah, there's no real group I'd call the "good guys," everybody's just shitty and awful in different ways.

**** I mean, we're clearly less than a few months away from a violent revolution thoroughly wiping out the social order, so by then the only thing that will matter is whether she got her replacement body in time.

Yet in the same chapter Lorne mentions giving her a new body.

** So, let's decide how much of what Brin says is bullshit!

#+begin_quote
  “I'm here to warn you: Paragon has launched an investigation into you.”
#+end_quote

This warning is obviously legitimate, and I suspect everything he shares with her on this front (such as how much info they have on her) is true. He has reason to protect his investments.

#+begin_quote
  “You're not understanding,” he said. “The system is designed to protect against anyone being compromised, including me. If I try to shut down an investigation, that'll send up flags. I'll get blocks placed on me.”
#+end_quote

I also think this is true, or close enough to matter. In this sort of world, with these kinds of powers in play, you sort of /have/ to take the measures he's describing. I suspect he's downplaying his level of power and influence somewhat, but only to make the reality of the situation more palatable for Ana. I suspect the truth is that it's less "I can't do jack shit" and more "There are things I could do that might help, but it wouldn't help /much/ and it would cost me a great deal, so it's not happening."

#+begin_quote
  “I wasn't a bully. I did everything I could.” He raised his voice. “You don't know where I come from. You have no right to judge me.”
#+end_quote

I doubt Brin was needlessly malicious and cruel like Lorne, but I don't think he really cares about the fact that people like Lorne thrive under the current system beyond a vague "yeah, that's probably bad" kinda way. He's openly nostalgic for a time when the system was even more oppressive, unequal, and stratified than it is now and makes his disdain for progressive political elements clear whenever he mentions them. I suspect he's more critical of Lorne's motives than his actual actions.

#+begin_quote
  “You knew Wes was an Ebbridge, didn't you?”

  “Yes.”

  “And you still let him use me, put me at risk, throw me into the fire. Why?”

  “Because I thought you two would work together,” he said.

  “Because you want to use us.” After thinking about it, I was fairly certain he'd only threatened Jun to pressure him into joining us.

  He shook his head. “That's not it.”
#+end_quote

Nah, that's it. Like, I'm sure he sort of vaguely hopes all his mercernaries will thrive in his service and live vastly improved lives thanks to it, and he might even make some of his arrangements keeping an eye vaguely towards that, but he's chiefly concerned with how useful they'll be. He put Ana and Wes together because he thought they'd work well together and be useful to him, and while he might have had some ideas about how they might be good for each other on a personal level or something, that didn't drive his decision making.

#+begin_quote
  “I donate the vast majority of my paycheck,” said Brin. “You think I live in a mansion like an Epistocrat?”
#+end_quote

The only way I buy this is if he considers the payments he makes to his shady mercs "donations." I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he doesn't technically have money to spring for a new body for Ana, but that would be because the money is earmarked for other purposes (paying other mercs, bribes, emergency body replacements for irreplaceable and much more valuable assets, etc.), not because he doesn't actually have it.

I'll also buy the fact that he lives relatively austerely for someone of his status and income level, but I suspect "relatively" is doing a shitton of work in that sentence.

#+begin_quote
  “I don't want your sympathy,” he snapped. “What I meant to say is -- I've buried a lot of soldiers. But if I tried to bury you, I think you'd claw your way out of the grave, even if your coffin was buried a hundred feet deep. Even if it took a decade.” He looked into my eyes. “I push you because every time you break, you end up a little stronger.”
#+end_quote

I think he's genuinely impressed with Ana's progress and determination, but not to this extent. He thinks she's a remarkably stubborn kid, but if she died tomorrow his only surprise would come from the fact that it took so long. He's also just flat out lying about his "tough love" "I push you to make you stronger" shit. Sure, he wants her to get stronger, that's good for him and he probably even gets to feel like a good person for a little bit whenever she shows improvement, but he's really just wringing as much use out of her as he can.

I like the meetings with Brin, it's fun to try and figure out how sincere he is and just what game he's playing at.

I love that sentence =D

And yeah, I mostly agree with your analysis. Brin is /clearly/ stringing Ana along; she's doing an incredible amount of critical work for him and he's giving her the bare minimum of resources to continue.

Fucking /Lorne/ is promising her a body, and she's doing a lot less for him than she does for Brin.
