** Everything I've heard about this story sounds extremely appealing to me, but I just can't get past how poor the translation is. At this point, I'm basically hoping for a better translation or some high-quality fanfiction.

*** Yeah, I bounced hard off the first dozen or two dozen chapters. The translation alone wasn't the main issue - I've read and enjoyed through entirety of Release That Witch and that translation was /dire/ but the starting chapters are also extremely tedious.

But I might give this another chance, when I /really/ have nothing else to do.

****** It got a hefty normal novel's worth of final act. It's only 'abruptly' by weird Chinese webnovel standards.

** The review's author posted this review in a comment one of the Recommendation threads, but I feel reviews as good as this one should be posted in the sub itself and I hope more people write and post reviews like this out in the open, where everyone can read it.

** This is my favorite series right now, fun, mostly logical, and cool powers. The series does a pretty good job of following its own rules and is a blast to read.

*** *Spoilers below:*

#+begin_quote
  /Why bother with the veneer of investigation and research, when questions are answered automagically by divination, dreams, and asking magic mirrors?/
#+end_quote

In-universe excuse is things of a higher level or sequences naturally counters divination, dream analysis and magic mirror scrying. I think it was also noted quite a few times that scrying things you are not meant to know often result in death or worse (ala Lovecraft), although I agree that Klein isn't punished nearly as much as he deserves for his reckless curiosity and constant death-seeking. But those high-level events would have gone unnoticed by the MC's POV if he wasn't paranoid enough to double-confirm things in his magical "cheat" grey fog, which somewhat overcomes those restrictions. Otherwise, the readers over his shoulder would miss out key plot elements.

And narrative convenience is an actual plot element in this story, given the SCP-like artifact feather pen and the high-level player that possesses similar powers himself. It's like Worth the Candle characters talking about what their GM would do.

Personally, I think these writing tricks by the author is preferred over to rapidly switch between the villain-of-the-arc's POV and Klein's, while Klein is none-the-wiser. I dislike, as a reader, having certain vital information revealed to us for a long period of time while the MC is utterly clueless. It makes them feel incompetent through no fault of their own.

Also, the author does rely on in-universe rules set up a long time ago such as "pathway convergence principle" to bring opportunities to move the plot along, to attract rivals closer and make fights happen, to have narrative convenience. The rules are explained, the magic works consistently (except for a few later on), and actions by even side characters and villains make sense as if they were intelligent thinking beings, taking what they believe are the best choices for their current situation.

LotM is not rationalist fiction, but it is certainly is rational-adjacent.

*** I similarly enjoy both this and Gu Zhenren, mentally grouping them together! It's possible I have already asked you this in a different thread and forgotten, but is there a fiction that you feel is more enjoyable than (and particularly if rationalist-wise more so than) both?

*** u/Makin-:
#+begin_quote
  I am always wondering why his enemies aren't able to do the same stuff and apply the same reasoning against him or his minions.
#+end_quote

I think it's often stated his pathway (or whatever the gray fog is) is a natural counter to divination and Spectators, and the whistle is added on top of that, but it /is/ pretty convenient. That said, for Klein at least divinations fail all the time when he doesn't have /any/ hints, so he does need some research. I think the story is somewhat consistent at that requirement.

The anti-divination items remind me of how Worm self-insert fics pretty much always have to come with anti-Thinker powers otherwise it's an auto-loss. Divination is really powerful in Lord of Mysteries.

I think you're not giving the story enough credit, though. There is a degree of prep-time you rarely see in stories of this kind.

  /That said, for Klein at least divination fail all the time when he doesn't have any hints, so he does need some research./
#+end_quote

This reminds me of the key joke of Vol 2: Klein's fake detective persona claims to make deductions but is secretly relying on magical divination and then reasoning backwards. And then he calls himself Sherlock, while most people here have long observed is superhuman and does NOT engage in fair play whodunnit.

Up until he actually does some proper deductions so he can go back to divining.

***** If you're referring to Arrodes, it does make the story worse. I wasn't thinking about it when I wrote that reply. Regarding repetitive story beats then yeah that's a flaw, but hardly an irrational one. If there is an optimal solution to problems of course he's going to use it every time.
