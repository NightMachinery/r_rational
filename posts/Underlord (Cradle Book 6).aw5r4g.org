** So this book series has been recommended here before and now that the sixth book is out, I'm making a new recommendation for the Cradle Series.

It's very much a Western style of the Xianxia genre which seems to be surprisingly popular around here, even if very few books ever meet our [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/d0zm9va][standards]] for rationality. There is a lot of well-deserved criticism of how many main characters are very villainous, the enemies and female characters are usually under-developed, the economies of cultivation aren't logical, the conflict scales very poorly as you go from one city in the beginning to interstellar in scope at the end of a series, and awkward prose due to translating from a different culture to ours. But I bring up all of these flaws to say that the Cradle series completely avoids all of the typical flaws in Xianxia and has a very smart character who sets out to cultivate smartly instead of being bullheadedly stubborn.

The women are well-developed individuals with goals of their own (instead of being cheerleaders or trophies), the economics are logical, the conflicts actually use military doctrine modified for the power-levels involved, enemies aren't raving loons who must kill the main character no matter what, and the story is original in the English language so no awkward prose from translating!

*** Do you know of any other good Xianxia? Ever since I got into Cradle, I've tried others, but they kept being too shit for the reasons you mentioned.

My holy grail of a Xianxia is one with a clever and smart person, where the advancing comes from being clever instead of brute force elixirs/luck, who cares deeply about others and has empathy for most/all people. It would need to be a real story, with struggle and complicated characters, not falling into the trash heap you mentioned. Preferably female, because I like reading female protagonists, for whatever reason, but it doesn't really matter.

This is broadly covered by Cradle, though Cradle didn't go into how Madra worked as much as I liked, nor did it go into compassion very much. I get why -- it's hard to fit so much amazing stuff into one space, and Cradle /fits/ a lot of stuff.

That said, I can totally imagine an AU fanfic focused on Akura Mercy, or an AU based on Lindon who was more clever and driven in his childhood.

**** A series has recently started on RR called [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]], it's an adaptation of a quest story from another site, it is /very/ good so far. Especially considering that it has a female protagonist, something that is almost unheard of in Xianxia, and if it is the case usually means that the genre is heavily diluted by very bad romance, which does not appear to be the case here.

**** [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/way-of-choices][Way of Choices]] is without a doubt one of my favorite stories and I can never recommend it enough. It is a male main character though. I will admit that it takes a little bit to get used to the writing style but once you do, it is definitely the best xianxia I have read. The writing is just stylized, not bad. It doesn't have the middle school level of writing that so many web fictions have and is actually really well put together and written. The world building is insanely good and the power progression is SO satisfying.

The top of the line godly powered characters are brought up right away and the constant power limit they represent stays constant and keeps the story grounded instead of getting ridiculous in terms of power scale. Powerful characters exist the entire time and don't just conveniently start showing up once the MC and crew are strong enough to deal with them. There is just a lot of political maneuvering and careful balances of alliances and grudges that keep everything in balance to prevent people from killing each other.

The main character starts of weak and stays weak for a LONG time but it makes it so that once he does start getting strength, it feels extremely earned. A lot of these stories have the weal MC who then gets blessed with a godly item and then turn overpowered in 2 seconds and stay overpowered for the rest of the story. Not this one, in my opinion. Plus the main character is just a really good person and satisfying to read about.

Hopefully I convinced you to try to read it and I hope you end up enjoying it.

**** Forge of Destiny is a good one that I would second.

I only have a few others to recommend:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/white-collar-cultivator.44460/][White Collar Cultivator]] was pretty good with an everyman character isekaied into a generic wukia world and with him digging into the mental differences between mortals and cultivators. He's basically using common-sense and his mastery over bureaucracy to stay alive. Unfortunately, WCC is dead so you might not like the abrupt ending.

[[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Forty-Millenniums-of-Cultivation/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]] is also pretty good where they take the idea of usual Xianxia where mortals are worthless and should be discarded in pursuit of power and flips it on its head with the enlightenment ideal that everyone is worthy including the mortals. It's to the wuxia genre what HPMOR with its transhumanist ideals to Harry Potter. Here's a better written [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zncxn/forty_millenniums_of_cultivation_%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E5%9B%9B%E4%B8%87%E5%B9%B4_rt/][shill]] on it. Just warning you, it starts out as a very generic Xianxia story to set up tropes to subvert and hints of rationality only begins to appear around chapter #100 at the end of the first volume.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic][The Dao of Magic]] is a fantastic story about a man from Earth who seeks out to scientifically investigate Qi and wants to completely rebuild cultivation society into one where everyone isn't back-stabbing each other all the time.

**** I've been reading (and likely will continue to read) the SAM series, but it isn't nearly as good as Cradle. The protagonist is basically a passive particle to events going on around him. He doesn't do nearly as much investigation/work on using/improving his magic and as far as I can tell the plot would be nearly identical if he did nothing (basically the MC is just a glorified camera for the reader to view what's going on). It's worth a read because the world building is pretty well done and interesting and the writing isn't bad, but man does the activeness/relevance of the main character need a SERIOUS overhaul.

But, like I said, even given all that, I'm still reading it.

***** Mild spoilers ahead!

I got a similar impression as you did of Corin, but I feel like that's somewhat intentional on the author's part as set up for future character growth. He spent his formative years living with an abusive father, constantly being compared to an older brother who was better than him in every way, isolated from anyone close to his age, and is extremely introverted. Being passive is somewhat expected from his upbringing.

In the first book, he is manipulated by many people around him and he is constantly playing catch up to learn what everyone else knows. The second book, he is showing more initiative to find out more information, is more independent/less reliant on others, and is (a little) more social.

Considering that there is expected to be roughly 7 books in the series, I feel like Corin is meant to be passive in the beginning of the series and will become more proactive in future books as time goes on.

** For those not familiar with the series: it's basically [[https://i.imgur.com/yo0xght.jpg][Bleach]], with a pinch of sci-fi. Also, the author actually poured some effort in having the world make sense. The world building doesn't all hold up to the closest scrutiny, but there's a really satisfying story to be found if you can look past some of that.

Mild spoiler to give you an idea where we are in the story: in this book Ichigo unlocks his bankai, and in the next book he'll compete in the Chūnin exams. So, about halfway towards the point where these kinds of stories /should/ stop, even though they almost never do. I'm fairly confident about this one staying on the rails and not necessarily overstaying its welcome, though.

*** I think Will said that they planned Cradle to be 12 books, but it might end up being a bit longer. Also, just because Cradle will finish, doesn't mean that the story of Will's multiverse will.

Also, Cradle is like Bleach in that the main character of Cradle was designed to be half a typical shounen protagonist, half actual human being. Besides that, the quality of the world building and story in general is a /lot/ better than Bleach.

Sure, there's advancing your level of magical combat ability, but it's still really different. Unlike Bleach, where the plot was created to have as much cool sword fights as possible, Cradle's plot fits together /really/ well. There's a balance of training, fighting, interpersonal stuff, comedy, etc.. Basically, Cradle has a really good plot, while Bleach was mediocre.

Don't get me wrong, I do like Bleach, but comparing them is like comparing apples to oranges. I just hold them completely separate in my head.

Sorry, I'm just not a fan of your Bleach analogy. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Oh I definitely agree with this point, but there are a /lot/ of overlapping elements: a teenage boy getting rescued by a divine warrior who sets him on a journey to becoming powerful, a complete overhaul of the power structure once the protagonist leaves the starting area, a near-all-knowing mentor who keeps their students in the dark about his true power, powerful people pushing weaker fighters to their knees with the power of their spirit pressure, the significance of discrete power steps being emphasised only a few episodes before the protagonists beat those higher level foes in 1-on-1 combat, /"finally there are no witnesses, so I can unleash my true power"/, ... It's all there. And yet, as you mentioned, these books are a great read. The /ambiance/ of Bleach was stellar, and these books manage to capture that same spark, which I think is fantastic.

***** Okay, you're pushing a bit much on the Bleach connection. :D

I think a lot of that just comes from tropes in general, or from eastern warrior magic tropes. The push-down power, the discrete power steps, revealing true power, etc.. Lots of these elements overlap between Bleach and Cradle, and other fics.

This is kinda pushing it. In Bleach, there's nothing divine about Shinigami, they're just powerful spirits. Suriel is a whole other ball game. Also, with Ichigo, his powers were inside him the whole time, and probably would have started sooner or later without Rukia, where Lindon truly had nothing.

Don't get me wrong, they're both great (though I actually like Cradle a lot more), but thinking they're incredibly similar just means you haven't read/watched many other eastern style fics. For example, even Naruto has a broad similarity to Cradle in how the magic system works, though Xianxias take it to extreme power levels. It's that whole eastern magic style, vs western DnD/Harry Potter wizard type magic.

Again, Cradle exceeds Bleach. Bleach was one fight to the next, always trying to save /somebody/ (or stopping 2 different people from destroying the world). That was more or less the entire point of training in Bleach. Cradle, on the other hand, has completely different motivations. Lindon's not living and dying at the point of a sword in swordfights; he has to be more clever than that. Bleach had a very standard, simple plot, whereas Cradle has a more sophisticated, but not insane, plot.

The ambiance and feeling is similar in that there's eastern magic style fighting with crazy levels of escalating power, but Cradle is just /so/ much better. Despite Cradle's power levels going much farther than Bleach, Cradle's world building makes sense to me. It feels like it could be a consistent world/multiverse than can exist, but Bleach? Things don't add up enough in Bleach. At a minimum, what about all the other cultures, let alone talking about number of people in the Seretei, or how the magic feels artificial? (Bleach feels like a being said, this is how magic works, with different Shinigami magic types coming to people naturally in battle, whereas Cradle feels like the early humans in Cradle had to explore how the world actually worked, with trial and error.)

I like Bleach, I like fanfiction of Bleach. But Cradle is just so good, that it feels wrong to directly compare them, because they /are/ actually quite different.

Sorry if I ranted too much. I just wanted to put out counterpoints, because although they are similar in how you say, it's the same in that TVTropes pages of both should share a bunch of listed tropes, while still being quite starkly different. I just feel really passionately about Cradle, I guess. <3

I suppose that's true. I compare it to Bleach because it's the most similar story I know and that shit was amazing as a 13-year-old, but that was literally half a life ago and I read/watched hardly anything truly similar since. What stuck with me were the narrative devices and the ambiance, both of which pop up in Cradle as well.
