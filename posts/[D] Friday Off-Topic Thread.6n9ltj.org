Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Weekly update on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing][hopefully rational]] roguelike [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk][immersive sim]] Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

Work continues onward.  I've made fairly substantial progress with the organization of the XGEF framework, and I'm on the cusp of getting modded modules loaded and associated with their respective systems.  Exciting times.

I don't have any game mechanic discussions ready for today (but I'd be happy to answer questions if anyone has any), and I'm unlikely to get much work done on it this weekend, as today (or technically last night) marks the beginning of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbDSEpIZat8][GMTK Game Jam]] which I and a few of us from this subreddit are entering.  It begins Friday at 6PM local time (in my case central) and will run until 6PM local time on Sunday.  I don't know what the theme is yet (although by now it's been announced for those who are starting in earlier time zones), but we've got our setup primed and ready.  

If at all possible, I'm going to be steering the design of the game we make into a concept that makes sense to explore for Renegade, but it's quite possible that this won't be doable.  In that case this will simply be a fun diversion--but if it's not, it'll be a nice chance to try and flesh out some of the ideas that we've been arguing about for months now.

If you'd like to be part of the design discussion or help playtest once we get to that point, [[https://discord.gg/u4KgdE3][feel free to join us in the #gmtk-jam channel]] on the subreddit Discord server.  In particular if you're an artist looking to sacrifice your weekend to help make a 48-hour game look a little less pathetic, please let me know--we've got several programmers but no one to make pretty pictures. It won't be the end of the world if we don't have any dedicated artists, but it would be nice to have a game that isn't a /complete/ offense to everyone with eyes.

I'll be sure to post our result next week so you can all point and laugh, so be sure to work on some nice, derisive guffaws in the meantime.  I only accept the best of ridicule.

** For about 5 years now, I've been getting the majority of my news from daily email newsletters like [[https://www.dailychatter.com/][Daily Chatter]]. They've been great at helping me keep up with what's going on in the world, including events that aren't getting as much attention as they should. For the past couple weeks though, I haven't been reading them. They just didn't seem to be worth the few minutes they took to read anymore compared to everything else I could do.

I've been relying more on weekly podcasts to keep up with the news, but even then I put off listening to them because I don't feel like it was time well spent. I know more about what's going on in the world, but I don't gain any advantage from that and frequently feel more depressed as a result. My goals and the methods I'm using to achieve them remain the same, I just keep getting reminded of how little progress on them is being made.

However, I still think politics is something I should pay attention and attempt to apply rationality to so I don't actually stop following it even if it might improve my mood. So I force myself to confront the ideologues I oppose in the hope I can do something to help defeat them, only to accomplish nothing because they cannot be dissuaded from their position. Mental gymnastics isn't even the appropriate term anymore.

It's one thing for someone to believe that the end justifies the means since at least it recognizes the existence of a moral high ground and expresses an intention to optimize values. These people don't even believe they're doing that anymore. They actively reject the idea that there is a moral high ground to reach for, everyone is corrupt so there's no reason for /us/ to try and be better than /them/.

They have no vision they're trying to build and no end goal they seek to accomplish, they believe they are fighting for survival against /the other/ and will anything to disadvantage /them/ no matter how petty, arbitrary, hollow, or illusionary that victory may be because admitting defeat is worse. I don't think this is a clash of ideologies or tribes anymore, I'm fighting against a culture of nihilism.

I once thought this culture was only spreading through terrorists and extremists in developing countries, but I was wrong. It's right here in the West among the uneducated, evangelical, casually racist, and impoverished libertarians (can't think of a better way to describe people who see government action as the source of their economic woes and say "the free market will provide" in response to any criticism).

A lot of extremists out in the big bad world have a /positive/ project, no matter how horrific it seems (see ISIS).

I've heard it argued that this sort of nihilistic, negative project is one of the selling points of a nation that isn't one of those sort of broken/developing nations: Russia. You cannot really claim to be the shining beacon of the world or be the ascendant power driving the international system and good norms so you instead try to drag down competitors who are actually good at that sort of -if you want to be cynical- propaganda (guess who). So the message just becomes that truth is relative, we may be lying but they're lying too, and they're just as bad as us so who cares about all the things they're trying to sell as important? Truth is inconvenient since you can be on the wrong side of it, so why bother.

This seems to also be spreading in the US and I think part of the point /is/ to tire you out. To throw enough non-sequiturs, tu quoques and just a ton of flak and confusion at you that you throw up your hands and say "Washington sucks, everyone is a liar, blah blah" so you can have an excuse to go with whatever parochial concern suits your immediate impulses more than trying to form a positive vision that's vulnerable to truth.

It's pretty dangerous and with the internet both allowing us to select our own echo chambers while making us no less partisan there's a huge problem.

**** I find it hard to see ISIS as an example of the end justifies the means mentality when they're explicit mission statement is to oppress or kill anyone who isn't a violently oppressive Muslim. In no way do I believe they represent Muslims or Islam in any fashion, nor do I believe they or any other terrorist organization are an existential threat to civilized society, but as far as I'm concerned they might as well be Nazis.

Everything else you said, however, I agree with. The concept of objective truth is breaking down across the developed world and I don't know how to fight that. I draw strength from my hope so they're trying to destroy that so I can't stop them. They have kept going long after abandoning hope, all they have left is their hatred of people and ideals that do not conform to their preconceptions.

***** I was holding ISIS as an example of a group that /isn't/ nihilistic or relativist. That was my point; even in developing countries or horrible parts of the world a lot of the extremists are selling a positive vision, they want to /create/ something, whether it was the triumph of the proletariat in the past or the rise of a Caliphate/whatever today, even if that vision is horrible.

If ISIS has had any success in motivating the sorts of people who agree with them it's precisely because they're putting forward an objective, positive (as opposed to just knowing what you /don't/ like) project.

Meanwhile a lot of what we're seeing in the political sparring today is the negative vision (everything sucks)or, at least, a positive vision marked with attacks on any pillar or institution that can challenge what's being sold.

I think "chauvinistic nihilists" or "nihilistic chauvinists" would summarize it without slurring "the enemy" /quite/ so much.

And I do think there's a productive course of action: build an institutional bulwark for /your/ positive vision over /their/ nihilism -- at least if you really observe them to be nihilistic.

**** I should probably read some more Young Wizards, but after being hugely disappointed in /Wizards at War/ I'm worried I won't like /A Wizard of Mars/. I found a lot of the books to be just okay even when they did fuel my hopeful outlook on life, but /A Wizard Alone/ may be one of my favorite books ever. Nita's struggle against depression resonated with me as an adult and that autistic kid (in the updated New Millenium edition) was exactly who I was when I was a child.

The only other story that's left me feeling that much raw hope for my life and the world in general is /Madoka Magika/. I'm definitely in the mental state where I could use another story like that, but its appeal was so subjective to my spiritual beliefs that I don't know where to look for something that would also give me that. I'm definitely rambling by this point about how I wish I just knew whether I would enjoy something before starting it.

**** I would add that while the rest of those come from privilege, this kind of nihilism that motivates action stems from a perception that they are being denied what they're entitled to. I completely agree that human civilization is doing better than at any point in history, but I think this political movement is an existential threat to civilization. Climate change policy is just one example of how these people are willing to drag the rest of us down with them.

I would have hope for things to get better, but where progressives haven't faced opposition it has failed to demonstrate effectiveness. The world is stubbornly refusing to get better when the majority of people agree on what should change and that is incredibly disheartening. I don't care if that attitude exposes a sense of privilege in myself, the belief that people deserve better than what they have is intrinsic to progressivism.

That isn't Nihilism. In the Nihilism described here people do not have particular moral values and instead are devoted to a cutthroat philosophy where you only deserve what you can get.

*** I think it's a pretty good idea to have some judicial body like this. The question is how to define their powers, and how to choose the people.

I think the U.S. Supreme court has a fairly narrow mandate in terms of what people have to pretend its powers are, but our government interprets that mandate about as broadly as possible. I'd rather the mandate were broader and the interpretation narrower, because I think the current game of finding consitutional justification for things you already wanted produces some unsatisfactory edge cases. But I don't think we can get from here to there.

Currently our method of choosing the people is more a mess than usual, because of reasons you can kiiind of round off to "republicans being willing to sacrifice principles for short-term gain." But I think that overall it's actually an okay method.

**** Making the judiciary more susceptible to democratic influence isn't necessarily the solution. John Oliver did a piece on elected judges where he revealed that they will pander to voting blocs by promising to rule the way they want to rather than according to the law, which usually results in tougher sentencing. Holding judges more accountable to voters means making them more vulnerable to populism.

Additionally, the majority of judges on the Supreme Court nearly always vote in line with the party that appointed them and that's how we got into the predicament we're in today. Nearly every ruling on civil rights is 5-4 with either all the Republicans together or one siding with the Democrats. That's not how the interpretation of the laws and ideals of our county is supposed to work.

I believe that democratically selected officials is a good thing, and this kind of argument that democracy leads to populism and bad outcomes might sound intuitive but is basically wrong empirically. Down with George III, imo!

One way we might democratize the Supreme Court would be for Justices to have 18-year terms, and every 2 years one of them terms out and must be replaced. A Supreme Court Justice who terms out can never again serve on the Supreme Court. This means that each President picks 2 Justices per term. Think about what happened with Garland and the trickery the Senate pulled because we have such long undemocratic processes for selecting Justices. Think about how much better a more Democratic system that I just thought up off the top of my head would be. Easy.

The zaibatsus (mega corporations) quickly surpassed the elemental nations in power, and subsumed them so completely as to take over their names.

  In the post-nation-state megacities of the future, amidst the towering skyscrapers and away from the neon blue glow of chakra streetlights, tight-nit clans of spies and saboteurs known as ninja fight each other at the behest of the elemental zaibatsus to whom they owe grudging allegiance. However, the status quo might soon be changing once again, as ninja puppets indistinguishable from humans have started to be sold by the upstart Rain Corporation.\\

  #+begin_quote
    At the Crossroads of Destiny, Katara sees Azula preparing to zap Aang. Desperate, she flings a shield of water across the room--but this only results in a transference of the electrocution from Aang to Katara. (Mineral-rich cave water? Spiritual interference? Handwave it however you wish.) Aang, still in the detached Avatar State, kills nearly all the Dai Li agents and deals severe injuries to Azula and to Zuko. As the Avatar State fades, Aang is overcome with horror at the destruction he's wrought, and (since he lacks memory of his Avatar-State actions) assumes that he's the one who killed Katara; however, Iroh arrives on the scene and says that it was Azula who did it. Aang is caught in a dilemma--kill the incapacitated Azula in a sorrowful rage, or maintain his principles?--but dozens more Dai Li agents are arriving, and Iroh exhorts Aang to escape up the waterfall, since Aang can't get back into the Avatar State and defend himself with his current feelings. Aang escapes, carrying Katara's corpse, and the Gaang leaves on Appa's back. The Dai Li take Iroh and Zuko back into custody, and send Azula to the royal physician's offices.

    Sokka's feelings are split between "furious" and "numbed". He presses Aang desperately for the details of Katara's death, but all Aang can say was that she was killed by lightning--and, though he relays Iroh's assertion that Azula's the one who killed Katara, he can't deny that, after he left the Avatar State, he saw lightning scars all over the cavern, and some of them must have been made by him while he was in the Avatar State, and one of them may have hit Katara. Sokka can't bear to remain in the same party with a person who might be his sister's killer, and is dropped off with Hakoda's guerillas at the first opportunity; Aang doesn't stick around to give Hakoda the bad news. The Gaang now consists only of Aang, Toph, Appa, and Momo.

    Kurenai stumbles across an obscure meditation technique--the old rhetorical trick of using a "memory palace" to improve your memory, enhanced with chakra to become a full-fledged genjutsu cast on the self. It used to be used by infiltrators who couldn't risk committing their findings to writing, but gradually fell out of favor with the rise of sealing-scrolls' popularity. She thinks it might help her students in developing a rudimentary defense against genjutsu and in organizing their thoughts in general. Kiba doesn't like the idea too much, but Shino finds the compartmentalization interesting and useful.

    Hinata, however, takes to it like a fish to water--indeed, she's too good at it. It doesn't take her long to realize that, whenever she's out of the Hyuuga compound, she can temporarily lock away her memories of her father's brutal training and scornful disdain, and feel like a free person for once in her life. The rest of her team is quick to note the meteoric rise in her confidence.

  Naruto: Balloonacy (placeholder title)

  #+begin_quote
    One day in Academy (two years before graduation?), Sasuke is feeling particularly angry. When Sakura asks him for a date, he snaps: "Do you know what I hate? I hate weak ninja--and you are a weak ninja. I've seen you, flailing worthlessly in sparring--panting with exhaustion after making three simple Clones--whispering with the others about hair and diets instead of practicing shurikenjutsu. Don't even talk to me until you can see my level from the bottom of the ravine that you're stuck in... weakling."

    Sakura is the only person who hears this one-in-a-million outburst. She resolves to train up her taijutsu and shurikenjutsu, as instructed--but she's at a loss in the area of chakra. Research at the library turns up a yellowed scroll containing the Harmonious Flow Technique--a simple precursor of the Mystical Palm, meant only to transfer chakra from the medical ninja to the patient (e.g., to remedy a case of chakra exhaustion). Sakura hypothesizes that forcing extra chakra into a person with a full reserve will stretch the maximum capacity of that reserve over time. To that end, she promises to go on some dates with Naruto after he learns Harmonious Flow (and the average-level chakra control necessary to use it) and helps her to train in taijutsu and shurikenjutsu.

*** I mostly just want to see a WH40K-style Warp (part-epic, part-Lovecraftian emotion-based magic) done /right/, with psykers being trained to actually produce specific effects in a directed way and Chaos Gods actually standing for something other than four vague varieties of insanity.

***** Non-vague non-insanity that's still more-or-less themselves, though I would like to see them as part of a wider pantheon. Sorta the way I'm thinking of it is:

- Chaos Gods -- formed from agglomerated emotion or belief that wasn't going anywhere else, and agreed with itself (so to speak) coherently enough to form a "great choir" (as a daemon once called the Chaos Gods from its own point of view). Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and Slaanesh all make sense /as their own archetypes/, but with the slight problem that they're too narrow to encompass all major emotions.

- Ordered Gods/Pantheon Gods -- the Warp entities corresponding to actual religious deities with defined personalities and roles, such as the Eldar pantheon, the God-Emperor (possibly separate from the real Emperor), the Abrahamic God, the Greek gods, etc.

- Daemons/Angyls -- Warp entities with a defining core emotion or experience, but without enough mass or power accumulated to qualify as a god.

- Small Daemons/Angyls -- /exactly/ what Pratchett described in /Small Gods/. Tiny little single-celled voices on the tides of the Warp, trying desperately to become anything at all with a real self or form.

The line between daemonhood and godhood would work roughly as it does in 40K. Daemons can be summoned into the Materium through a relatively small breach, but behave more like animals or persons when you summon them. Gods require a galaxy-sized breach in the fabric of reality to fully come through, but have enough power to mass-cast spells/miracles whenever they fix their attention on one point in realspace.

The difference between daemon and angyl is the same between Chaos Gods and Order Gods: daemons just sort of /happened/, while angyls fit themselves to a specific stream of emotion and belief coming from specific mortals. Neither one is /necessarily/ good or evil in alignment: you could make the God-Emperor Lawful evil, but exchange it for Tzeentch being Chaotic Good.

The major upshot of this for the setting and for main characters is: sorcery works by drawing power from the Warp. This requires careful control and stoking of the sorcerer's emotions, but also bothering to learn about what kinds of Warp entities you can channel power /from/. You, the sorcerer, might try to /choose/ a "good" source to channel from, but when you cast spells, you're still going to get /all/ the aspects of the being you're drawing on. Every love spell will come with a slight risk of Aphrodite driving the subjects into wild orgies; every spell for rot and disease will come with a chance that Nurgle's compassion grants the victims immortality.some of Nurgle's compassion.

The idea is to have a magic system in which everything carries personal and situational import, the potential for awesome power, /and/ the potential for serious danger all wrapped up together. No white or black magicks with morally reliable effects, just the wild magic of raw nature and emotion.

I think they are all encompassing but they are not meant to be pure representations of human emotions. They are meant to encompass the primary motivations for human activity based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types][Bartle's 4 types of players]].

Slaanesh - Achiever, always seeker greater pleasure

Tzeentch - Explorer, always seeking something new

Nurgle - Socializer, always wanting new friends

Khorne - Killer, always wanting enemies to fight

*** I had a fun mental image of a city-scale Orion drive ship being found decelerating into a straight up Star Empire.

So, I'm trying to come up with a fictional tech base which has several coinciding qualities:

1: Resemble in aesthetic and capability pulp/golden-age sf (gleaming rocketships taking off from spaceports full of steely-eyed men with rayguns on their hips.)

2: No active circuits, therefore no radio transmitters or electronic computers.

3: Low enough emissions in general that they can have an interstellar civilization without the flashy megastructures that would imply with known technology.

4: FTL travel, not signalling, to reduce the travel time within said interstellar civilization sufficiently to allow feudalism to have persisted, while not being able to reach our sun.

For parsimony's sake, I'd like this all to rely on the smallest possible amount of nonsense. This is where I need input. They need a few capabilities, I think:

1: extremely dense power storage

2: energy weapons

3: reactionless drives

4: artificial gravity/inertial dampeners

5: interstellar drive

3 and 4 can easily be the same device, an acceleration-vector-applier. Perhaps 2 is just a messy applier, and 1 is a stored force? My plan for 5 is that it only works to jump between the barycenters of binary star systems.

It would also be nice if the FTL doesn't destroy causality too much.

** By looking at old story fragments I've started and abandoned, I've come to the conclusion that basically anything I write will have some level of transhumanism due to its [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal][Author Appeal]]. My first impulse is to shrug and say "oh well", but on second thought that might not be productive due to the low general appeal of transhumanism, even if it has niche appeal. Speaking from your own personal experiences, is it more offputting when an author makes it blatantly clear why exactly they're writing their fic early, or where the author tries to sneak it in, but you still realize it halfway through the work because the author just can't resist going on author tracts about whatever?

*** I'm fine with authors writing about the things that most appeal to them, even if that results in them continuing to write about the same or similar things, so long as execution is on point and there are enough variants to keep me interested and there's still some depth to the collection of works as a whole.

Direct author tracts or moral messages I'm less fine with; my preference is for the author to present a complex picture that I can make my own mind up about. Now, that complex and nuanced picture can be colored and shaded by the author's own worldview, and in part I /like/ that, but if the author spends a handful of pages directly explaining /X/, where /X/ is some pet issue for them, my eyes tend to glaze over. This is probably, in part, a case of "show, don't tell", which many author's tracts violate severely.

*** Just don't call it transhumanism. Lots of fantasy and scifi works have had characters with superhuman powers or immortality -- let alone mythology. Calling fairly ordinary speculative-fiction tropes "transhumanism" just ties them down to a few cliques of people who thought together from the 1980s-2010s.
