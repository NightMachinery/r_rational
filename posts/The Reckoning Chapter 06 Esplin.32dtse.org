** Holy shit. Walk through this with me here, because Visser 3 has a horrible, horrible card up his sleeve. And possibly, so do the kids.

#+begin_quote
  Clearly, the morphing technology took more than just a DNA sample. There had to be some kind of scanning going on during the acquiring process, or else all kinds of things would have been different---I'd read, for instance, that height had almost as much to do with hormones and nutrition as it did with actual genes.
#+end_quote

It is confirmed that when you acquire a morph you don't just get the genes.

Now look at this:

#+begin_quote
  One---the Andalites had successfully replaced a human girl, with mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk. Conclusion: someone else in the Andalite chain of command had discovered Alloran's little back door.
#+end_quote

Alloran has a "back door" and the reason that this is brought up is because an Andalite has displayed "mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk."

Meaning? Acquiring a morph grabs the person's memories as well, and Alloran knows how to access those memories. Meaning that Visser 3 knows how.

Which means that Visser 3 wouldn't have to put a Yeerk in, say, Jake's head to find out everything that Jake knows. He would just have to acquire Jake, morph Jake, and then use the Back Door.

The one silver lining here is that the same goes for the Animorphs and accessing Elfangor.

*** Yep. I think that might actually be the key (or one of them) to giving the kids a fighting chance in this AU... or how they all get killed/Controlled :D It's important to note that morphing already gives you the creature's instincts and whatnot, so unlocking the memories hidden in the neurology should be a cool "aha" moment.

#+end_quote

If Visser 3's backdoor is related to the intereference in nervous systems between two instances of the same morph at once we saw in the previous chapter, it may be possible for him to get at Jake's memories by being morphed into the same morph as Jake at the same time. Any bets on whether Visser 3/Alloran has acquired Elfhangor?

*** If this theory is confirmed, I have to wonder how the Frolis Maneuver will factor in to this AU's altered morphing abilities and what that means to the plot, if it will exist in this fic at all.

Given these morphing developments we learn in these last two chapters, I wonder if that means a Frolis morphed person can access not just the shared DNA but the shared memories of the morphed individuals. I hope we'll see soon when Ax shows up! It could probably cut out a lot of Ax's brand of buffoonery with getting used to Human Stuff when/if he does the Frolis Maneuver.

I think we have confirmation that morphed bodies have their original memories.

I like that V3 is keeping open different possibilities as he thinks, and not just deciding that one or the other is /the/ correct solution.

There's a fic out there from the POV of Lex Luthor, where he meets with Bruce Wayne and has a little conversation with Bruce. "I know the truth: /You're funding Batman./"

** Wonderful job to the author of this fic, and the authors for this chapter! My only complaint is that the parentheses can be a bit confusing, are they used as an aside for their shared thinking, or are they thought-speaking to each other, replacing the greater-than/less-than symbols? Amazing fic overall, so far!

It's incredible to see the, IMO, very believable breakdown of how their thinking would work in this AU. What took book-canon Esplin three years to realize, only took him three days in this fic... These kids are in some deep shit.

I'm glad that it seems as though Esplin still has starts of being just as paranoid as his book-canon self, if not more so. It's one of my favorite things about post-TAC/THBC Esplin, and it'd just make no sense and be pretty boring if that were eliminated entirely from his character, no matter how competent and confident he is in a rational AU. I'm excited if their shared POV chapters become a regular thing, but if not, then I'm glad we at least got this chapter!

#+begin_quote
  Maybe some of the lonelier sort would morph and seek mates among the humans, as rumor said had been done during the conquest of the Hork-Bajir, on the homeworld of the Arn---perhaps Esplin and Alloran would give it a try, together?
#+end_quote

Hahaha! Oh Esplin, just couldn't help himself.

Though now that this was mentioned... I wonder if we'll find out how THBC and TAC worked out, if I'm understanding correctly, if a morpher loses their personal sapience when they nothlit? Will Toby even exist in this AU? Or can the nothlit issue be explained by there being new and altered Escafil devices by the time Elfangor gives the kids the morphing power?

I agree. It also seems like a fair flaw for a character with a rational to still have. He is so competent at most things, he can't empathize well or understand his incompetent underlings. He can think of all kinds of ridiculously clever schemes and attacks, so in turn, he is constantly on guard and expending effort on absurd possibilities (actually, this still might be useful if they are anything like canon!animorphs).

**** Paranoia, coupled with the stress of being a high-ranking Visser and being constantly frustrated by his subordinates, could possibly do a lot of damage and hinder Esplin and the invasion. If the author does choose to go down this road, I'd love to see how it's done to fit the AU in a way that isn't some cartoonish, Yeerk-Plan-Of-The-Week type of villainy like in the books. And if there's more Esplin/Alloran POV chapters to come, it could explain Esplin's seemingly irrational thought processes and behavior in a way that's completely rational /to him/ (and the audience) given his circumstances. Would that still count, I wonder?

Honestly though, no matter what the author plans to do, I'm excited either way.

** My first reaction to that 'snack' thing at the end was basically "Holy shit, Esplin 9466 Lesser is Visser Three in this one".

Now that I think about it, that's not very likely. Why would anyone tolerate Esplin the Lesser cannibalizing other Yeerks? Why would Esplin the Lesser even need to, if he had access to Kandrona rays?

I could come up with some justifications for that (Esplin refuses to leave Alloran for any reason, even Kandrona, because why would you make yourself vulnerable like that), but at that point complexity penalties negate any benefit for explaining the 'snack' thing so I'm not hinging my hopes on my idea being right.

EDIT: Esplin refusing to leave Alloran might /become/ a thing, if it isn't already. Was it just maple sugar or whatever that made Yeerks crazy, or did eating Yeerks do that too?

** This is my least favorite chapter so far, probably because I don't understand Visser 3's objectives as well as I do the human characters'.

We start off with him having just received a report. We, the readers, don't get to know to know what the details of that report were.

Visser 3 takes those details, and at one point suspects that the morphing tech has been revolutionized and that he now has something to blame besides incompetence of the yeerks for all the obstacles and delays they had faced. There's satisfaction and rationalization in this simple conclusion.

And then things get less simple, less rational, more complex, and we still don't know what exactly was in the details of that report. The character is now holding some kind of Omniscience Ball in place of actual problem-solving. What we have now is an very powerful character leading a large organization and making risky decisions off of irrational conclusions.

Then r!Visser notices the confusion of his host. There's facts that don't fit the mental model that has been constructed: Visser and the host are confused because no Andalite would leave the Controller alive. They are confused because they cannot explain the shape of the world. This is the basis of rationality. That lead to the conclusion (still flawed, still not a perfect fit) that Cassie is working with the Andalites.

We are literally walked through the character's realizations, and we see how it simplifies the mental map of events and makes them better fit the territory.

*** The report Visser Three receives is Ispec's testimony, including Ispec's conclusions regarding what "she" saw. Initially, Visser Three takes these conclusions for truth, because they match reasonably well with what was observed, and (as Cassie pointed out) a morph-capable human is somewhat inconceivable. It's only once Alloran is confused that Esplin remembers to switch on some skepticism, realizes that he can trust what his underling SAW but not necessarily what his underling THINKS about what was seen, and starts trying to reorder facts in a sensible way.

  *Occam's razor* (also written as *Ockham's razor* and in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin][Latin]] /lex parsimoniae/, which means 'law of parsimony') is a problem-solving principle devised by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham][William of Ockham]] (c. 1287--1347), who was an English [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan][Franciscan]] friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian. The principle states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but---in the absence of differences in predictive ability---the fewer assumptions that are made, the better.
