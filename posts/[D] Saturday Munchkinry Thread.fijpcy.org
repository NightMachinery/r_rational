Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You have a fantasy medieval/steampunk society on floating islands. The islands are held aloft by crystals that exert upward force proportional to their size until reaching a specific altitude. Most are burried within the bedrock of the islands themselves but can be mined, with caution to not let them escape. They come in various sizes from a few cm slivers to the massive 10+ meter diameter that hold up the islands themselves.

It takes a volume of about 1/3 a meter cubed to lift 100 kilos but lift scales up exponentially with volume.

The crystals emit radiation that is harmful with any prolonged exposure.

They also tend to cause water vapor to condense into droplets nearby via some field effect.

Crystals are constantly vibrating and emit a low hum that can be felt through contact with nearby surfaces and sometimes through the air.

What contraptions or inventions would you expect?

Some obvious applications are airships, of course, if you have proper containment, but what else might be invented?

*** The fixed altitude at which crystals stop providing lift would probably be useful for a measurement standard: a single crystal on a long string could serve as an altimeter, while a pair of small crystals linked by a string could be a horizontal equivalent to a plumb bob.

You can use the radiation emissions as a scaling factor for the size of vehicles you want to see. If it can be blocked with a thin sheet of metal, windboards might be viable. If even a thick safe can't block it, I'd recommend looking at examples of nuclear-powered rocket ships for design inspirations - Atomic Rockets is a great site for this, as the name suggests.

If crystals can be magically fused, the exponential gain in lift would incentivise a flying island civilisation to obtain a monopoly on the crystals to both give them more land and reduce their competitors for the sky.

The water condensation effect is a nice touch, that would give flying civilisations even more power over groundbound ones by influencing the rainfall.

If the crystals vibrate at a fixed frequency, they might be usable in clocks or as unfortunately radioactive musical instruments. If there's a way for crystals to influence each other at a distance, that gives you an equivalent to radio.

**** The crystals providing different force based on altitude means two similar-sized crystals can seesaw themselves infinitely, which has incredibly diverse applications.

Good thoughts overall thanks

*** mining crystals from inhabited floating islands is illegal. because if its not, the island WILL sink as they get mined out.

cost of crystals will define cost of shipping freight. shipping freight is hazardous because you need more crystals to move more cargo...

I imagine a cargo-carrier with the cargo in the middle, between the crystal and the crew. unless the cargo is live animals or passengers.

personal backpack crystals for infantry would be for high-risk boarding actions. crystal harpoons would provide lift to the impaled target, allowing it to be more easily dragged into the sky and aboard the ship.

crystal vibration may be used for industrial processes. ships would have shocks to reduce the amount of vibration the rest of the ship suffers as a result.

*** You can extract energy from the water vapor thing. The most obvious way is that the air becomes denser when the water vapor in it contracts into droplets, so large crystals will be surrounded by a constant downdraft, which can power a windmill. But you could probably do something cleverer with sealed pistons containing steam, which then collapse when near a crystal to do mechanical work.

In order to have floating islands, big crystals aren't enough. You either need distributed crystal (plus a ton of luck in the formation process), or you need the islands to be made out of diamond, because trying to support an island on a single crystal will just lead to most of it breaking apart and falling away. Basically what you want for the floating islands aesthetic isn't merely a crystal that itself floats, but a crystal that also makes rock touching it float. So if I'm a scientist who sees a floating island, I'm going to try making nearby rocks float using a crystal, and if it works, there's another way to extract energy (e.g. a wheel that floats on one side and falls on the other).

**** Good points, I was imagining the islands' structure being studded with a pretty even distribution of the crystals to allow even lift. Structural integrity is a factor I should work through, and whether the crystals can imbue surrounding rock with antigravity, as you suggest

I guess to have islands form and not just have lots of free floating crystals we need some sort of gravitational effect drawing towards the crystals themselves. Should imitate the formation of planetary systems in this regard. There is a massive central obelisk all the crystals stem from, after an initial shattering explosion. There could be some attractive force drawing them back together that results in orbits not unlike planetary bodies.

*** Scaling exponentially can mean basically anything depending on the exponent; you should pick one.

Does pressing two crystals together count as one big crystal? (If they're perfectly flush and flat?) If so, you can build a perpetual motion machine out of this - big vertical wheel carries a divided crystal through a channel that splits and rejoins the halves. When split it's too heavy to support itself and falls to the part where the channel presses the halves together to hit the mass threshold needed to float. The structure would have be below crystal-altitude, while most of society would naturally end up above that altitude (resting on crystals, not hanging from), so there's a tunnel or a journey down the side of a floating island involved if you want to visit the power plant.

*** Pretty much everything depends on unstated conditions. How powerful, wealthy, well guarded is your nemesis? What resources do you have?

As described "kill them in their sleep" is a pretty straightforward answer, since they need to be conscious to use it, but their specific circumstances change how hard this is to accomplish.

*** wait you said it couldn't be blocked. Can you explain the last bullet in more detail? Do you mean the user needs to look at the ring to use it and it can't be obstructed by liquid or solid? If so I would try and bait him to a cliff or somewhere he can drop into the ocean and hit him upside the head super hard so he loses consciousness.

Also you can just shoot him in the head. Half a second for activation time is an eternity compared to a bullet.

From Quora: [[https://www.quora.com/How-many-seconds-does-it-take-for-a-bullet-to-hit-the-target]]

A .45 bullet travels at 960 feet per second. Shooting someone 12 feet away means a time of 12/960 = 0.0125 or 12.5 milliseconds which is much smaller than the 500 millisecond activation time.
