Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Crack munchkin idea: What if you have telekinesis, but can only control dairy products?

​

So, a few days ago, my friend and I were chatting about lame super powers to get stuck with, and my friend suggested this one. I agreed with him, because it's disappointing that you can only use it if you're making chocolate milk, or trying to get frozen ice cream out of the container.

But then I /really/ thought about it.

There's a lot of dairy products out there. Cheese, condensed milk cans, frozen ice cream, spray cheese, not to mention all the products with milk as an ingredient. So, depending on how powerful the telekinesis is, you could probably use it to move a lot of things. For example, you could line your clothing with dried milk (or liquid, depending on the parameters) and then levitate yourself. A lot of things could be levitated/stolen if you could find a way to put milk inside or around them. You could fly a small drone without using any energy except your mind. No one would ever suspect you're lifting milk, and even if they did, how they would they find you? “We're looking for a suspect who bought a lot of milk products...oh, that's everyone.”

The perfect crime.

You'd even have an excuse to come up with the dumbest supervillan names. Like..."Cheese Whiz" or "Queen Frostine." Or you could go with simple weirdness like "Moist Milk" to creep everyone out.

Anyone else got any weird superpowers they'd think it would be fun to have? :)

^{(Also, sorry if this post doesn't entirely fit the parameters of this thread, I've just been thinking about it for like a week and decided why not, lol.})

But then, select one five year old who you "can't lift" no matter how hard you try, and then he lifts /you/.

****** Actually, this is an interesting question, because it would depend on how the telekinesis worked. If it's a force inside someone's stomach pushing up against their stomach walls, then yeah that would be uncomfortable. But, it's possible telekinesis applies force differently. Have you ever seen those shows where telekinetics float things with their mind, almost as if gravity stopped working? Well, it's possible that telekinesis could make someone "floatable," and make it easier to lift someone. (Then again, not sure how much dairy you would need to levitate someone from inside their digestive tract, lol.)

But honestly, if the telekinesis is raised to the level of performance art, then you probably won't rely on what's in people's stomachs, anyway. There's no way to tell how much is in there, or how fast it's being digested (besides, there are some weirdos who eat /sorbet/). So, you'd need to find other sources of dairy to use in the trick. You could place dairy in an item of clothing, for example, such as along your arms or in your gloves. Or you could have a stool or cushion that contains solidified dairy products, and then raise them once they sit on it. That way, you know exactly how much dairy you have, and can easily estimate how much force you need to apply to lift them. Also, the upward force will feel like it's coming from you, and not from their stomachs. :)

Otherwise, if you want just a bit of munchkinry: He later kills people by moving the dairy from their stomach into their windpipe. One of the characters is immortal, so the lactokenetic forces mozzarella into his brain to render him vegetative.

*** Really the question here is what's the limits on the amount of force that can be exerted, how precisely can it be exerted, what's the limit on mass controlled and what's you're range limit (if any). Also you need to know whether the person gets tactile feedback from their telekinesis and whether they can have their telekinesis act automatically without deliberate conscious control. This is important because for instance if you telekinesis can be "programmed" to act automatically then you can shoot people by making plastic out of casein then applying very raid force, or automatically have milk form forcefields to stop bullets just held together by the telekinesis.

Depending on the parameters above I can easily imagine this power being anywhere from extremely formidable to something that could easily allow world domination even in a setting with other superpowers (provided nobody has any divination style powers that would let them trace distant applications of your powers back to you).

** Slow shapeshifting:

Bloodline: You have a mental self-image, which is extremely detailed (to the limits of your medical understanding. If you are a lay person, this is skin deep. Double phd in biochemistry and surgery, it includes a whole lot of the underlying systems. Historically, this was a really fast way of testing if a medical theory reflected reality, since a member of the blood who believed something wrong about how the body worked would get really sick and potentially die. For some reason, not a whole lot of Blood doctors before the modern era. ) This image is stable unless consciously edited. You can change it via a meditative trance, and one you have done so, over the next several months, your body will change to match the new image. For major changes, this incurs quite a high metabolic cost - you eat enough for three people, sleep 12 hours a day.

Downsides: Major alterations to your long bones will fuck with your coordination - you can add or remove ten centimeters to your height, but you will be as clumsy as a teen who just had an equivalent growth spurt. It is, technically, possible to give yourself an entirely inhuman bodyplan, but you have to learn to use the new body the hard way. The power does not let you cheat. Being a centaur? Sure, but you are going to have to learn how to gallop with no instinct for it.

Alterations also have to be viable at all intermediate stages, since you will be spending weeks at all the transitional stages.

They also have to be biomechanically viable - you cannot make your bones superhumanly strong unless you can visualize in detail exactly where that strength is coming from, and a biochemical pathway for producing the relevant materials. And you have the relevant materials in your diet.

You can kill yourself getting this wrong.

Now, two questions : This bloodline is old. It does not breed true very often, but on the other hand, people who have it only ever die by violence, misadventure and doing something spectacularly stupid with the power.

1: What would you do with this power?

2: What would be some of the well-established techniques, given that people have been playing with it since, well, the invention of fire.

*** Just for clarification, this power only changes things which you imagine being changed, right? The rest of your body keeps working naturally.

In that case, given that I am physically immortal due to keeping my mental image healthy, I would make incredibly slow changes over very long periods. Adding small amounts of new neural tissue is obviously a must, though it might wind up taking the form of extra ganglia relaying more detailed sensory information rather than making my head bigger. Extra redundancy is a must as well. There are some evolutionary errors which could be fixed, like fixing that nerve whose name I forget which goes all the way up and down the neck to reach the larynx from the brain.

All of that pales in comparison to my primary goal, however: R&D. Since I'm physically immortal, accruing wealth and power is easy, and I would sink a lot of that into biomedical reasearch to find new ways of changing my body to be better. Discovering a way to make nanotubes, graphene, and other exotic materials would allow me to incorporate them into my body for strength, heat resistance, electrical shielding, etc. I could experiment with creating silicon wafers in my own nervous system to improve processing speeds, though connecting them up would obviously be difficult. Extra glands under my conscious control for directly controlling things about my body are an obvious improvement. If an experiment fails, I could locally turn off pain and accelerate reabsorption of materials to fix the problem. There's tons of options here.

My other primary project would be fostering peace. I can only die if someone kills me or I'm really stupid, and removing stupidity is the goal of the first project. Therefore, preventing potentially dqngerous wars and social strife is a must. I don't want to be the benevolent overlord, as those will be targets no matter how benevolent, so I would defer rule to normals and act in an advisory role. I could prevent the mistakes of the past by remembering history perfectly and relaying it to civilian leadership. I think my ideal position would be on something like the modern House of Lords, which is filled with experts in various fields who act as resources for the MPs. This would keep me out of the spotlight and close enough to the centers of power to still maintain peace and prosperity.

I would like to note that you're going to need to make this power both magical and non-hereditary, because if such an ability existed and it was /at all/ hereditary then it would have spread over the entire population pretty quickly from a evolutionary standpoint.\\
After all everyone with this power is probably going to be maximally attractive and strong enough to easily defeat any normal (prehistoric) human in combat using some basic body modifications copied from animals. So very quickly (on evolutionary timescales) people with these powers would end up the leaders of every tribe of humans and would very rapidly spread their genes into the whole population, until any children without the abilities ended up basically being viewed as deformed (and rarely ever breeding).

Your corporate enemies could reverse hack those connections and control all the devices in your company. And while your computer systems may have protections, the other devices like coffee machines won't have any. Your enemies could do horrible things like overheat machines to cause fires and turn off the fire alarms and sprinklers so no one notices until it is too late.

On the other hand, if your goal isn't to defend your computer systems but to attack other people's, then Bob is your most valuable employee. Just send him everywhere to connect random devices to the internet, and hire a team of hackers to exploit those unprotected connections.

This device can be mostly concealed in a closed fist. Assume that, while such devices that /can/ store (read: capture) humans like Pokemon exist, the one in your possession explicitly lacks this ability.

Assuming that you want to hold on to this device, so as to smuggle something useful into the facility, how could one go about doing this without it being discovered? I'm assuming that the initial intake will involve a cavity search.

Does the answer differ if the prison staff have knowledge of this type of device?

** browsing the [[/r/slatestarcodex]] subreddit recently I came across [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9is0vo/my_secret_power_is_being_invisible_to_women/][this thread]] and wondered as to its munchkinry potential. Let's say you have the ability to activate and deactivate selective invisibility to those who sincerely identify as female, as well as those "assigned female at birth" if they lack the cognitive ability for such self-identification (e.g. nonhuman female animals). This invisibility extends to the entire human sensorium up to the threshold of pain (e.g. women will not hear you or sounds directly produced by your actions unless you scream loudly in their ears). It otherwise also extends to anything you're wearing or carrying. The mechanism of action for this power is psychological, rather than physical -- you still affect the world around you as you normally would, it's just female perception that gets edited after the fact. So there's no physics-breaking taking place or anything. Causal chains initiated while your power is active lose their invisibility when no longer connected to yourself over a second's time, so if you roll a ball down a hill, the ball becomes visible shortly upon leaving your hands. Likewise, your invisibility applies to real-time image capture (e.g. a security camera) but not if there's a delay of a few seconds between capture and viewing. If driving a car with this power active, you are invisible but the car is not, so the car appears to be driving itself (unless you are physically carrying the car through non-technological means).

Is there anything special that could be accomplished with this power? Beyond just being intrinsically or scientifically interesting, I figure it could serve as a useful litmus test for those "uncertain" of their transgender status, which could be useful for those deciding whether to transition (esp. children on the cusp of puberty? if they've developed a sufficiently strong gender identity by then? I hear certain procedures are more effective if you catch them early and apply e.g. puberty blockers). You could also serve as a spy or thief in very particular settings populated exclusively by women? Maybe as a security guard for heads of state at women's only summits? Acting casually, you could also pass security checkpoints in female-gated environments, where nobody else has reason to look at you closely -- e.g. get on a bus driven by a woman and forego paying fare. Probably the best way to leverage this power is through publicity, though, rather than secrecy -- it should be enough to e.g. catapult your stardom, starting with the talk-show circuit and ending with your own celebrity? There might be interest in conducting (consensual) prank interviews with female celebrities where you turn your power on and off and they must adapt to the challenge, and the public at large would probably want to expose themselves to your power for its novelty? Assuming the effect is not perceived to be too invasive. You could also minimize risk in the context of training female zoo animals or something?

What would change in its application if this superpower applied exclusively to men, rather than women?

If I tell it to fake-report every 4 as a 3, does what would have been a blind spot turn out as a 3 because it would have been that both ways?

Write a script that, if it's a 3, tries hack #253 on some internet machine, and displays "success" if that got me control of the machine, and use whether she sees the fake-3 to know whether that hack would have failed, without the machine ever actually hearing from me.
