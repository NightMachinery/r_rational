I've been thinking about maybe getting into worm fanfiction, and I wanted to see whether some possible powers were completely broken.

*Power 1*(tentative name: 20 questions): The bearer can ask any yes or no questions by any means. These questions will be answered mentally as follows:

if the answer is true, yes, or >90% probability: Yes.

If the answer is false, no, or <10% probability: No.

Else: Sometimes.

The power is omniscient, but is limited by the character's ability to express questions. Tentative ranking: thinker 5.

EDIT: I have no idea how I forgot to include this: The user gets only 20 questions in a given 8 hour period. Any further questions will return random answers.

*Power 2*(Tentative name: black storm): This power revolves around the creation and control of obsidian, specifically when connected to the user. It can be divided into three main parts:

Part 1: Creation. The user constantly manifests an amount of obsidian equal to twice their body volume plus 3 cubic millimeters in any form they can envision that is connected to the user's body by other obsidian(Not subject to power 2 rules). If some is disconnected, that amount of volume will manifest within a second. Additionally, the volume of all connected obsidian will grow s.t. if that volume growth were spread equally over all connected obsidian, each surface molecule would be moving away from the center of a cross-section cut by a vertical plane intersecting it at a base rate of 2 inches per second(this number changes based on other factors)

Part 2: Control: The user can control the way that obsidian volume grows(as long as the total growth remains at the current rate) and move it around, including disconnecting a piece of obsidian from the remaining structure(when it is detached, controlling it becomes vastly more difficult, as will be explained below) However, the more precise the control is, the higher the volume being controlled, and the higher the range of control, the lower the rate of growth will be while control is being exerted.

(Precise formulas: base rate=2+log(volume of minimal size piece controlled)/10[for volume<1 decigram, else this term is zero]-log(mass controlled in kg)/10-log(range in feet)/2-log(total mass in kg)/4)

If any of those three factors is high enough, rate of growth will become negative to some degree. If control is exerted over any obsidian not directly connected to the main structure, 3.5 inches/second are automatically subtracted from the base rate before the other factors are applied.

Part 3: Manifestation: The user can manifest themselves in any piece of obsidian that is the user's body volume or greater as long as it always has a crosssectional radius of greater than 1 foot. This manifestation can cover as much connected obsidian as the user wishes that fulfills the second qualification. The user can manifest multiple times simultaneously in multiple pieces of obsidian. The number of manifestations running simultaneously is inversely proportional to how human each manifestation looks. If at any point any manifestation becomes disconnected from the original user, it will immediately become inert. The user can also terminate any manifestation at any time.

Benefits of manifestation: Each manifestation gains part 1 as long as there are fewer than 5 manifestations active. Each manifestation can independently use part 2 with range calculated anew for each. The user perceives what all manifestations are seeing simultaneously and loses any defined location while multiple manifestations are active.

Costs of manifestation: the base growth rate while manifestations are active is 2/(number of manifestations active)/sec, instead of 2 inches/sec.

Tentative ranking: Striker 6, Mover 4, Blaster 1, Changer 5, Brute 3


** Power 1 could be very strong and could allow for all kinds of information to be learned. If you think about why [[#s][Worm Spoilers]] you realize the value of this kind of power. Power 1 could easily replicate that effect with slightly differently worded questions ("is there a greater than 0.2% chance I get attacked today?") and also can tell you about the past ("was my dad really cheating on my mom?") or the present ("is Osama Bin Laden in Asia? Is Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan? Is Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan?..."). Very powerful.

I also don't think your classification for Power 2 is correct. Not sure the character is Mover, Thinker, or Changer. It sounds like the power is Master (for controlling Projections), Striker (for the short ranged obsidiankinesis) and Blaster (if you can throw the obsidian and make ranged attacks) and/or Brute (if you can use the obsidian to make powerful Melee strikes and protect yourself). Since the power doesn't let you change yourself, move, or think I don't see it as a Changer, Mover, or Thinker power.

*** Thinker's probably wrong, I've edited it out. With regard to the others: the manifestations basically replace the user's body--that's what I meant by no longer has a defined location.\\
Example: the user can mimic teleportation by creating two manifestations, having one move far away, then terminating the other. Changer comes similarly(because the user's "body" becomes obsidian)

** Power 1 would /never/ return "sometimes". Probabilities are statements of ignorance, and the power is omniscient.

For example, say that a coin has just been flipped, and is in midair. A human would say that has a 50% chance of heads, and a 50% chance of tails. An omniscient intelligence would know the momentum, elasticity, location, landing properties etc. and therefore have a 100% chance of being right.

I think I need some clarification on power 2, or else it's horribly broken. As I'm reading it, the person can create an obsidian body for themselves in some amount of time, let's say 10 seconds. After that, they have two bodies that can each create a new body in 20 seconds (leading to 4 bodies in 30 seconds total). Those four bodies can each create a new body in 40 seconds, leading to 8 bodies in 70 seconds. It's not exponential growth, but linear is good enough for most purposes.

*** When he says 90% probability, imagine he said 90% of the universes that branch out from this one. If the coin is already in the air, it's probably going to land on the same side in almost all of the universes, but if you haven't tossed it yet there's a lot more chaos.

They can figure out anything by asking it bit by binary bit with a bit of thought on the woridng. A trivial example is passwords a 8 byte password would take no more than 64 questions for example.

**** That does make it tricker.

One improvement on my idea is that what you've really got is a ternary rather than binary system, so you can go a bit faster and only take ~40 questions to get out 64 bits. The basic approach is to ask if the nth tenary digit adjusted by an appropriate random distribution is greater than some value. You'd want the distribution to result in a value greater with a chance of >90% if the digit was 0 etc.

** It's worth noting that true omniscience is impossible in Worm; Countessa or (by WOG) Coil are about the limit. (Also, Wildbow has said P =\= NP in Worm, so that's nice.) Still, "just" path-to-victory binary search 20 times per day is still a pretty darn decent power.

The obsidian one seems like it should probably have higher ratings, being an immortal shapeshifting teleporter and all. What happens if they try/need to create obsidian inside a wall? Any details on how their "shaping" operates (force exerted, flexibility etc)?

*** About obsidian...I wasn't quite sure how to rank it, given the rather quick losses of power and the melee only issue. Obsidian can be created inside walls. Shaping works by destroying and creating volumes of obsidian--reshaping a piece is actually destroying and rebuilding it.

** Power 1 is probably thinker 8 or 9. They can figure out any hero's secret identity with a fairly easy search (does it begin with A? B? C? Etc).

You should probably limit it somewhat. Perhaps it gives horrible headaches upon overusage? Perhaps when you ask a question it rips that knowledge out of someone's mind, along with thoughts and such they were having? Perhaps it could have a manton limit, and not work directly on humans? Perhaps, based on some hidden variable like how many parahumans you've stabbed, it gets more or less accurate?

Power 2 is rather confusing.

Does it concern education? No. Does it concern policing? Yes. Is it concerned with parahuman policing? Yes. Is he a high-ranking official? Yes.

Dinah's power seems to work on 'future telling through probability'. What I'm seeing this thinker-style power being, if you wanted to play the 20 questions to the max, is to function entirely on solid facts.

If you want 1 piece of abstract info needed to guess the future, you need to use the 20 questions fact gathering.
