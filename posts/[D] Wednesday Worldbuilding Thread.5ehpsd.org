Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Still idly planning out my /Timeless/ fanfic. Here are the rules of the world as presented:

1. You can't go back to a time where you already existed.
2. You can detect when someone time travels, along with what time they went to, and where.
3. You cannot detect time travel unless you catch it in the act; you don't know when someone is /about/ to time travel.
4. When someone time travels you have a limited amount of time to stop them before history changes.
5. When history changes, only the travelers remember how the world was, while getting no knowledge of how the world actually is.
6. Time travel takes time; you can't just return to the instant after you left. In fact, if you go back ten years and spend five hours in 2006, you have to return exactly five hours after you left.
7. Time travel does not appear to recurse at all.

Some of these are probably just good advice, not actually rules per se, while others might come from technical limitations.

Rule 7 is giving me the most problems. Let's say that you go back in time to the Hindenburg, due to plot reasons it ends up blowing up on the tarmac at night instead of by the mooring tower during the day. When you return to the present, everyone will think that was how it always happened (see rule 5), all records save those you took with you will have changed ... but everyone will remember /you/ thinking that was always how it happened. They might even have you on camera saying that you need to ensure the Black Cross Anarchists blow up the Hinderburg. So what the hell happened to that time traveler they all remember sending back?

I feel like [[/u/sam512]]'s [[https://qntm.org/hypertime][Hypertime]] might be up for the job, given some extremely specific stipulations about what directions the time machine is moving on the temporal sheet. That is, time travel to the past is "down" in hypertime, while time travel to the "present" is to the "right" in normal time (with no universe switching).

And then maybe patch the whole thing together with "also, it's really, really, ridiculously hard to change history".

*** Sounds like you've got it worked out pretty well, and I do like that you decided to go with In Spite of a Nail. It's just my personal view that history is caused by collective social forces rather than the actions of individuals. The rules of time travel are a little fuzzy, like in the show, but the important part of the story isn't how time travel works but what you use it for and I really like your plan for it.

The part of the show I find most irrational is the government's response to time travel. Not-Elon Musk builds a pair of time machines and either doesn't tell the government or they let him keep it at his company. When one machine is stolen they throw a special forces soldier, a history professor, and one of the nerds who built it who've never met into the past with vague orders. Even considering the limitations of the machine and short deadline, they couldn't do any better?

Then there's the fact that when the team comes back it becomes clear that history has been altered and they don't know anything new about their enemy, so they send the same guys again with just as much preparation. Shouldn't their boss be shitting themselves with fear at their complete lack of control over this situation? Three people you found in an hour have to fight an existential threat with no oversight or accountability.

It's not that I object to the silliness of the premise, I love pulpy stories where heroes are just thrown at a problem and have to improvise a solution, it's just that the story needs to be aware of its own absurdity. My favorites pull it off by making the characters take goofy situations seriously, so we still feel the emotional weight of the story. Unfortunately, I found the characters in Timeless too bland to empathize with.

**** It hasn't been fully revealed yet, but my impression of what the "full" story will be is that there are time travelers that predate the first instance of time travel that we see in the pilot episode and that this is all part of their design. They're not shitting themselves over any of this because they have foreknowledge of everything that Lucy/Wyatt/Rufus are doing. How that's possible in a world where history undergoes a number of changes based on time travel ... might have something to do with these changes being cyclical?

But it's definitely been implied that Rittenhouse is an organization which was created by time travelers sometime in the 18th century in order to either ensure that history happens as they know it did, or to ensure that history follows a path of their own design. And the primary bad guy has information from either the future or a parallel future that gives a guide to the past/present. (And if Rittenhouse has at least partial leverage over not-Elon Musk, then it's entirely possible that they're the entire reason that the time machine was built in the first place, via ontological paradox.)

But none of that explains why the /government/ seems to be okay with any of this.

I don't know. It seems on the edge of making sense somehow, but I don't actually have faith in the writers.

Is this because you can only return to the present (i.e. 2016 -> 1939 -> 2016, not 2016 -> 1939 -> 2006), or because time travel operates on a discrete level?

If the former, you could spin it as a need for time to adjust before more travel occurred. That might come with its own problems, however (especially with multiple travellers).

In the latter case, could you travel to the hour/day/month/year before you left? If you can't, can you travel to a precise time in the past, or only at multiples of the "unit time" (so you have launch windows for expeditions back in time)?

I just thought of a third possibility: while displaced in time you're using up some aspect of your present. So if you use 5 hours you should return to T+5h, because if you return to T then you'll have 5 hours of whatever negative reaction (e.g. being catatonic, being "removed from the flow of time" and reappearing at the end, cluster headaches, intangibility, or retrograde amnesia).

** I was working on a magic system based on fusing belief, sleight of hand, and argument.

Magic in this setting is being able to argue with reality well enough that the magician convinces himself and reality that it is different than what it is.

Say a magician wants to set something on fire. He focuses on the thing he wants to make combust, and then starts arguing with it (generally silently), trying to convince the item that it makes sense for it to be on fire, that its past history supports the idea that it should be on fire, that the narrative of the story so far supports the idea that it should burst into flames. What exactly he is arguing with is left a mystery -- whether the actual object can argue or if the magician is really trying to convince his own unconscious, and is personifying the object in his mind.

The rationally related part of this is that the arguments work best if they leverage cognitive biases, like a statistical outcome being more likely seeming the more details you add to the description, even though in reality that reduces the likelihood of the outcome, and things being more likely if the magician can make up a story narrative that supports them, and as many other such uses of biases and human irrationality as I can fit in.

That's the first level of the magic system. That form is slow and has trouble with large and unlikely changes, but can be useful for covert work. The next level up is sleight of hand in front of an audience. A stage magician that can do magic can perform the arguing aspect as part of his patter, and if he can do the sleight of hand/ stage magic well enough and convincingly enough that he makes some of his audience believe he actually did it, or even just want to believe he did it, then he can make the effect real immediately. For instance, if he performs an illusion of making someone younger using a potion in front of a gullible audience, he can make the person actually get younger.

This second level can also be used to enchant items. If he focuses his patter during the illusion on something that is supposed to be causing the effect -- say a healing potion, he can actually enchant the potion so that it can be used to heal people later when an audience isn't watching. This can also be used for making magic utility items and weapons.

The second level can be used off the stage as well. A magician could unload the guns of a gang, for instance, if he hired a number of men to be his patsies and pretend that when he waved his magic whatever at them while talking his patter this made all the bullets in their guns disappear. If he did this convincingly, then afterwards he could wave the magic whatever at the guns of the people who are not his patsies, and make the bullets in their guns actually disappear.

Another subtler aspect is retroactive belief magic. If a magician today convinces a bunch of people that yesterday he painted an amazing picture, this is not going to make such a picture appear on his wall. However, there can be more subtle effects. If the magician makes a large enough number of people believe that at some point in the past he took a potion which gave him permanent super healing, then he will get at least some accelerated healing now.

Self abuse is also a path to power in this system. If someone spends years doing things to themselves which they believe makes it so they deserve good fortune and god's favor, say, whipping themselves and going around in hair shirts while surviving on only alms and sleeping on a bed of nails, then after a while they will be able to use the first level far more effectively, their arguments with reality being more potent and easy for reality (or their subconscious) to believe.

This system allows me to use elements of humanity's rich history of stage magic and charlatanry in the story, as well as having magic which literally responds to the character's need and how much they feel they deserve to have the magic work and how well they feel it fits with their own personal conception of their life's story. And I can have debunkers actually destroying real magic by revealing the illusions that initiated it.

What do you think? What kind of holes/ munchkin opportunities am I looking at here?

*** The system for magic items seems like it could have a compounding effect. Could you use one magic item to make it easier for people to believe that other magic items work? Say you use one magic item to mimic the effects of another not-yet-created magic item in order to create that magic item. You could bootstrap into omnipotence somewhat easily as you use your greater and greater number of magic items to convince more and more people that you have more and more powerful magic items.

**** Good catch. Looks like magic items would need to have strong limitations on them. Possibly some kind of time decay after they are created, perhaps a fixed number of charges depending on the size of the audience used for creation, and perhaps limits on the kinds of effects, with more amazing effects requiring a larger and/or more gullible audience for creation. And something I haven't thought of yet to curtail compounding.

Also insane people able to believe in crazy stuff in their head will be extremely powerful. Which is a good thing since it offers opportunity for narratives.

**** I wonder if organized religion would have a tendency to co-opt the magic from more stage magician like folks, with church being the institutionalized method of gathering crowds, preaching being the patter, and the religion designed to make the crowd have faith in and not doubt the sleight of hand the preacher performs to make the items and perform miracles on members of the crowd.

I suspect the system is inherently unstable, with a tendency to mutate into something completely different from my idea of sleight of hand magicians who can do real magic, unless I keep the number of people who can do magic really low and rare.

Hilariously, one could almost argue that the present form of reality is a result of a super weak version of this system, with the placebo effect and various mental effects on people being the only things the magic can accomplish, magic items being very hard to create but existing in the form of the various religious icons that their followers believe will heal them or make them feel better, and organized religion having mostly taken over the practice just as I wrote above.

*** Moderately related, but The Emporer's Soul by Brandon Sanderson has a somewhat similar magic system. It works by having "stamps" which contain encoded information on an object's history (some true, and some changed to make an effect.)

This magic works better the likelier it is to be true, such as "this wood was eaten by termites" working in a prison but not a palace, but "water damage from the renovation of the room two years ago seeped into the wood, causing it to rot. The rot is possible because the maintenance crew dislike their new boss and are skiving out of work" would work very well, if the renovation, boss, and crew were all correct.

What I was thinking of consciously was alexanderwales' [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]]. He has a nifty system in that where people acquire more magic power the more famous they are, and that was what also turned me on to the idea of a system of magic that can directly interact with the narrative/plot. The magic itself in alexanderwales' setting wasn't related to what people believed about the characters, though -- instead fame just activated the character's inherent school of magic, giving things like shadow control or light control and so on.

Players whose characters die re-enter the party with a new character sheet, until some sort of consensus endgame happens.

The setting has magic-users, whose magic is that of Charles Stross' Laundry Files novels: Lovecratian, mathematical, distinctly unpleasant if things go wrong. I think I have a working magic system, and plot and characters regarding that.

There's also a plot with an Edward Snowden character, some counter-intelligence spooks, and some reporters. Snowden is trying to hand off the secrets (a stack of floppies) to the reporters, but he doesn't know which reporters are true ones and which are counter-intelligence. Some may also be counter-counter-intelligence spies from foreign powers.

The party's setting is an American Embassy safe house in Britain, with the American Ambassador, the American Charge d'Affaires (a magic user), a British magic-user, two reporters, two spies, an embassy security person of some sort, likely an American magic-user not aligned with the Charge d'Affaires.

I need more characters, both as start-of-game filler and as mid-game filler. Angleton is a possible late-game filler character, as is a magic-aware SAS operative.

What sort of people are plausible to show up at an unofficial Embassy party in Britain? Why would those people not leave the house once people start dying? Why would new people enter the house? Where would they come from, and why were they late?

** Scifi Worldbuilding: If a reactionless thruster exists...

Am trying to think my way through some basics of a scifi setting, and could use some help on details.

Assumption 1: The theory of "quantized inertia", as described at [[http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.com/]] , is at least roughly correct.

Consequence 1: Reactionless thrusters similar to what's currently called the "em drive" can be built.

Consequence 2: Anyone with the tech to lob a package into LEO can create city-destroying WMDs, by simply accelerating an object into deep space and back at arbitrary speeds.

Question 1: Assuming that a standard reactionless thruster weighs around 80,000 kg, takes 60 MW of power, and produces 750 Newtons of thrust (plus or minus whatever fudge-factors make the math easier), what timescales would be required for how large a kiloton-equivalent impact?

Question 2: "There Ain't No Stealth In Space", for any object near room temperature... but could a reactionless city-killer be kept cold enough to evade detection, until it was approaching Earth too fast and too close for any significant response?

Questions 3+: All the questions. :)

*** Let's look at question 2 first. Any real vehicle would require things like power supplies and structural elements and so forth that would slow it down, but lets say that we use magic to get rid of all of that mass. So we have a magic ship that is made of one of these thrusters in space, at rest, at a temperature of 40 kelvin or so, the same temperature as local space within the solar system. It's nearly invisible at this point, unless someone sees it occulting stars. It turns on its thruster for one second, applying a force of 750 N to its own 80,000 kg mass, accelerating at 0.009 m/s^{2}, to reach a final speed of 0.009 m/s. Its kinetic energy, 0.5mv^{2}, is now about 4 joules. But it dumped 60,000,000 joules of energy into the thruster to get that. As long as conservation of energy holds, the rest of that energy is lost as heat. Your thruster will heat up until it reaches a stable point where it is emitting all 59,999,996 watts of that, hopefully before it melts.

For comparison, Pioneer 10's communication antennas broadcast with a combined power of 16 watts, and we didn't lose contact until it was 80 AU away, twice as far out as Pluto. Granted, these were directional antennas and we mostly knew where to look, but... six orders of magnitude.

Back to question 1. One kiloton of TNT is 4.184*10^{12} joules. In order to have that much kinetic energy, an 80,000 kg mass has to be traveling at about 10,000 m/s. First, let's look at just an inert 80,000 kg mass being accelerated only by gravity. Earth's escape velocity is 11,200 m/s, which is a bit higher than the 10,000 m/s we need. This is also the speed that any object will reach if falls towards the Earth from rest at infinity. We don't have infinite distance to fall, but gravitational force falls off so sharply that most of that acceleration happens up close. I don't feel like doing the calculus to get the exact number, but you can expect to get around 1 kiloton worth of boom just from gravity, if you start any decent distance away. If you're going faster as you approach Earth, then its gravity has less time to accelerate you... but then the faster you go, the more bang you get for every m/s you gain. I'd expect it to fall off real quick the faster you go, so saying you get 1 bonus kiloton from gravity no matter what is probably reasonable-ish.

And you're going to have to start from a decent distance away, if you want your thruster to help at all. With acceleration around 0.009 m/s^{2}, adding another 10,000 m/s would take 1,000,000 seconds (12 days), and a runway 5.6*10^{9} meters long - 15 times the distance to the Moon. In order to get that far away to start, the thruster would need to accelerate away for 770,000 seconds (9 days), then turn around and brake for another 9 days, before starting its final 12 day return trip, for a total start-to-impact time of 2,600,000 seconds, or 30 days. It would spend most of this time brighter than most stars, giving everyone plenty of warning to shoot it down.

As it happens, the bang you get is exactly linear with the distance you accelerate. You get one more kiloton for every 5.6*10^{9} meters you go, excluding gravitational acceleration - which is fine to exclude since almost all of that acceleration will be far away from Earth. And it still takes a month just to get the first extra kiloton, and that's plenty long enough to get shot down.

Question 3. My favorite problem with reactionless drives! In my first paragraph, I said that accelerating for 1 second from 0 m/s to 0.009 m/s results in 4 joules of kinetic energy and 59,999,996 joules of waste energy. And after all, from the thruster's own perspective, every second is the first second of acceleration from rest. But what happens if it accelerates for 1 second from 80,000 m/s to 80,000.009 m/s? It starts with 0.5 * 80,000 * 80,000^{2} = 256,000,000,000,000 joules of kinetic energy, and it ends up with 0.5 * 80,000 * 80,000.009^{2} = 256,000,060,000,004 joules of kinetic energy. It has pumped 60,000,000 joules in and gotten 60,000,004 joules out, with a waste of, uh, -4? Not only is this a different number, it's over unity! Reactionless drives don't just violate /Einsteinian/ relativity, they violate /Galilean/ relativity! I don't know how to fix this without throwing out conservation of energy. And if you're doing that, then you can just say that there's never any waste heat and let it be as invisible as you want. But that also means that you can deliver free energy into any external mechanism that slows it down.

*** I don't really read romance and I'm a straight guy, so I doubt I'm in your target audience, but I'll leave some thoughts here anyway. If you don't find them useful, feel free to ignore them.

  Besides, after the reaming out her captain gave her for wearing her favourite pair of purple contact lenses on the job, she wanted to make sure she was the paragon of a good police officer.
#+end_quote

For whatever reason, this read more like the opening of a parody than a serious story. A policewoman wearing /purple/ contact lenses to her job (and she's not new to it - she's been at enough traffic accidents to know what a first responder should do), and then getting told off for it is just so off the wall as an introduction for a character. Maybe you're doing it intentionally to subvert expectations, but I guess it just seems silly to me.

#+begin_quote
  She ran beside the old sedan, using her phone's flash for light, and she saw something that she lacked the facilities to fully comprehend.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  That wasn't the disturbing thing; Jack had seen her fair share of mangled bodies. No, the passenger was not lying prone, not in shock. Instead, she had her head nestled in her unconscious companion's neck, her hands wrapped around his head, pulling him even closer to her than the impact had.
#+end_quote

As of right now, Jack has no idea that the passenger is a vampire. It's entirely in character for Mavis to be shocked/scared/distraught after the crash and hugging the driver, or burying her head in the crook of his neck (maybe even sobbing). As long as those are still halfway possible, Jack shouldn't be more disturbed by how Mavis reacts to the trauma than the sight of a ruined arm or a potentially dead guy. She's seen other accidents before, anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Jack felt a primal fear in her, something profound, like nothing she'd ever felt before. Quick reflexes - hard won through years of martial arts - ended with her pushing the wooden stake through the woman's heart, its passage made easy by the previously broken ribs and torn flesh.
#+end_quote

This doesn't feel realistic to me at all. (Also, aren't the splints described as 'two thin sticks'? That doesn't sound consistent with a stake that pierces through to the heart.) Jack's character isn't super consistent so far (is she super invested in acting professionally and following rules, or not?) but going from 'let me splint you' to 'I'm gonna stab you for freaking out and backing away' in a split second seems unrealistic, especially if she's under some sort of magical fear effect, and doubly so if she's learned martial arts. Usually they teach you to drop back and raise your guard if you feel threatened, not to stab whoever's nearby with whatever weapon is in reach.

#+begin_quote
  Canines that were about an inch apart.
#+end_quote

I feel like that's too short of a distance, but I could be wrong. It seems like an easy thing to double check though (for you, at least - to get an estimate of the distance between a woman's canines, you can measure your own mouth).

#+begin_quote
  All at once, she realised that either she was going crazy, or Mavis was an actual vampire.
#+end_quote

You should probably try to establish Jack's character a bit more, so that her jumping to conclusions like this doesn't come across as much as authorial fiat. Maybe Jack has an interest in myths or something, and has a book on Eastern European folklore in bag that she thinks about while on her motorbike. You can probably come up with something better, but think about how you personally would react in that situation. Would your first thought be 'everything I believe is a lie', or would it be [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/]['I notice I am confused']]?

I'm not really sure about the rest of the chapter. In large part, it fails to move me much because the preamble didn't hook me in and so I don't really know if Jack's behaviour is normal (for her) or not. It's consistent with some parts of her actions, and inconsistent with others.

I do want to add that it's well written from a technical perspective. There's no big spelling or grammar errors (that I noticed, at least, and normally I'm pretty good at picking them up) and the flow of the sentences was good.

**** You're such a champion for reading this for me and for giving me such an awesome critique! I will definitely be giving it a second pass with your input.

I'll give you some clarification for the reasons for some things being the way they are, though, as I have made the error of presenting something stand-alone that very much isn't.

Firstly, this is a scene in a longer story, so hopefully people will already be invested in Jack by now. That doesn't help you at all, and ideally every scene should be gripping, but hopefully that makes you feel a bit better.

#+begin_quote
  A policewoman wearing /purple/ contact lenses to her job
#+end_quote

This has two functions: the character of Jack was originally conceived when I was 14, and in true "character you create when you're 14" fashion she had purple eyes. So the /purple/ contacts are a little bit of a nod to that - which I know has literally no meaning to anyone else. Also, now I think about it, if she was reamed for wearing the contacts, would she put them back in immediately upon getting on her bike to go home? Probably not.

The /important/ reason for the contacts is that vampires can give you orders by making eye contact with you, and if Jack is vulnerable to that this story doesn't happen. So Jack needs contacts or glasses. Your pointing it out has made me realize that I should give her a slight vision impairment requiring eyeglasses or contact lenses and stop trying to be cute.

(There's two points in the passage where Mavis tries to give Jack an order and is surprised when it doesn't work.)

Thankyou for that. I meant the narration to describe that she didn't comprehend that it was a vampire feeding, and thought it was a wife mourning her husband or similar. But the writing is not clear at all that that's what I'm going for.

Yeah, I'm bad at action scenes and the concept behind this is very weak. I need to give her a stake so she doesn't just get eaten, and I need her to use the stake when she gets attacked. Otherwise, she gets eaten and there's no story. I tried to handwave this a bit by saying the car accident had injured the vampire, made its chest more squishy and its heart more stab-able.

Maybe I should come from another angle. Conceptually, I wanted her to rock up to her house with a vampire and panic about what the hell to do with it. But perhaps she just sees Mavis, manages to escape without getting eaten, and now is wondering about vampires. Perhaps it's an experience that happens to her, sans the staking, that gets her curious.

Maybe I should re-write it so she revives the man after Mavis runs off, he informs her that Mavis is a vampire, and Jack hears all about it while she waits for an ambulance (that she will decide to call) to arrive? That's a more realistic, conservative chain of events, Jack can obsess about tracking this guy down to get more information out of him, trying to find out about Mavis, talk to Gwyn about the whole thing, and only come home with a staked vampire /later/, after she knows that a stake will be needed.

I got three cm when I did it, which is why I went for an inch. [[http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t08/i2/jbct08i2p6.pdf][Someone's actually done a study and it looks like 2.5cm is average for a woman]]. Clearly I either have a /really big/ mouth (their SD was 1.5mm!) or sticking my fingers in a mouth then sticking my ruler on my fingers is not as accurate as what the scientists did.

You're right about this, too. I think the "waiting for the ambulance" version of the scene will hit this note.

If I edit it as discussed, do you think the inconsistencies are improved? The inconsistencies I get from your review are the purple contacts and her attacking Mavis, but I'd be very, very keen on hearing about more. I feel like Jack is well-developed in my head (such that I had a knee-jerk reaction that she would absolutely /not/ be interested in "all that folklore shit" as she'd put it) so I'd really like to be challenged on that, too, since at the moment I am like "Jack is the one thing I know for sure", and if that's not true I need to work hard on her. As it is I kind of think of her as a quasi-Tulpa though I never tried to make her so.

Thanks again for your comments, they are exactly what I needed. I think I am trying to make everything happen all at once, when there'd actually be more of a buildup, you know, a little bit of the veil lifting at a time. Why rush things?

***** Most of the issues I had with it were based on the (mistaken) idea that it was the opening of a story. If there's some background to Jack, and the reader is already invested, then the scene is fine (if a little quick to get to the action, maybe). Whenever I've tried to write, properly pacing things has been the one thing I completely suck at - either I write exposition dumps or super-concentrated plot, and neither of them work well on their own - so I can't give you any advice on that.

The edits you've mentioned would get rid of pretty much everything else I'd consider an issue with it. It looks really good, and I wish you good luck with writing/publishing it!

****** Thanks! Because it's a novelisation of an RP, this is part of the "action girl squad" book that my RP partner is writing (even though I wrote this section because it's "my character", she'll ultimately re-write or edit it for novel form), and I am writing "a vampire falls in love with an american ww2 deserter who is scared of death" romance story.

My RP partner is unfortunately not part of the rationalverse, so when I start going hardcore on my story in January, if people enjoy it there will be Rational Gay Vampires Kissing being posted here and the more "Rationaliseable" plotline of "people killing vampires" will not be made so.

Thanks for your well wishes! I'm not planning on publishing it beyond putting it on Amazon for $0.99. We mostly want to be able to show our parents what we did for 5 hours every night after school back in the day.

Still not 100% happy with the exposition at the end, but at least now it's a relatively logical chain of events.

Thanks yet again, your comments were excellent!

** I am making a victorian horror setting loosely based on Bloodborne-Castelvania-WoD.

Things I want to achieve:

Lots of different monsters.

Some monsters as vampires and werewolves are smart and common enough to form communities (secret or not)

With few exceptions mosnters are reuslts of human doing experiments on humans.

A fluid mix of gothic horror and Cosmic horror.

For making the setting I need one or two big events/changes from real world and derive everything eles from them. Explain

magic (not sure if setting has magic) and mosnters from it.

Probabaly something to do with Old Ones. Any ideas?

** Here's a neat little trick / datum you might want to use:

#+begin_quote
  There is still more space in the baseband to insert a few more narrow band mono audio programs. You would need a special FM tuner that can switch over to these "SCA" (Subsidiary Communications Authorization) channels embedded into the baseband. Back in the day, radio station owners would lease these SCA channels to companies like Muzak. Muzak would then use the SCA channel to broadcast their own music meant for malls, hotels, elevators, ETC. Muzak would sell the rights to carry their music format to the malls to use. $$$ Reading for the blind services would also use and still use these hidden mono program channels that can be received with the correct tuner.
