Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Some game recs:

- Monster Train: A rogue deck-building game. You need to build game-breaking synergistic combinations to win, so people here will probably enjoy it. I personally like it a lot, especially the undead class (which is not unlocked at the start, unfortunately).
- [[https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/]] : A catalogue of a lot of flash games. Kind of like an App Store on Windows where everything is free and without microtransactions.
- [[https://amanita-design.net/games/machinarium.html][Machinarium]]: A 2D puzzle point-and-click adventure with superb hand-drawn graphics and very good puzzles (and some not so good puzzles which you can skip by playing a minigame and unlocking hints). Old, but one of the best games I ever played. It's also a Flash game. (It's such a shame Flash died. The gov should force these things to become opensource upon dying.)
- Antichamber: A 3D puzzle game with unique graphics and non-Euclidean physics, where you have to seriously challenge your intuition and assumptions to proceed.

An anti-rec for Delve, since I have seen a lot of recs for it in this sub, even though the response on its own threads here is mixed. I regret reading Delve a lot. It's bait-and-switch; Delve starts as a slow-paced litrpg that focuses on running some numbers in choosing what skills and attributes to take, and has good writing on the RPG system itself. It also has that experimentation attitude we all adore. Unfortunately, other aspects of the writing are quite bad, and the author switches to slice-of-life around chapter 45, and the whole RPG system pretty much disappears from the story. The MC is also a complete moron in social skills and game theory, and even his supposedly rational build turns out to be mediocre as he has trouble beating monsters half his level, and is, in fact, more a poignant demonstration of the fact that we nerds often dedicate a lot of attention to some noncritical but interesting area while ignoring what matters. All in all, we get the story of a rational-wannabe failure whose life goes nowhere, while the narrative pretends to be still following a disrupting hero.

*** Rain's build technically isn't too bad, as some number crunchers have found out that his damage skyrockets into the millions once he reaches silver, but you're right in that he completely ignores the crucial fact that his build is worthless until then, which is pretty much a death sentence for anybody without protagonist plot armor. Basically everything he does is completely idiotic and a death sentence too, but luckily his protagonist plot armor saves him from the stupidity of his actions.

It had potential until it moved away from the litrpg optimization and moved into the typical isekai idealism, sadly. Quite baffling too, the way the author shifted focus. It's like a thrilling mystery/horror novel suddenly turning into an eroge harem romance halfway through a mystery. A real shame

***** That's definitely true, moving the story into another genre can be doable depending on the story and execution, but Delve falls flat in this. Despite 100+ chapters, the characters have no depth or even anything interesting about it. I've read some real shitters of a novel and most of them still had more interesting characters. Even a short story introducing an ordinary character like Worm does with Kevin Norton are far more appealing than Delve's characters with far fewer words.

****** I think the author has bathroom syndrome. There's a reason no one details multiple normal bathroom experiences in any kind of fiction. Similarly this author, and many other web novel authors, describe in explicit detail functionally identical character interactions. Sort of like Robert Jordan with braid tugging and skirt smoothing. You describe their nervous tics once and then just say or ideally imply that they are nervous in later situations and the reader can infer the tics or not.

I blame anime conventions for this. Eastern novels that are essentially written anime do this all the time. Cheek puffing, pouting, etc, possibly because anime uses an excessively emotive way of communicating. Authors in and and influenced by anime adjacent genres seems to think that writing the same character but with different behavioral quirks for each "character" is complete characterization.

***** It's a bit hard to explain, but surely if you've experienced a lot of isekais you get this feeling a lot. The MC is always reincarnated from the modern world, right? And almost always, the world is either a medieval world or a world equally as ruthless and warlike(or else conflict wouldn't be as common as the setting dictates).

The MC always retains their naive modern sensibilities and try to brute force their modern beliefs onto the new world poorly. It's like pushing a square block into a circle hole. Its always implemented poorly, without taking into account the circumstances of the new world or the way the residents think and grew up. It's a bit hard to concisely explain, but I'll give an example in terms of Delve.

Rain has been trying to force democracy onto Ascension, right? That's his isekai idealism, and while we all know that democracy is pretty good, Rain does it in the most ignorant and naive way. Delve's world is cutthroat, set into the medieval era where might is right, and especially so when higher numbers are stronger, and in Delve's case higher levels are /exponentially/ stronger.

Unawakened have no power or voice for themselves, and low leveled unawakened have to remain paranoid of higher leveled ones. It's very cutthroat, where strong people will literally kidnap smiths, healers, and supports who can't fight them off. People kill each other over the Lair titles(I forgot what they were called). There are noble houses that accumulate power and resources and oppress people whenever they feel like it, as has been shown by Velika and the Citizens. Keep in mind this setting and how it has affected the people.

Rain comes along and doesn't like this and think the common people shouldn't be oppressed and everyone should be awakened and so on. No shit that's good, but he's naive about that. He doesn't think about that if he ever gets close to implementing this on a large scale, those in power would easily crush him quickly.

He starts with implementing democracy. That's nice. How does he do it? He basically tells the group that democracy is nice for these savage and uneducated heathens and that they should do it. Everybody else is literally confused about what the hell is going on, and he gives them a very basic run-down. He starts it off with a democratic vote, and what does he do? He glares at everybody until they all vote for him.

How is this supposed to impart and educate them on the positives of democracy? It's a bastardization and farce of democracy, as idealistic and naive as a kid declaring they can have world peace if everybody promised to be nice.

That's what I feel isekai idealism is, and how a majority of isekais have this flaw as well, with modern people trying to poorly implement their modern beliefs, with help from the author's bad writing to push things through, which can be obnoxious to read.

*** Re: Delve, it may be about to get better. Chapter stamp: 136. Apparently the author had an arc planned from the beginning that just culminated with an event. The litrpg aspects are about to take up renewed focus.

That said, the pace is still glacial. I suspect it'll be a gripping read in novel form, but as a webnovel it can be rather torturous in its plodding.

I disagree that his build is worthless... If he had any other build, he would have needed a lot longer to reach level 18 and so would not necessarily be stronger after 6 months of being there. It's an okayish support build but it's a build that will scale very well at higher level. It's true that it's not a good build to solo out monsters but having a build that's useful for support could make sense in this world where convincing a strong team to help bring down a blue is needed for advancement.

**** Yes, the build is not worthless, it's mediocre, as I said. It's fast to train, but as the main bottleneck is the level cap, this is not the best of trade-offs. Rain also has made the shitty choice of not taking any of the good offensive auras (shroud), and so he has trouble channeling damage.

The problem is that Rain is an idiot and can not do anything social. He could already take a big blue with all his OP friends that the author provided, or he could just take one by trading for that damn bubble, but no ...

Anything that scales the tiniest bit will get all "soulstrained" out. It's clear that the author doesn't want Rain to grow, as that would require writing something /new/.

** I've been reading [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][/Vacant Throne/]] by towercurator for awhile, and with it wrapping up, it's as good a time as any to recommend it.

The story starts with a young woman, Alyssa, who is about to be murdered. Except she happens to see the angel who's come to collect her soul, and is able to avoid her fate. Since she's supposed to be dead on Earth and would interfere with the fate if she was alive and walking around interacting with people, she gets dumped on a different planet, Nod. Like many Isekais, it's a world of magic and monsters in a medieval setting, and Alyssa decides that if she's going to live here she'll need to adapt, learn magic, and get a job. She has to start from scratch and survive in a dangerous world (though she does have a gun where other people fire arrows) while her power grows.

The world is pretty well described. There's history there, though often it's more alluded to than explained. Alyssa does travel around a bit, and we get to see more of Nod a she does, and it feels lived in, with politics, factions, religion and class differences.

The writing is well-done. The style is pretty straightforward, and (to my recollection) there were no spelling/grammar mistakes.

The characters are well-written. The story focuses almost exclusively on Alyssa, but we see the story develop through some of her companions in some interlude chapters. Side characters don't get that many lines, which I felt was a shame since there were some really interesting ones, and would have helped flesh out the story a bit more instead of it centering just around the main character.

I did have a bit of a problem with pacing. Sometimes I felt the story went on longer than it should have, especially the parts that involved travelling. Though even those parts were enjoyable, to a degree. There were also times when I felt like Alyssa's character development was a bit too slow, or even took a step back, mainly in the way she looed down on some other characters for something that wasn't their fault, or even was spiteful to someone who was helping her.

Overall, I very much enjoyed the story. That Alyssa has to work and earn her power made the payoff that much better than if she had simply stumbled into it. I like how genuine the character were, even the more outlandish ones. I'd recommend the story mainly to people who like stories that focus on figuring out and developing magic, since that's a huge part of it.

This story is NOT rational; The MC completely ignores many super obvious exploits with her earth tech and just generally "good" things she could do that are obvious. The world also lacks a lot of "obvious" things which would be a consequence of the setting. (Which I am happy to expand upon, for those curious)

Like, an arsty but intelligent high school kid who hates everything in school except art finds the Secret of Gauss's Journal, which allows him to use the Mystic Pythagorean Arts to channel great mathematicians past, all of whom encourage him to pursue his much greater talent in math than in art. But he can only use the Arts for a certain amount of time per day so he has to actually solve the problems himself with only vague, incomplete hints from the mathematician spirits that drive him insane from the back of his own head. Each episode could have a different mathematician and we could see their personalities. Ramunajan thinks everything is obvious and can never explain his reasoning. Gauss never says the answer unless he is perfectly totally sure that his reasoning is utterly immaculate. Euler occasionally says stupid garbage on everything except mathematics. Galois constantly makes really uncomfortable analogies to French revolutionary politics. Newton and Leibniz show up together and constantly take pot shots at each other. It would be great.

**** I've got mixed feelings about The Pen is Mightier. The setting works well, and I'm a sucker for the Tower of God style "progression-based society". My main issue with it is that it feels like it's being written very quickly, with not enough focus being placed on the things that make it unique. SPOILERS in the paragraphs after this one.

The protagonist is set up as a more intelligent kind of climber that values other things over combat, and he's rewarded with a pen spirit that generates infinite ink. He never once writes with it other than to sign a contract. He spends a lot of words thinking about ways to transform the pen into a spear. I think these facts help illustrate the problems with the work.

The main character relies almost exclusively on combat prowess after the first scene, and only uses his intelligence to gain advantages in fights or munchkin the powers presented to him. Tens of chapters later, he has only laid one trap since the one that he had already laid at the beginning of chapter 1. He usually just chops things to pieces with an axe and gets compliments from his party members for how well he does at that. He's a far cry from the character as originally presented, much closer to a generic progression fantasy character, and I have to imagine it's a result of the update schedule and the outside pressure to keep the story exciting.

Reminiscing about his missing brother between bouts of murderhoboism is not enough to get the reader to believe that this is supposed to be a more 'romantic' character interested in storytelling and discovery.

Edit: As of the most recent chapter he has used his pen to write... after being explicitly directed to do so in order to design an upgrade for himself. Nothing that's meant to be read, by himself or others.

***** He continues down the path of becoming a bit too accustomed to killing. He gradually becomes stronger and more competent as an adventurer, participating in the contest put on by Emir (the gold ranker) in the iron rank restricted space. More stuff to do with the Builder's conspiracy, where he gets captured and tortured, but is broken out.

He and the team by this point are considered one of the better iron rank teams - possibly the best available in that region of teams that still consist of 100% iron rank members. For that reason they're eventually chosen/volunteer to go back into that rank restricted space to counteract something the Builder is doing there. The magic of the space is accelerating or whatever so through months of constantly fighting monsters they quickly get to mid-bronze and become pretty competent as a team.

Then the climax of the arc is a battle with some of the Builder's forces (and the vessel inhabited by the Builder itself) in which Jason heroically sacrifices himself, and dies.

After some interlude chapters, we find out the function of the world-phoenix token. Jason revives in the exact location he was born - a hospital (now out of service) in Australia on Earth. I'm not going to say any more about this plotline, but I will assure you that it's not done badly or in a "jump the shark" kind of way. In fact I've been enjoying the latest arc even more than the original arc, though this may just be personal preference. I do think the writing has gotten better quality overall too, though.

Oh, and yes - there is some grander goal, which involves both worlds.

That should give you something to go on :)

** I recommend [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34381315][The War Nerd Iliad]](don't mind the title ^{^{1}} ), a fantastically brutal, clever and funny translation/adaptation of the >2.5k year old epic saga of the siege of Troy done in modern language. Unlike other adaptations of that kind it also changes the structure and the tone in order to make the story more coherent and interesting to a modern audience, but without losing the cultural essence which makes this story so interesting. Simply the idea that people like Alexander the Great and Caesar and countless other emperors and kings read this book(or had it read to them)and idolized its characters should be enough to get you interested.

An excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  Odysseus sees that Thersites the radical, the jailhouse lawyer, is orating at Agamemnon, who's too stunned to react. Thersites is the ugliest man in the army, some kind of spinal case. A commoner too, and he's picked up a little ideology somewhere. He talks in a high, whiny voice, and he's on his usual theme: The Unfairness of It All.

  “You there, Agamemnon, ‘the king' as you high-and-mighty like to call yourselves, how come you get all the pretty slave girls, and we get the dregs? Why should your lot guzzle tender meat every day, whereas the ordinary soldier gets bread and a little oil? And how come ...”

  Odysseus wastes no time arguing about justice. He employs an older and more puissant rhetoric, hitting Thersites in the face with the tree branch. Thersites' teeth spray out of his mouth and he flies through the air, landing on his back, out cold. Odysseus turns to the crowd, growling: “Any more democrats?"
#+end_quote

If you've ever read a more 'scholarly' translation you'll notice it also omits all the lineages, the interminable "X son of Y son of Z" that happens every time a new character is introduced. This is by itself worth the price of admission.

^{^{1}} The title is a reference to a persona/alias that John Dolan took while writing a column in the satirical counter-culture newspaper the eXile. It was popular enough in its time that Dolan, a prize winning writer and poet, tried to capitalize on it by connecting this book to the persona, which is unfortunate IMO as I imagine the name puts off more people than it attracts. Dolan and another guy from the eXile founded a podcast a few years ago, The War Nerd Podcast, which deals with current and historical events/conflicts, again from a critical, counter-culture perspective. It's pretty good if you're at all interested in that kind of stuff.

**** Nice, I'm glad. I wish more people would give feedback after trying a recommendation.

As to the book, I'm the same. I tried the Iliad when was in my early teens after I learned that Alexander the Great idolized Achilles. Unfortunately my translation was by some stuffy brit from the 50's, full of footnotes and extremely dry. It was such a slog it actually put me off that kind of book for over a decade.

This book is perhaps more faithful to the tone the story held throughout most of history than any of the academic translations that quibble over this or that word. The Iliad is a story about warriors, for warriors, the kind of thing that rough men might share around a campfire or tell their children to get them into the right warrior mindset. "Remember when Menelaus ate shit, hahaha", they might say. Or that's my thinking, anyway.

*** 40 millenniums is a solid story, but be warned that it is looooooong. Like Chinese webnovels are extremely long. On top of that, some people find the first arc somewhat boring. It only really starts getting really good AFTER chapter 400ish when the second arc begins. So keep in mind you might have to stick to the story for a while before it gets really good. That said, when it gets good, it gets extremely good. Easily my favorite translated cultivation novel. It "borrows" a lot of inspiration from Warhammer 40k, but the author takes that inspiration and makes it their own.

Also when it comes to translated chinese cultivation webnovels, I highly recommend sticking with wuxia novels and avoiding xianxia novels. Wuxia uses cultivation to tell a story while in xianxia cultivation usually is the story.

Also xianxia tends to be much more a category of stories of generic adolescent self insert power fantasies while wuxia can actually be good. Which is why xianxia mc's are almost always selfish immoral/amoral evil, but readers are told to root for them b/c the real antagonists are somehow even worse.

I should note that this isn't limited to chinese xianxia, even western litrpg's or western cultivation novels tend to have mc's that are selfish, if not selfish assholes.

--------------

Random thoughts: Not very sure if xianxia as a genre lends itself to the evil mc because of actual genre limitations, (it's very rational to be selfish in xianxia world since eternal life is an actual possibility), or if it's just that xianxia has never actually had someone write the genre well.

That said, you kinda have to be fine with the translation quality of chinese webnovels. If you've read any others in the past and found it ok then you should be fine, but if not it'll be somewhat jarring. You kinda have to go in knowing they are written and translated in a particular style. Many find the style unbearable, but if you don't mind that, it should be fine.

Oh another cultivation story I would also recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293.][Ave Xia Rem Y]].

*** The problem with cultivation novels is that a lot of the best in the genre are parodies of the crap you find in the rest of the genre. Stuff like 'Cultivation Chat Group,' 'Ascending, Do Not Disturb,' or to a lesser extent 40 Millenniums (this one is more it's own thing than a parody like those other two) can be funny, but you're better off going into them with an understanding of what to expect normally.

In my opinion, the best example of a 'typical cultivation novel' that isn't too badly written is 'I Shall Seal the Heavens.' It has all the standard tropes, almost everything is played straight, and the translation is decent with footnotes to explain many cultural references. This isn't one of the western interpretations or designated gateway novels, but it's understandable enough that a western reader can pick everything up pretty quick.

I haven't read it myself (couldn't get into it), but 'Coiling Dragon' is frequently recommended as a gateway series because it's written like a western fantasy with a XianXia-themed coat of paint.

Both of the series are completely translated on Wuxiaworld, though you might want to read in incognito mode because the website has a free-chapter limit that you can ignore by closing/reopening an incognito window.

For easy reading, choose /Cradle/. The author is American and the stories blend cultivation tropes with more familiar epic fantasy tropes.

For humor, epic power advancement, crazy scams and bold protagonists, choose /I Shall Seal The Heavens/. The story has some silly and crude moments. But overall, the scope is epic, the action is continual without being exhausting, and the core story is huge and sincere.

For a world of wonder and awe, a smart plot and a thoughtful main character, choose /Lord of the Mysteries/. The author was influenced by Lovecraft and goes for a truly grand and mysterious backstory, with a hero who focuses their rise to power not on fighting, but on figuring out secrets and plotting survival.

**** The first book of Cradle is also extremely meh. It's my understanding the author wrote it fast, was surprised it sold, and then started putting effort into the sequels. So on the one hand Cradle gets a lot better, but on the other hand, the first few books have a very whiny protagonist who is on the weak side. I really don't understand why people like Cradle as much as they do, but then again, I tried about 200 translated Chinese and Korean cultivation novels before I read it and the flaws just jump out at me. I'm not really up for a discussion of specifics since I stopped/dropped Cradle after finishing book six (when book six was the latest book) and I barely remember the series other than not thinking much of the protagonist (his catchphrase is the word 'apologies' and is overused). I plan to give it another go if the author ever finishes the series as people keep talking it up. My impression does not match its hype.

I'd rec 40 millennia above Cradle. Forge of Destiny is above average for a cultivation story, but stylistically "The Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality" and "Ze Tan Ji" do what it does, but better. Also I believe both of them are completely translated while Forge is still ongoing.

***** MC is cradle is polite which is rational. He prepares and plans for fights. He builds tools, weapons and armor to increase his chances of victory. There's a particular fight he just pulls out a magic bazooka and wins against a person that's likely stronger and better equipped / funded.

MC has to train and advance normally without exploits, bs ancestral master or returner knowledge..

The worldbuilding fixes a lot of plotholes other stories in the genre have. People are respectable. Beating weaker people is extremely frowned upon. Having a disciple fight a weaker person dishonors his masters.

People are powerful but to reasonable levels, they are still human, physics still apply. The cultivation system is good and well made. The pacing is great.

The book one is ok though, it's miles ahead of most cultivation stories. There's a hook, a plot that's not cliche school, mean young masters, infinite money exploit or found an ancient treasure / master that makes him OP..

I tried forty-millenniums-of-cultivation but did not like it.

I read a bit of Lord of Mysteries and it seemed promising.

"The Warlock of the Magus World" is also pretty good, and has very rational characters (the MC is probably the most rational character I have ever read). I skimmed a lot of it though, especially as the author has a habit of repeating information. The story also has the near-fatal problem that while the author pays lip service to risks (e.g., saying the chance for some plan's success is 70 percent), almost everything goes the MC's way. Another big problem is that with a self-centered, rational MC, we aren't that invested in other characters. Together, these significantly lessen the tension.

*** I'd highly recommend Fantasy High - it's a little more comedy-focused Practical Guide or Worth the Candle, but as the narrative unfolds it becomes clear that Brennan Lee Mulligan (the DM) has created a really fascinating, richly-detailed world with a plot that ties together so many narrative threads. Whilst there's a combat encounter every other episode in the first season, I think the players are sufficiently skilled at unique and innovative solutions - and keeping the comedy going - that I didn't get bored watching those.

It also has a really great emotional rationality, if that makes sense? Some characters (well, some NPCs) will come out with engaging, meaningful emotional responses and advice that, honestly, I feel is very applicable to real life situations.

The story itself is set in a world that, except for the country the main characters live in, is fairly standard DnD fare. The action of the first season is set in Elmville, which is a sort of a modernised DnD world - cars exist, but they run on elementals, there's a genie who runs an ice-cream shop, and the main characters are all students that attend the Aguefort Adventuring Academy, a high school that essentially trains adventurers.

It's also very aware of a lot of DnD cliches, and I think avoids them or runs headlong into them in hilarious and interesting ways. For example, the Principal is very clear in the welcome speech that, yes, they are essentially training the students to become murderhobos - "and what a noble, dignified profession that is!"

Tl;dr, Fantasy High is a comedy DnD podcast in a modern setting with two seasons, the first one fully on youtube, the second one mostly on Dropout (a streaming service that you can do a three-day free trial run of).

I listened to ~150 hours of it back when I had a commute, but the same properties that made it such a good commute listen make it a terrible sitting-at-home-looking-for-dense-novelty experience - it's not edited, each episode sprawls, and it's pretty standard save-the-world fare. Once players started checking how their spells worked before the livestream, that helped with the sprawl, but it still drags just a little bit too much for this brain to keep attention - especially when I'm mostly watching for clever and original spins on classic fantasy, not the voice acting/improv comedy/singing. And they regularly pull out a battleaxe to solve the problem. It's just not for me.

Fantasy High, by contrast, has none of these problems - it's obsessively edited, the cast isn't constantly interrupting the game to sell you merch or sing a limerick, and Brennan is an absolute font of originality and humor.

Most people on this subreddit would probably agree that Factorio appeals to them. Well, take the main addictive thing about Factorio---the endless possibilities for tweaking and optimization---and apply it to a rogue-lite. Unlike any rogue-lite I've played, here it's very easy to force any build you want (especially after a few between-run upgrades, but even before that), and instead of "just one fix to the advanced circuits production line," it's "just one fix to my 'shield that burns enemies in the radius of the whole screen because who needs shooting in a space shooter' build."

And the variety of viable builds here is staggering. Almost anything can be hilariously broken if you survive long enough and choose the upgrades just right, so the endless tweaking is always justified.

They're pretty consistent and slow to change their opinion, though, so you can squint a bit and make generalisations, and you'll be able to make out general rules. Note that none of the main characters Wildbow has written are particularly rational characters. Blake trusts his gut more than any fancy logic and calculation, and the trio from Pale are thirteen.

Another one where exploration of the world's real foundations is discouraged would be [[https://katalepsis.net/][Katalepsis]].

*** I've been dabbling around in cultivation novels, and I feel there's only 3 worth reading.

Cradle, as mentioned by another commenter, is probably the best and highest quality of them, written and published by a professional author, although it does play the cultivation genre pretty straight. Excellent western take, and the payoff and progression is amazing, especially when it culminates in awesome volumes like Ghostwater or Wintersteel. Often considered one of the best progression fantasy novels too.

Forge of Destiny on RoyalRoad. Follows a commoner girl joining a sect and studying her way up. The setting is relatively straightforward for cultivation, but it does some cool stuff I rarely see in cultivation that I greatly appreciate. Cultivation novels basically never focus on school arcs, and FoD so far is only in school, and has a lot of focus on character development and writing. You see a lot of the other sect students and they get a lot of development, which cultivation novels basically never do. The MC also specializes in musical arts. She even attaches herself to a lord as a vassal and is going to try to help her in her goals. It doesn't do anything unique in the setting, but it's approach and focus makes Forge of Destiny a unique cultivation novel and one of the best.

And finally, Forty Milleniums of Cultivation. The only actual Chinese novel among the three, and the only one that doesn't play the genre straight. Preliminary warning, but this is a translated Chinese webnovel, so the writing quality may be a bit...bad and unbearable, if you're not of the crowd used to reading translated webnovels.

It takes a lot of the setting from Warhammer 40K, but really only that and makes its own amazing story. It combines high tech and cultivation, and instead of grimdark the novel is more about the glory and brilliance of humanity and protecting the common people instead of abusing and taking advantage of them.

This series relies the most on your understanding of typical cultivation tropes as it deconstructs the typical themes and tropes and goes against it, and is pretty much the only Chinese cultivation novel in its stance. The starting 200-300 chapters can be a bit generic, although there are still a lot of great moments, and from there on it's just constantly amazing.

It does a lot of cool and unique things. Starting with high tech cultivation, it's also the only cultivation novel that's about protecting the common people, and there's also a lot of philosophical debates and genuinely interesting and competent villains.

Among all cultivation novels, even Western ones like Cradle and Forge of Destiny, I'd say it's the most rational of them. It's hard to describe and do the novel justice as I feel my words are poor and insufficient, but for those savvy in cultivation and it's tropes, FMoC is phenomenal and unique. Definitely worth reading, if translated web novels don't bother you.

I'd recommend Cradle over the others in terms of writing quality and ease of accessibility, but if you're going further into the cultivation rabbit hole these other 2 are definitely worth checking out.

**** Forge is a little weird in that it was originally a quest that was edited into a story. Parts of it do not translate well, and that's why you end up seeing the character go on missions you never saw the description of, or make decisions about what to do next that seemingly come out of nowhere. Without the constant chatter of the quest threads and the author's presented options / out of character explanations it can be hard to really get a handle on the narrative and it can feel like a slog, especially when the character seems to plateau in power. You don't get to see the training options being picked over and over to try and reach the end of this level's experience bar.

**** I've found [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/infinite-realm-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends]] to be worth the read too, although it's more a mashup of cultivation, litrpg esque classes, and Skill training (in the vein of those anime where someone reaches enough understanding of a skill and transcends reality). The system and worldbuilding are actually very well done, and most of the main characters seem smart enough and competent enough. The author has done a good thing and made the main characters special but not /too/ special. People exist with even more talent and power than them. I'd say some of the characterizations comes off a bit stiff at first, but the author has quickly improved in that, and recent chapters have been really good in terms of characterization.

Rational-adjacent. Most of the reasons sects and guild work make sense. People get more mentally influenced as they get more powerful (they start to embody their power more than themselves), so the system in place is something that just barely works for the current state of civilization. All the powers are balanced, and balanced well. And nobody at the top are schmucks.

** I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38100/meet-the-freak][Meet the Freak]]. It has an eight feet tall Canadian guy as the protagonist, getting isekai'd to another world. But within the first chapter it turns out that pretty much all the residents around him are also from other worlds. Some getting isekai'd a few days ago, and some getting isekai'd a decade past. The setting is also pretty unique, with most people living in mountaintops since it floods every week up to a certain elevation. Overall, I've got conflicted feelings though.

The story has some really good munchkining, with a highly munchkin-able magic system. The protagonist is pretty knowledgeable and shows it. The characters are also pretty smart overall and usually act the way you'd expect real people to act (a bit too much sass in my opinion though). What I don't like though are the harem vibes. The author said he won't be making one, but with each new "main" character being female and getting saved by the protagonist it kinda feels like the setup to one of those trashy harem litrpgs on KU. Some of the decisions also feel inconsistent morally, but I can't really put to words what. Overall, if you really want some munchkining and aren't too discerning about anything else I'd say give it a try.

I also started HPMOR again. Does Harry get more bearable and less snobby than he is in the beginning? He acts like every one of those iamverysmart guys I've met in school over my life and it's very annoying. It's like he's more a walking font of Wikipedia articles than any substantive character, and it's quickly making me sour towards the story.

You know how Phil Connors becomes a better person in /Groundhog Day/, but his character development is the core plot arc of the movie?

HJPEV is a lot like that. He does get much better by the end of the story (at least IMHO), but if you find him insufferable such that you're just sitting around waiting for him to pull his head out of his ass, then you likely won't enjoy an entire 650k word epic about his character arc.

***** A small snip of our yesterday's session:

/Narrator (me): Crazy Bed (my older son's PC) and Mini Monkey (my younger's PC) are stranded on an island. They are hungry, and want something to eat. But the only two things to eat are bananas (Monkey's favourite) and spinach (Bed's favourite)/

/Narrator (me): What should MiniMonkey and Crazy Bed eat for dinner? Maybe they should mix spinach with bananas!/

/Monkey: no, spinach is eek! Only bananas!/

/Crazy Bed: No, spinach is yummy/

/Narrator: Well, Crazy Bed is older, and says spinach is yummy, so it means spinach is not eek. (Appeal to authority)./

/Mini Monkey: maybe Crazy Bed thinks wrong? (scepticism)/

/Narrator: Why? Why do you think He is wrong? (Maieutics)/

/Mini Monkey: Maybe spinach is yummy only in his mouth? I like ONLY bananas./

/Narrator: How do you know? Maybe we mix bananas with spinach and find out?/

/Both: NOO !! Noo!/

/Narrator: but I think this is the only way! Either you both eat bananas mixed with spinach, or nothing at all! (False alternative)/

/Crazy Bed: nooo we can eat our favourite things. Me spinach, and Monkey eats banana./

/narrator: Ok, Monkey and the Bed, both get their favourite food. But also, there appears a pie made of spinach and bananas, mixed. Do you want to try?/

/Monkey: noo! yuck/

/Crazy Bed: maybe..can we get Nutella on it?/

/Narrator: a magical jar of Nutella appears. It promises to give you a spoon of Nutella each straight to your mouth. OR, you can chose to eat the weird spinach-banana pie and then each get TWO spoons of Nutella on it. What do you chose? Is it better to take a small spoon of yummy Nutella, or risk eating a weird pie to get TWO spoons? (Weighting options)/

/Monkey: I want one spoon with no Nutella ./

/Crazy Bed: I want a whole jar of Nutella and then I even eat the whole pie!/

/Monkey: Oh yes, mee too!/

/Narrator: the Magical Jar of Nutella says to you: Each of you must hide behind a tree, and eat half of the weird pie. If You both eat, you get a whole jar of me. If both of you cheat and not eat, you get no Nutella. If only one of you cheats, the cheater gets a whole jar of Nutella, and the not-cheater gets nothing. What do you do?? (this took several minutes to explain to them, because they wanted to lawyer their way out of it, but after a while we established a proper Nutella Dilemma)......./

​

After our story was over for the day, I asked them questions about it, and encouraged them to explain to me what choices they made were "good thinking" and which were "weak thinking" (logical mistakes).

By now, the older ingrained some basic avoidance of the most common fallacies, at leas the ones that can be explained to a 4 year old. The younger simply became a sceptic: he loudly complains if a cartoon character or a book character does something irrational.\\
As a weird side -effect, they both developed strong aversion to lying, and are angered by being lied to. Not sure if this is good or bad yet.

  I understand conflict driver
#+end_quote

The conflict drive is one part of the problem, but the other part is that "Tinkertech" is not regular technology and can't be used in large scale projects. Without regular maintenance done by the Tinker, Tinkertech falls apart. Here is what the /Worm/ canon says about this problem:

#+begin_quote
  [Lily:] I'd have to give up my arbalest.  Without tinker maintenance, it won't keep working

  [Defiant:] I will maintain two of these packs for you, and you can switch to the spare if one needs repairing or recharging.  Some of it's of Dragon's design, but the maintenance will be left to me. 
#+end_quote

The only two Tinkers who can partially get around this limitation are Dragon and Masamune and that's what they concentrate on:

#+begin_quote
  Masamune wasn't present, but from what I knew of the guy, he wasn't even close to being a front-lines combatant.   They'd recruited him from the ruined area of Japan, a somewhat crazed hermit, and gave him work in figuring out how to mass produce their stuff without the maintenance issues snowballing out of control, like tinker tech tended to do in large quantities.
#+end_quote

That said, there are quite a few Worm fics in which the apparent "Tinker" power is actually something else, which lets the characters get around normal Tinkertech limitations. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10230499/36/Memories-of-Iron][Memories of Iron]] is probably the best known example.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: for people who might say "write your own." I'm trying but 3k words does not a story make. Writing is genuinely hard.
#+end_quote

This is kinda what it boils down to. Writing is hard enough, and when you put the added requirement of having things semi make sense, the burden of research, crosschecking, note-taking, and so on that you have to do even for things that may not make it into the story gets a lot higher. Doing a full "tinker uplift" story which actually remains interesting as a story in addition to being sensible is something you'd probably do as a 3rd or later major project, rather than your first or second. This is especially the case since Worm is set in a modern setting, where aspects of the real world could make a pretty big difference.

Plus, you have to think about it from the perspective of someone who wants to write fanfiction. Most of the time, the motivation is going to come down to either annoyance with some aspect of canon that they want to change, or just to experience more of the canon world by changing things in ways that personally appeal.

And the second plus is that it's not even unrealistic. Most people don't automatically think about the ways they could be the most effective from first principles, instead just kind of reacting to the situation they're in. Like, you take 10,000 hypothetical people at random into a situation where they have a power which drives them towards parahuman conflict, there is a whole institution which actively supports this conflict and suppresses efforts to work outside it, where trying to do anything independently is very likely to get them captured by someone who will force them to participate in parahuman conflict, and what are the results going to be? Very likely literally 0 out of those 10,000 will make any especial effort towards maximising positive impact, and even if they do they aren't likely to be very successful unless they have a long lead up time. Which they don't have if they enter the Worm universe at the time of Taylor's trigger - the world literally ends in a few years. Changing the world from within the Protectorate just isn't going to happen - it's a government institution. Change only happens on a scale of decades.

So you're essentially forced to go full villain, but where do you get your resources? You almost need to start a billionaire to even have a chance. And then not only that, you have Simurgh, Mannequin+S9 who will actively seek to remove anyone too effective, and Contessa will stop you from improving the world too much that the rate of new parahumans would decrease.

Of course, all this goes out the window if the power is OP enough, but barring that you're talking Elon Musk level effectiveness and motivation as a lower bound. Or a large amount of patience and luck to survive Gold Morning and be in a position to improve things after that.

Yeah it's an infinitely scaling tinker, but I feel like the author does a good job of showing people's character flaws and strengths. The protagonist /does/ want to do good by humanity, but he's sorta forced into the villain route to keep his abilities secret and scaling.

It does focus a lot on the tinker powers though, which slows the story down a lot. Thankfully, the author is a freak and writes like 20k words every week.
