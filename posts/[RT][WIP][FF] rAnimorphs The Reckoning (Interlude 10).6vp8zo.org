** Brief and disconnected from the plot as it was, I love these meta-inspired chapters a lot; they make the world feel more lived-in and expands it past our imagination's first pass.

Also appreciated the cameo of sorts, though I'm curious to know what inspired its inclusion: it matched my attitude pretty well despite me not explicitly saying anything on the topic before :)

** I saw the thread about this one, but it's really improved here by cutting out so many of the comments. I like this presentation of the material quite a lot, and I think I saw things that I missed last time. I think I was frustrated with the direction of some of the comments there. Thanks for cleaning it up and posting it. I like that this kind of meta-fic can become part of the story.

Also, I wouldn't feel too guilty about the update schedule. Life happens, and I know plenty of fics with much worse update schedules. Mine, for example.

That said, I am looking forward to the next chapter.

But yeah, a lot of the information in this is pretty important. On the other hand, it's nothing the Animorphs haven't likely shared yet with American intel services. This is more of a second opinion, distributed more directly.

** I wasn't too keen on this chapter. I think that there was a missed opportunity for including fictional-reddit's reaction to Starrat's assumed death, be it sympathetic towards Starrat's desire to have some of his experiences live on, or vindictive ex 'fucking slug, glad you're dead, hope you're okay Alexandre' or even at the most basic level 'RIP OP'. Personally, I've always been fascinated by humanity's capacity for empathy and hostility, and I'd've liked to see more of that from fictional-reddit. Also missed opportunity for a cameo of 'FREE OR DEAD'.

I feel like there's a similar issue here to the other reddit interlude - a lot of debate, and much less reactions/emotion (I did like ControlGroup9's comment, that was awesome). I remember there being comments in previous threads about the Animorphs in this universe seeming way older due to their rationality, which is fine if you're talking about a group handpicked by E/C. However, I don't think the rest of the world would react so calmly to an alien invader going 'yo reddit I'm an alien that's part of the group responsible for massacring a major city, AMA'. Overall the feel of the interlude to me was a bit too much 'How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?'

I got to the AMA thread a little too late - it had already closed, but I'm happy to go back and make contributions if [[/u/CouteauBleu]] is willing to reopen it :P Or hell, I'd be happy to write a vindictive/angry reaction to Starrat's death if you want to bring TroubledTrousers back, haha!

*** I'm currently at my grandparent's and internet connection is limited (also we're supposed to enjoy nature and stuff), so progress is going to be slow. But yeah, I'm in the middle of a pretty major rewrite. I'll PM you details.

I agree that the interlude lacks emotion, both from Starrat and the redditors. On one hand, I can sort of justify this as Starrat being very stoic and only answering level-headed questions, and filtering out streams of insult. But yeah, that's pretty thin. And there's a lot of cold-headed discussion of slavery, genocide, etc, and it could use more anger.

I'd absolutely like a vindictive/angry reaction from TroubledTrousers, as long as it's at least vaguely a question and not just a rant (I need to be able to answer it and engage what you say)

On the other hand, the interlude is already pretty packed. A lot of questions were asked, and I don't want to add too much; I don't want to skip existing questions either, since they're all great; I might merge some, and edit them to add more bile. I'll definitely add a "FREE OR DEAD" cameo now that you mention it.

I kind of want to leave it ambiguous what happens to the character. Kind of a "this is the journal's last entry" thing, where we presume that the guy just died.

** So when Starrat 731 mentions multiple hosts here :

"The game theory and sociology bits are mostly from Alexandre and my other hosts. The philosophy and future predictions are me."

And when they respond "No and no. " to "Have you ever been in other species? Or in other people besides Alexandre?"

Along with going into the differences between different species of host and different hosts within a species, that they're drawing on shared knowledge of other hosts from the Coalescence of Starrat?

** At first I didn't think I was going to like this chapter: on the surface it seemed to be about a character we've never met before, who is unwilling to talk about the main conflict, and is now likely dead. I thought it seemed a little disconnected.

But it actually turned out to be pretty fascinating.

Watching Starrat 731 dance around topics that we the readers are informed about, while the in-universe readers try to piece things together was great. There was a lot of information buried in there that only makes sense with our outside knowledge, and trying to puzzle it out was fun, and all the implications of what the Yeerk was saying were interesting.

And the morality debates were quite good too.

** Woop woop!

I'm sure there's much that I didn't pick up on, but a thing I did: is StrongerThànYou the username of Thàn Suoros?

Is ZombieAsInAlanis a reference to something, maybe to do with Alanis Morissette? It looks like she's done a cover of /Zombie/, but if that's what it is I still don't get it. Alexandre might have picked that username pre-infestation, but I'm guessing not.

The main line in the cover of /Zombie/ is "In your heeeaaaaaad, in your heeeaaaaaaaaaaaaad." Alexandre picked that as the username for the throwaway account. Also yeah, they referenced Alanis Morissette in canon a few times ("Note to Alanis: /that/ is ironic.").

** Clearly Starrat 731 is someone who the authorities should be working hard to capture alive, in order to subject him to the finest rapport-based interrogation techniques. He already let a ton of info slip out through his AMA and seems like a perfect candidate for revealing more to the right sort of audience.

I wonder how many of the questions (and upvotes) came from the FBI, MIB, or similar. Plausibly mine (SoccerJack's) could have, with the ducks/horses question serving as a relatively skillful "How do you do, fellow kids?" At the very least, lots of important people have been reading it very closely.

** Yay, my words are immortalized in my favorite rationalist fic!

For the record, I was in fact playing a character (or trying to) with similar views to myself, but a different personality. At the end I sort of got tired and just lazily replied with the "I don't really disagree with any of that on a factual level..." sentence.

"ControlGroup" is not the modification of my username that I would have expected, given that it refers to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group][the mathematical kind of Lie Group]], but it works just fine. (In retrospect, it may have been a bad decision to pick a username that most people will associate with lying).

The reddit post you made giving a progress update was much appreciated... though it seems you fell prey to the planning fallacy... I would have preferred regular small regular updates, like twitter updates, to a single update without a follow up. Even if it's only to say "hey, lots of CFAR stuff this week, next chapter date unknown, will tweet next wednesday with revised estimates." Now that I think about it, I would totally follow a r!Animorphs twitter account - that's much better than using this subreddit. And maybe it would be extra motivation to write!

The short version is, I don't think there's any higher reason to be altruistic. There's no God, nobody exists for a purpose, we're all gonna die, etc. I do think altruism can be rational (Glimwarden puts it well enough with Philip's character), and altruism can be motivated by core values (you want to help people for the sake of helping people), which I think will come across better in the rewrite.

So this would be, like, evil!me's outlook.

** The fact that it said "I get my sloppy typing habits from my host" is interesting, in that it suggests the Yeerk has to consciously alter aspects of the host's personality; by default they're unchanged. "I kept almost everything else the same when I moved in" seems similar.

So if, say, a bunch of death row inmates were offered the option of infestation instead of execution, there might still be a risk of reoffending.

And yet, that's not the experience of the Animorphs in construct bodies. They basically have to reinvent the host's behavior.
