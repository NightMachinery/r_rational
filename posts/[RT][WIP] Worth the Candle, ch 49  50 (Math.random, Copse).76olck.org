** /Worth the Candle/ is an action-adventure litRPG that follows a teenage boy from Kansas stuck in a fantasy realm that takes its inspiration for every tabletop game he was ever the DM for. Juniper Smith was never expecting his fifth-period English class to end up like this!

**** I've got basically no clue what people actually want in a blurb, so I thought that maybe, if you were one of the people who visited this subreddit and had seen this posted like thirty times now, pointlessly generic would do it for you where other blurbs hadn't.

My problem is that this story is calibrated for my own personal tastes, and the blurb that would get /me/ to actually read this story is something like:

#+begin_quote
  From the age of nine, Juniper Smith began filling notebooks with his worlds, at first places of fantastical imagination, but later with each as an expression of some theme or idea that had grabbed his interest. At the age of seventeen, he finds himself in Aerb, a world that appears to be an amalgamation of those many notebooks, stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world might be trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he had been back on Earth.
#+end_quote

Which isn't wholly accurate to the text/plot/character, but is /close enough/ that I don't think I'd be too upset if that was what got me in. Problem is, I don't think that blurb would work for a lot of people, especially those who /want/ a more-generic power fantasy isekai story (and I'd say that this story is also that, but that wouldn't get /me/ reading).

***** For what it's worth, I was really put off reading the story for a long time by the AO3 blurb which, yeah, made it sound like generic wish-fulfillment power fantasy to me. (I don't think I ever made it past "self-insert litRPG portal fantasy" to the joke about "my personal experience", even.) I reluctantly decided to read it once EY said it was good, because I needed something new to binge, but now I'm a total true believer.

It's, like, legitimately very good/interesting/inspiring, it offers challenges and interest and themes in a way that a lot of portal fantasy doesn't. (Especially with the hook back to the real world, but also the non-exponential growth curve, the autonomy+existential worries, the gradual addiction to levelups..) I feel like it's selling the story short to frame it as a more conventional thing, and doing so will put off people like me who love some of the less-conventional stuff you're doing with it.

IMO, the comments and upvotes speak for themselves in terms of how much the story will appeal to people reading this sub. And, again, it's a sub full of contrarians who like to see story conventions messed with and challenged, especially by meta/existential/hole-poking concerns like "does this world have a DM, and how should this alter my behavior?", "are my companions' personalities created or altered for my benefit?", and "why should having a stat for a type of magic mean you can level it up arbitrarily?", not to mention "how would smart, powerful people react to someone observably rocketing up skill ladders way faster than they should?"

Maybe you could try a blurb that mentions the standard portal-fantasy stuff but also some of the questions it leads to? (I feel like the standard bookjacket approach would be to talk a lot about Arthur, but that's a pretty slow-burning story thread. Maybe you could hint at that too, though.)

****** Same here. SI+litrpg nearly scared me off. But I think we're part of the disillusioned minority that's been disappointed one too many times. There's a large reader base that enjoys SIs or litrpgs or even wish-fulfillment fantasies that doesn't overlap much with the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community. To that end, I think a generic and exciting blurb catering to the action/adventure aspects would attract more readers overall. Low barrier to entry, with recommendations (like from EY) doing the legwork for the more choosy readers.

I've been thinking of a summary that combines the best of both worlds, but it's hard to avoid spoilers and for me, part of the story's initial appeal was the unexpected surprise of a thoughtful litrpg.

Here's one:

#+begin_quote
  Juniper Smith, teenage boy from Kansas, thought he knew the difference between fantasy and reality. He never expected the D&D campaigns he ran to matter. But it's no longer roleplay because he's been thrown into a vaguely familiar fantasy world. His life is now literally an RPG and he doesn't want to die, not least before finding out how and why he's here.

  a vaguely familiar fantasy world My taste would be for something that notes the twistiness of a lot of the vaguely similar bits, like "twistedly familiar" or something. (Because "twistedly" is totally a word, shush.) Also heightens the sense of danger a bit, hinting at "twisted" as in monstrous.

And, hrm.

** WMG:

The Emulation

- It's too /early/ for the game to tell Joon that he's in an emulated world. There has to be a twist on it. Maybe he's a non-human entity emulating a human one? Maybe a god, since Amaryllis mentioned that he did something that one had done? It's unlikely that he's a straightforward brain-in-a-jar on an Earth-like world, at least.

- How does Uther/ Arthur tie into the emulation, though? How do the other people from Earth?

- Speaking of Earth, there's no possible way that someone else from Earth (besides Uther/ Joon) hasn't ended up in Aerb. Maybe Reimer? /Of course/ the story would have that one friend who Joon had massive tensions with show up.

Exclusions

- The ability to exclude things is massively powerful, more than anything else we've seen so far. What controls the exclusions? The gods? Something bigger? Does that have any relation to his power?

- Fel Seed's description mentions himself, his spawn, and his brides. Some bizarre cross between Nilbog and Heartbreaker? But Joon's more scared of him than the rest of the world, why is that?

- Doris has about nine million bodies in an excluded area. Does she have access to artifacts that were in the area before it was excluded? If so, she might have a ton of magic that she doesn't have to share with anyone.

Companions

- Amaryllis' perfect beauty is suspicious, as is her bit about maybe having to be a love interest. The game /might/ have the first companion you meet be an impossibly beautiful love interest, but the /story/ we've had so far seems like it would have an in-universe reason. Is her beauty deliberate - does she have an artifact that makes her perfect-looking? But that implies that her look /isn't/ natural, except her relatives looking like her, so maybe it's fantasy plastic surgery or something instead of shapeshifting?

- Fenn/ Joon can't work out, because of course it can't. Relationships that start this early never last. Either neither of them can manage a lasting relationship, or Amaryllis being the obvious love interest interferes with whatever's building between them, or there's something about elves and half-elves that interferes with the relationship.

- Is the Locus' Loyalty 10 bond an ability to grow stronger with Joon? Because that might be the solution to its losing power. And what's more mysterious than a power that seems to be related to creating the world itself?

- One of the next companions has to be a meatshield - we already have a sniper/ artillery, a face/ melee fighter, a battlefield controller, a wild card, and the protagonist.

I'm so conflicted right now, on one hand I love the interactions and the relation between Fenn and Joon, not to mention how slow amaryllis is to open up but Joons line if thinking made me wonder if Joon and Fenns relationship will last. I hope they do, I hope that they'll at least try to work on it instead of shoving any problems aside or just end it as is at the first sign of trouble like what most writers do. And I pray that there won't be a plot point/cliché where the MC has to choose to save one and sacrifice the other, I think Joon would have DM'd an interesting twist to anything close to that.

Now, Joons levelling is really becoming an issue, he's like some druggy waiting for the next shot, that mild rage when he killed the horned mage and didn't level up, thinking about how this was 'his kill'.. Imagine if he lashes out at the rest of the crew when they helped him kill someone in the future. Also, is this what happened to Arthur? He got addicted to the feeling of levelling and when he realised he didn't level anymore ruling over his kingdom he went out to search for more exp?

Though he's having progressively stronger reflexive thoughts, he's trying /really hard/ to not let it affect his decisions, to the point that he was dragging his feet trying to be safe while the rest of the party wanted to push forward with the plan. It was their first deliberate large-ish scale battle though, so being afraid might have contributed a lot.

Either way, managing an addiction to something that's extremely valuable for its own sake seems really hard. I suspect he's going to have to share with his party and rely on them for sanity checks.

*** Games generally have an exponential level-experience formula and, depending on the game, quests give a hefty and often higher EXP reward. So Joon might be assuming that "grinding" kills will net him levels where it could be the difficulty curve or plot significance that determines the EXP value of each target.

That would be pretty troubling because it implies that he'll eventually /have to/ (literally, since addiction) keep seeking progressively harder challenges.

Another problem is that points rewarded for each level might be disproportionate to the increasing difficulty. To put it in perspective: how many hypothetical points would a god have in the skill of their domain? 100? 200? 1000? Or another example: Joon just killed Larkspur and gained one level - if he invested the points in PHY, he most likely still can't beat Larkspur 1v1. But maybe the points are also progressive? 5 points per level after level 10?

This explains /so/ much.

So, Larkspur wants (wanted) to acquire the Penndraig entads, either for himself or his descendants. After Amaryllis turned his marriage proposal down (because who wouldn't want to marry a blood relative?), he married the next woman in the line of inheritance, then hatched a plan to have Amaryllis killed without being obviously implicated. Which is probably how she happened to be on the plane to Risen Lands, with the Fuchsia Coterie after her. And we already know about Fireteam Blackheart, as well as everything else that happened up until now.

Also, I am really happy about the Juniper-Fenn relationship, and I'm not just talking about the, ahem, romance stuff. In fact, I like that their attraction to each other (if any) is not the primary or most important thing in their interactions.

** I'm a little confused about the way Joon thinks Larkspur uses his divination, and how the forest gets around it.

In particular, it seems like Larks should be able to precommit to fighting, then query the oracle to see if he's likely to end up in the post-battle success indicator location. I'm not really sure how the bit about sending others factors into it - surely he could just plan to go to a given location after winning the battle, and P(he doesn't end up there) basically equals P(he lost)?

And if so, I don't see how the forest ambush factored in. Using the cards meant the probability was very spread out, but then they had to wait until there was high probability density of them being in a single location, which presumably means the resultant spread of outcomes wouldn't be significantly wider than if he'd attacked them in town.

If I'm understanding this correctly, either Larkspur had a high chance to win but Joon got lucky, or he was desperate enough that this looked like the best chance he would get. There doesn't seem to be a way that the ambush setup could deceive his probability-querying regarding his odds of success.

#+end_quote

If he plans to query the oracle first and only go in if the odds of success exceed a certain threshold, he isn't actually precommitting to fighting.

What we don't know here is if in the "alternative presents" the oracle's power still work.

If it doesn't, then when alternate-Larks asks alternate-Doris "is my attack going to be a success" she tells him "that's weird, my tracking powers just stopped working". Then I guess he goes in, because he knows he is a simulated reality so he uses it to gain intel for his real self?

The self-tracking strategy would work unconditionally in this case, all it would take is enough time between precommitment and action for enough alternate-selves with this particular precommitment to build up to get a useful probability reading. For example, if 20% of alternative-presents split from reality within the last hour, then Larks could plan for his alternative-selves to attack in an hour, then 30 minutes take a reading of the probability of his alternative-selves being at the "success signal" location. Multiplying the probability by 5 (since only 20% of alternate-selves were attacking) would give him the real probability of success. It also follows that the real attack would be delayed, because he needs to wait for the alternate-selves to finish the battle and send the success signal.

The problem with this particular scenario is that some simulation inhabitants would be able to learn they are in a simulation (as Larks does, in this example). We could posit that the simulation alters people's psychology to prevent them from noticiting that, and just continute as normal despire tracking powers stopping to work (so Larks would just carry out his precommitment and not give any thought as to why he is not getting any more tracking data from Doris). Either way, it seems inelegant to me and if I were the DM I would not go for that option.

Which brings us to the second possibility, that the oracle's powers work in the alternate-presents as well. This seems to be what Juniper is assuming.

In this case, if Larks only goes in if he gets the success-signal, then none of alternative-selves will go in because they are waiting for the success-signal as well. Hence the coin strategy - some of the alternate selves need to attack unconditionally in order for Larks to get a useful probability reading on whether the attack is a success. Which means Larks needs to precommit to some probability of himself attacking unconditionally (50%, with the coin strategy), because his only way of affecting the actions and decisions of his alternate-selves is through his own actions and decisions.

Anyway, a lot of Juniper's thinking and planning here is based on assumptions and incomplete data (which I like, because that's often how the real world works). It seems to me his implied assumption is that even if Larks can use self-tracking strategy to glean information on whether his plans are successful, there is some non-trivial cost to doing so (time, at least. and possibly payment for additional use of Doris' services). So Larkspur's initial assumptions and beliefs about the situation *do* matter, and making the situation look less like a trap is a good thing. And the whole thing is probabilistic in nature, so maybe Larks has a bad flip of the coin and goes in anyway. And if he does learn that he would fail, all that means he doesn't show up - all that costs Juniper's party is time. Or maybe if he learns he would fail he instead shows up with (what he thinks is) an overwhelming force, which is might as well what could have happened here.

** I just finished binge reading this entire story, and wanted to comment both to thank you for the excellent read as well as to offer a few points of constructive criticism that caught my attention while I enjoyed your work.

First, I found myself on several occasions feeling like the barbed jokes and vicious sarcasm being thrown between party members came across as much more literal than I think was intended. Until I grew more used to it, I was somewhat confused why they all seemed to keep "fighting" with each other. Because so much of the relationship building is based in these comments, perhaps some clarification of body language or tone of voice would make the fact that these are jokes and prodding and not vicious attacks more clear.

Secondly, dispite the meta theme of whether or not Juniper's thought patterns are being totally screwed with by the "DM" and his efforts to think about and look for those changes, he failed to notice that he went from his first kill to finishing off the mortally wounded in a span of around a month and a half or so. This seems like something that he should have caught on to. Similarly, his ability to ignore pain and continue to function is significantly above human norms and seems like something that would be noticed as external influence. These can both be waived aside as the "DM" could certainly prevent him from noticing those things, but given that several other potential existential crises were able to be discovered, I am unsure why these were not.

Lastly, while they are certainly relevant to the story, the fact that all of the interludes of Juniper's time on Earth are related directly to playing D and D seems like it puts a bit of a limit on the potential character development for him. Allowing readers to see him in other contexts than playing a game or living one can help shed light on his interactions with his companions. Interludes with the companion's points of view would also be great for the same reason, but I also understand that they would kind of ruin the subplot regarding whether or not they are even real people.

Thank you again for this excellent story, and I will check back in regularly to read new chapters!

** Started the story this week, and just read up to this point. I'm really loving the druidic allusions to Seeing Like a State, & its SSC review!
