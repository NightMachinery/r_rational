** I think that fan-fic authors going full on conspiracy theory on things like Dumbledore and other elements of canon can still be fine, as long as they accept that their story is now an AU, and so decide to focus on world-building instead of character bashing. After all, the whole point of fan-fiction is changing canon in some minute (or major) ways, and then seeing how the story flows from their.

Take HPMOR for example - many of the people I've seen hating on the story online abandoned it because they felt like it was character bashing; like some characters, specifically Dumbledore, had been changed simply to make rational!Harry look better. And yet the story is amazing, because even though there is a conspiracy theory at work behind the scenes, the author commits to it; he writes the story in such a way that it can be believed that the character of Dumbledore, as he is portrayed, would act like he does. In sum, the author created a slightly different version of Dumbledore, and then (not really, but practically) built a world around him that explained the character, instead of just using him as bash fodder. The same can be said of HPMOR Voldemort, when you actually look at his backstory - the author had a vision of who he wanted Voldemort to be, and instead of just changing the character for no reason, he changed Voldemort's backstory in ways that more than justified the change. He made, in a way, the conspiracy theory rational. Voldemort and Dumbledore had to be different, and so the entire Wizarding World was changed around them accommodate this, providing the reader with not only interesting new characters, but also an interesting 'new' setting to explore and theorize about.

A story that I think had the potential to do this, but didn't quite get it right, was a Well Groomed Mind. I have a soft spot for any fic that actually explores what the consequences of mind magic, as it's shown in the Wizarding World, could be. And it starts off pretty strong; it asks the question "how did Harry grow up, essentially, an abused little boy, and then go to Hogwarts only to quickly lose all the traits that usually characterize abuse and become a textbook hero instead?" And then thinks a bit, and then provides an answer that seems vaguely possibly in canon, and interesting "Dumbledore is using mind magic".

And then it goes nowhere with that idea. Good world-building in fanfics, in my opinion, should be based around the most important changes the fic has made to canon. A Well Groomed Mind makes a very important change (Dumbledore is now an evil mental manipulator who tried to inflict personality death on Harry), and then spends most of its first few chapters on world-building that doesn't justify the change. Dumbledore being evil now is just taken as a fact, and while the fic does spend a lot of time fleshing out a system of mind magic I vaguely remember as being much more detailed than canon, is doesn't spend half as much time justifying the change. I got pretty far in the fic, and in all my reading it didn't give a reason for why Dumbledore became the way he is, or how the Wizarding World that could produce this Dumbledore was different in new, and interesting ways. The Headmaster of Hogwarts was using mind magic to control his students, and yet the rest of Wizarding Britain, where the majority of the story takes place, was basically the same. Instead most of the world-building time was spent explaining how the rest of the magical world was different, and Britain was weird, which is good and all; only the story takes place in Britain, and so that came off as a lot of telling and very little showing.

TLDR: Basically, I think reinterpreting certain key elements in canon, and engaging in some 'conspiracy think' can lead to some very interesting fics, and can be rational, if the author uses that reinterpretation as a springboard for world-building, rather than character bashing.

*** I don't remember if I let that caveat in, but I think I did mention that /intentional/ paranoia can work in the author's favor. One of my favorite examples of this is /Steins;Gate/, where the main character's delusions are all part of an elaborate inside joke with his friends. But almost seamlessly, those delusions are brought into reality. The emotional crux of the show is the contrast between how he deals with his fantasy versus reality, and how he resolves that inconsistency by staying true to himself.

I'd contest that HPMOR has /Dumbledore/ bashing, though. He kind of does becomes the resolution to the entire plot in an epic chain of prophesized events leading to his own demise. Harry and Dumbledore have their disagreements, but throughout all of them, there's this persistent feeling that Harry is /missing/ the final clue to Dumbledore's behavior. And, for what it's worth, Dumbledore is never overtly mean. The closest thing to bashing I can recall is Harry resolving Snape's bullying with blackmail. I'm /pretty sure/ this had some kind of elaborate purpose, like convincing Harry that Dumbledore thinks entirely in narrativism or something, but I can't really identify what off the top of my head.

**** oh yeah I'm not saying that I agree with the idea that HPMOR has Dumbledore bashing, just that when I see people on the internet argue about whether its a good fic or not, I often see HPMOR haters saying that it bashes Dumbledore and other authority figures. Anyways, I don't quite think Steins Gate is the best example of what I'm trying to say, as it is something that only really works in the context of fanfiction. Essentially, while I agree with all of your points, I do think that 'reinterpreting' parts of a canon work in weird, conspiracy-esque ways can turn out rational, if that conspiracy is then actually included into the world-building, and not just used to kickstart the plot.

Like how in HPMOR, Dumbledore's weird behavior wasn't just something the author threw in for no reason; it was actually a major part of the plot, and was brought on and justified by major changes to the world around him, making it feel less like it was the author just changing Dumbledore for no reason, and more like the author was writing the true, canon version of Dumbledore, if Dumbledore had been raised in the strange new world the author had created, instead of the canon Wizarding World.

That one, key difference, I think, is where most people draw the line between a character being a thinly veiled OC, and a character actually being themselves; if the world around them justifies their changed personality. And I think the same thing can be applied to conspiracy reinterpretations; they can be rational, if the world around them justifies their existence. A rational fic author totally could write Dumbledore as a manipulative dude who left Harry with the Dursleys just to make him impressionable and desperate for attention, like a lot of fanfic authors do; they're just going to have to do a lot of work explaining what changed in the Wizarding World to turn Dumbledore, of all people, into the kind of guy who would do that (and that's the step most fanfic authors skip; the actual, difficult world building).

*** I think that "deeply sick" would be a good way to describe wizarding society if it wasn't a clear satirization of real life. To be perfectly clear, the following were all exaggerated in the story for the sake of humor:

- The entire Ministry, including Fudge.
- The Ministry's intervention in Hogwarts in year 5.
- The Dursley's behavior and obsession with "normality".
- Malfoy (minor) and his relationship to Malfoy (greater).
- The house-elves and later Lockhart in year 2.
- Love potions and the other date-rapey stuff in year 6.
- Ron and Hermione's pig-headedness in year 4 (and basically all of the awkward puberty stuff in that year).
- Even more stuff I can't keep track of.

Just about the only thing that wasn't played for comedy was Voldemort himself. I understand that these things are /sometimes/ used as actual sources of drama, or that the humor in these things is expressed in British and therefore unintelligible to an American audience, but treating them as serious is seriously tone-deaf.

The Dursleys exist because Rowling thought they were funny and because a rags-to-riches story is more fun than a riches-to-riches story. Any theory that calls Dumbledore evil because of that is invalid. Dumbledore bringing Harry into the fold to fight Voldemort isn't evil because Harry wants to help out of the goodness of his heart. Any theory that calls Dumbledore evil because of that has to /first/ prove that Harry was somehow coerced into fighting by Dumbledore. The same cannot be said for the opposite - keeping Harry out of the loop for so long because of his lack of occlumency was a smart decision, but not a nice one. This is what makes him a morally conflicted protagonist (aside from his history with Grindelwald and his sister).

Don't get me wrong. The resulting story from this half-parody half-serious format is hardly rational. It relies on comedic convenience for one half and then regular old narrative convenience for the other. But in the end, people liked it. If that means we have to go through an extra amount of effort to read the story as it was intended, then so be it.

**** While that's a great Doylist explanation of why Wizarding Britain is deeply sick, it doesn't make it not actually deeply sick.

Basically, HP is a crackfic.

So, unless you're writing an equally crack fanfic about it, or you're writing a fixfic AU, you're going to run smack dab into this in-your-face Fridge Horror. Treating Dumbledore's fuckups seriously isn't AU, it's quite the opposite. You can make him (possibly accidentally) evil, incompetent, or overworked to the point he's dropping plates in public. But Rowling's presentation of him as a benevolent genius just doesn't fly in a "straight" fanfic.

***** A story is made of more than its plot. Tone is communicated through the aggregate connotation of all of the words related to a specific context, and most readers are sensitive to it. Writing a story where the fridge horror pokes through the cracks is tonally different from a story that plays the story elements the same way Rowling does. So, in the same way that there is a canon /plot/, there is also a canon /attitude/.

Sticking to the canon attitude is boring the same way sticking to the canon plot is boring. But disregarding its existence has a chance to lead to bad writing.

Consider bashing. The reason Ron Weasley isn't a compelling villain in the stories that vilify him is because his attitudinal position in the story meant that his plot position wasn't suitable for a villain - in canon, Ron is a poor underdog without any money or talent. It's often even worse than that, the way fanfiction authors do it, where he lacks even the support of his family. Whatever happened to "If you give Frodo a lightsaber you must give Sauron the Death Star."? If Ron is your villain then they're doing a very bad job of making him compellingly antagonizing.

You can apply the same logic to Dumbledore. Sure, the fridge horror of being left at the Dursleys can be extrapolated from canon. But if you're taking /that/ from canon, surely you have to take into account the fact that Dumbledore intervenes basically zero times in Harry's life until the end of book five. He likes to keep Harry abused, but also only hires /one/ abusive professor? And he lets Harry sleep in an actual common room with actual friends? If he's a villain, he's not a very good one.

The problem isn't that the people who write these stories have diverged from the tonal meaning of canon. The problem is that they've disregarded that tone, and then written a story extrapolating from the worst examples of behavior for each of the selected characters. And often the way these characters are selected is arbitrary - Draco Malfoy's personality will be rebuilt around his best moments. On occasion, so will Snape's.

For me, Rowling wrote a story where the fridge horror slaps you in the face. Not as badly as, say, the typical romcom where sitting back and going "OK, this is a crack fic" doesn't reinforce the suspension of disbelief for me to sit through it, but where you're talking about the tone of Rowling's writing you're talking about the things that make it a crack fic.

#+end_quote

My logic here is more along the lines of: if you rely on canon to inform your setting but not your tone, you create villains like Dumbledore that don't make any sense. So, it's less that the /specific/ evil Dumbledore I gave is inadequate, and more that the set of evil Dumbledores that don't significantly diverge from other parts of canon are inadequate. And that's the point I was trying to make.

Any analysis of Dumbledore as evil based solely on that single plot element needs to /also/ explain away the many plot points that indicate his character is good. Like the fact that he's generally well-respected within the school, kindly, and that the only morally ambiguous thing he's done in recent memory is leaving Harry at the Dursleys. You could write a Dumbledore where those actions were all subtle manipulations and that he's actually working on his ambition, but Occam's Razor says to cut the cruft - the simpler explanation is to read the tone of the story, which tells you that the /one/ morally ambiguous event that takes place within the scope of Harry Potter is non-central to how Rowling defined his character.

If that was too complicated, here's the same thing a bit simpler:

1. Dumbledore has done one thing (within the scope of Harry Potter) that's unilaterally bad.
2. Rowling defined his character based on elements other than that one. This isn't a deduction from things she's said, it's a deduction from the attitude of the text itself.
3. As a reader, you have a choice. You could call Dumbledore evil and ignore the plot elements that show he's good. Or you could call Dumbledore good and ignore the plot elements that show he's evil. I'm presenting this as a binary because people seem to think the weight of his bad actions nullifies his good ones anyway. /Ordinarily/ this choice would be evenly weighted, or you would accept some more moderate explanation in the middle, but...
4. The evidence presented in point 2 exists, within the text. The story itself ignores the fact that he left Harry at the Dursleys when defining his character. Now, instead of it being a choice between ignoring his good actions and ignoring his bad actions, it's the difference between ignoring his good actions /and his characterization/ and ignoring his bad actions. Maybe you have a mix of both. But I don't think that when you weigh those together, Dumbledore comes out of the equation as /evil/.

To anticipate the obvious objection: no, I'm not saying /literally ignore/ the fact that Harry was left at the Dursleys. What I'm saying is that when it comes down to it, the choice that preserves canon the most is the choice that paints Dumbledore in a light that makes sense in the context of the story's attitude toward him. The first few books are /children's stories/, not game-of-thrones style dramas. Analyzing their characters and motivations from a literal-minded perspective is going to return something unrecognizeable, because the truth is that those books are /not rigorously plotted enough to be held to those standards/.

Let's say you're watching that Sandra Bullock vehicle where she's marooned in the space station, and I walk into the room and stand there behind the couch watching it with you, and they get to the scene where Sandra and her space-buddy are holding into the the basically intact and airtight space station and the guy lets go.

And instead of just floating there, maybe drifting away a bit until she can tug on his rope and pull him back, he gets hurled off into space.

I roll my eyes and walk out because that's just too stupid to keep watching. Because if the station was spinning fast enough that happens the thing would be an uninhabitable wreck, with modules and solar panels stripped off, because it's not built to handle that kind of stress.

Yes, ordinary stories do that kind of shit all the time, /and that's a problem/.

It's not "I'm spoiled by [[/r/rational]]", it's that /literally the only reason I'm here/ is because, despite the LessWrong shenanigans, this is one of the few places where whopping plot holes like that attract the kind of derision they deserve.

** > The idea of making a protagonist an antagonist is an interesting one that I think should be explored more in fanfiction, but as I've gone over elsewhere, blowing open a hole in a story like this isn't fair play.

​

I find your position a bit confused. You seem to be criticizing people for extrapolating from the cannon and concocting justifications for an apparent plot-hole. You go on to imply this is bad because Rowling didn't intend it - in fact she had no real answer to the inconsistency of the Dursely's awfulness and Dumbledore's Goodness.

Attempting to reconcile the two is bad because it is *making stuff up*.

But the entire purpose of the activity is to *engage with a fictional world.* Yes, people get invested and extrapolate far beyond the author's intentions. (if you think this is bad, spend some time in [[/r/asoiaf]] !); and, at some level there is no *real* answer to "why did Dumbledore leave Harry with the Dursleys" because Dumbledore isn't a real person.

But I wouldn't say this isn't "fair play".

It is play. It is having fun in an imaginary world, and attempting to make of that world the most nuanced and compelling story you can.

And as such it does have rules - the conclusions aren't random. They are trying to build a model that is consistent internally and with all observed facts. This, to me, is absolutely "fair play."

I wanted to imply that there's a difference between using the observations you already have versus modifying the story. Playing around with Dumbledore as an antagonist is interesting, but going into conspiracy theorist mode about whatever reason he left Harry at the Dursleys is going to result in more questions, because that particular decision is inconsistent with the rest of his character. Once you "solve" that one question, you're forced to reinterpret the entire story in light of it, which opens up more questions. Maybe the process of answers creating more questions stops somewhere, and you've successfully explained canon Dumbledore's actions, maybe it doesn't. What matters is that the moment you reimagine Dumbledore's role for the sake of explaining his canon /actions/, you've sacrificed his canon /character/, and the character of whoever else was swept up in his conspiracy. Sacrificing canon accuracy for canon accuracy is kind of a raw deal when it comes at the expense of your impression of a kindly authority figure.

And all of that's only if you somehow manage to find an explanation for all of his canon actions from the perspective of a level one intelligent character. This perspective must not make Dumbledore do things that he didn't do in canon, because then we run into the obstacle of sacrificing canon accuracy for canon accuracy again. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Rowling's work, but I'd be putting it lightly if I said I was /extremely skeptical/ that her work had some internally consistent explanation like that.

If reinterpreting canon like that was the only way to write a villain Dumbledore, I would be more understanding. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic][But it's not]]. Literally the only reason you would ever end up with a Dumbledore like this is if you tried to meet the /artificial constraint/ of not changing all of the canon events. My alternative suggestion was, instead of looking to canon for answers that might not lead anywhere, to use your internal creativity to come up with something that actually makes the story make more sense instead of less. Especially because actual authors in the wild use that constraint of canon events to justify bashing Dumbledore when they simultaneously modify other parts of canon to their own preference.

why isn't this "fair play" in a fanfic? the entire activity revolves around re-imagining the story world?

or, why isn't it fair play in fandom fullstop? imagining head-cannon to explain apparent discrepancies is part of invested fandom.

I guess I get everything you are saying, I'm just not sure what your point is. Are you saying people aren't allowed do this? that is invalid somehow?

It more seems like you are criticizing people who do it /poorly/ in fanfic, which is an entirely different thing.

***** I'm more saying that it's extremely improbable to do it in any way but poorly. I'm warning against doing it because the only stories I've ever seen of someone doing it that way are bad. Additionally, I'm providing an explanation as to why I think that they failed. I think "fair play" was a bad phrase to use, but that's what it feels like - people who do this pretend they're competing on an even level with other fanfic authors because they've solved /one inconsistency/ in the canon, but most of the time they're running on imaginary realism. That, by revealing the /true/ motivations of one character, they've suddenly made the story more realistic. Even a cursory examination will show that most of them haven't changed or challenged any of the /other/ things that make no sense, or that they've replaced them with even less sensible versions.

The reasons they fail are usually simple:

1. They're exercising a grudge where none should exist ([[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/empathyrespect][a good author should have some empathy for their villains]]). This is usually because /they/ at one point believed Dumbledore was good, and the idea that he was bad is a betrayal. This can make them write him less intelligently than they ought to.
2. They waste all of their mental resources trying to cover up one plothole, and fail to cover up others. The singular plot hole in question is only one of many, but because of the manipulative!Dumbledore meme, it's the only one that a lot of authors think they need to solve.
3. Having actually set up a Dumbledore that is evil, they fail to capitalize on it because they're too busy religiously following the other plot points. I mentioned this in another comment chain, but it's hard to have Dumbledore be a proper antagonist when he still has to act the same way canon Dumbledore did on the surface. Any overtly antagonistic action on Dumbledore's part also has to simultaneously come with an explanation of why canon Harry (inquisitive, quick to mistrust abusive authority) never observed it, otherwise, their version of Dumbledore loses all pretense of being close to the canon.
4. Even as an antagonist, Dumbledore has to compete with Wizard Hitler. Those are some pretty high stakes to run up against. If Harry ends up calling Dumbledore out on sacrificing people for the greater good, it would be pretty strange if Dumbledore didn't have a good argument backing himself up. But in these stories, Dumbledore usually doesn't justify himself well at all - he still engages with Harry on the level of the eleven-year-old he was in canon, even when Harry is engaging with him on the level of a skeptical, angry adult. It usually feels like the author is deliberately sabotaging Dumbledore's chances at being justified, rather than actually testing their own beliefs. Again, this is [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/77][yet another problem that HPMOR solved]] simply by departing from canon for a little bit. (CTRL-F for "phoenix's price" to find what I'm talking about).

That's what I mean. Like I've said before, evil!Dumbledore isn't something that's inherently wrong. But exploring that concept by twisting canon around in such a way that it appears /canon/ Dumbledore is evil, is nonsensical. It's trying to be faithful to canon by disregarding what canon meant emotionally, and if you're just going to disregard canon as a fanfiction author anyway, why would you disregard it in such a way as to preserve /only the parts of canon that make a certain character look bad?/ It's sloppy.

****** The way I would put it is that an evil Dumbledore is actually a great change from the Dumbledore depicted in HP canon, and if you want to write that changed Dumbledore, it should have many consequences everywhere including that Dumbledore does not do many of his canon actions. To defend this by pointing out that somebody in the special genre of children's book did something that looks evil in an adult book is unfaithful to the story logic of canon Dumbledore and results in a grotesquely inconsistent world. Canon Dumbledore is not a consistent evil character. If you want consistency his actions cannot be the exact canon actions, period, and why are you trying for exact repetition in a fanfic anyways? You can try to rationalize the exact canon actions by changing other facts and characters, but then that becomes the whole story, and that's very rarely worth it.

****** Okay. It kind of sounds like you just don't like some fanfics where Dumbledore is portrayed badly.

This doesn't really say anything about rational fic in general, or even the idea of criticizing Dumbledore or portraying him as simply manipulative, utilitarian, or careless. I guess I get how seeing this done poorly could be a pet peeve though.

*** u/ArgentStonecutter:

  Consider a story where one of the main villains is a stereotypical greedy capitalist who is testing one of their inhumane products on the poor underclass. One of your characters is making their way through the corporate headquarters, reading classified documents and finding out about the true nature of the company, and then quips: "Who the hell even buys this stuff anyway?"
#+end_quote

This would be more convincing if there weren't so many examples of inhumane products.

Or even just stupidly designed products, like an induction cooktop where putting a largish pan on the element activates the power switch and turns it off (or on) unintentionally. Such things actually exist.

**** Wow. I'm not sure what happened there. I have no memory of typing that comment. I think I was trying to say something about plastic water bottles and plastic drinking straws and plastic individually-wrapped candy bars, but looking at it now I don't see how that follows as a response to your comment about inhumane products, because they're /not/ inhumane, they're just technically immoral.

I may have brought up the egg cooker in reaction to

#+begin_quote
  an induction cooktop where putting a largish pan on the element activates the power switch and turns it off (or on) unintentionally
#+end_quote

because it works by converting water to steam and it shuts itself off once all the water has boiled away.

Either way, I apologize. I'm too good at typing (I'm not claiming to be the best at typing, or even in the top 80%) (the previous parenthetical exists because the "Elizabeth" pseudonym is arrogant on purpose a lot of the time, and I'm not speaking as Elizabeth and I don't want my words to be misinterpreted, I'm not boasting about my typing skills) so my fingers are capable of doing it just based off muscle memory so my brain can be almost entirely nonfunctional and I can still type (for the most part).

Oh, and as far as claiming it would be "uneducated" to drink the tap water, I'm currently living at my grandmother's house and she has a well and the well has been tested and there's lead in the water.

**** You're not wrong. Sure, I'd feel bad about drinking excclusively *(drunk, ca't typ like ommoraly,(), I don't drink soda. I only drink alcohol sometimes. I drink water. I'm in a situation where' it'd be uneducatred to drink the tap water, so I drink bottled water. Like, I drink o=nothing but bottled water. Plastic straws and "don't steal this product" packaging are much more egregious than just water bottles. I have a "perfect egg cooker" and it's perfect.
