Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I've been reading [[https://katalepsis.net/][Katalepsis]], which is kind of Gothic horror mixed with Lovecraftian horror. Or, as the author describes it, "urban fantasy story / lesbian supernatural soap opera, with a little bit of a horror coating."

The premise is a young woman's sister goes missing while they're kids. Afterwards, no one can remember her, so people think she's crazy. Also she can suddenly see demons/Eldritch horrors all around her, which doesn't help. The story starts when (as you might guess) she figures out she's not crazy, hooks up with some quasi-demon hunters, and tries to get her sister back.

I enjoyed the development of both story and characters. They're both well fleshed out and draw you in. The characters are well described, with their own personalities, strengths, faults, goals, and fears.

The story largely takes place on Earth, in a small university town called Sharrowford. It's well described and built up as a small sleepy town where nothing much happens, until you get to the cults and whatnot. It's actually not described that much, rather the places the MC visits are. You get a feel for the relevant parts, but most of Sharrowford exists on the periphery of the story. Aside form the MC, her friends, enemies and allies, I don't think we ever meet another named character.

The writing is quite well done. It's got a good flow and not too flowery or overly verbose (unless it's describing a demon or cosmic horror). I don't remember any obvious problems, or even minor grammatical errors.

*** I've asked this same question before and here are what people have said:

The Final Girls (2015 horror comedy film) The main character's mother has just died and in an effort to remember her, she goes to watch a classic horror slasher film that is a thin parody of Friday the 13th where her mother was the final girl. After a strange accident, she and her friends find themselves stuck in the movie. A funny deconstruction and logical chain of events follows as they try to survive the movie.

Eden Green by Fiona van Dahl - a rational horror novel where a character finds her friend has been infected by a strange parasite that that has made him immortal. Eden, the main character, is a self-styled rationalist, and her thought processes are shown in pain-staking detail. Whereas her friends treat everything as a big adventure or a true chance for ending death, Eden does her best (as an amateur) to apply scientific rationale to the symbiote and the strange monsters that are starting to show up. There is some body horror but most of the truly scary stuff is how it goes into exhaustive detail on how people's thought processes and consciousness change.

The promised neverland - a manga and later anime that is very rational and logical with intricate strategies and mental battles. The first season/story arc anyway as the rest of the story never comes close to the first arc in my opinion. The story takes place in an orphanage of love where the children are raised and tested constantly to improve their intelligence. All goes well until a small group discover a horrifying truth about their world that I won't spoil as they tell it to you at the end of the first episode and chapter. But now with the horrible truth revealed, the children must figure out a way to escape the orphanage.

Hell NO: The Sensible Horror Film - a short on youtube that opens with a group of teenagers arriving to spend the weekend at a creepy cabin in the woods. They promptly leave and drive to get wasted at the beach instead. The rest of the shorts of the film follow a similar theme. Short but funny.

The Thing (original not the remake)- the characters ARE intelligent and rational but it just doesn't matter much. The paranoia and lack of trust are what ultimately dooms them.

10 Cloverfield Lane - The main character is incredibly resourceful and intelligent in a very nasty situation.

You're Next - The Anti Slasher movie in that the last girl is arguably more dangerous than the slashers. She has trained for survival, hand to hand combat, and traps by her survivalist father. Something that she is initially mocked for and it also shows how normal people WOULD panic and make stupid decisions. In this movie, a slasher wearing a mask has trouble breathing through it and it throws off his peripheral vision.

Wait until Dark - It started as a play and there have been a few remakes, but I only saw the 60's movie with audrey hepburn. A drug dealer hid some heroin in a doll which came into possession of a blind woman. They kill her roommate and decide to trick the main character, who hasn't been blind for very long, into getting into the house and finding the doll. The main character is intelligent and finds some believable ways to suspect the conmen aren't real and figures out a way to turn the tables.

High Tension 2003 film- The main character is crafty and very smart to stay ahead of the killer. Up until the ending. Just ignore the last few minutes and twist ending.

Green Room - they make rational decisions but things are so against them that it really doesn't matter much.

Splinter - The character make smart choices and its really the only reason they survive.

Tremors - Not sure if it counts as horror to modern audiences but they carefully figure out how the monsters work and think of counter measures. Then the monsters get smarter and they need to one up them.

Train to Busan - Maybe. They are panicked and still have no idea how things work but they make believable decisions. Might be a culture thing, but in America the main "villain" probably would have been killed or thrown out for the potential trouble he would be in the future.

*** If you're fine with visual novels, I'd recommend checking out [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/648100/Raging_Loop/][Raging Loop]]. I posted it in the weekly thread a couple months back after having a really good time with it. The protagonist starts out a bit wacky in an Ignatius Reilly type way, but when push comes to shove, he becomes very analytical. It makes for an interesting dynamic.

I will say that while it bills itself as a horror story, I personally didn't find it all that scary, but I tend to not find horror media scary in general so YMMV. It's also a bit expensive for a game with no gameplay, but I'm pretty sure the first quarter is up for free on YouTube.

The only reason that the protagonists don't win in the first 15 minutes is because they have an additional goal of proving to the world that the antagonist exists.

****** Well, it's a bit of work and you'll need a sewing machine, a (duplex) laser printer, and a shop capable of slicing thick stacks of paper, but here's the process I used:

1. Download/rip/copypaste text into a Word document and do formatting. Add things like dynamic TOC, page numbers, cover page, etc. Also, add blank pages to ensure new chapters start on odd (or even) pages so it looks good. Make sure font size is good.

2. Print as booklets. This part is a bit tricky and you'll either need a duplex-capable printer or the discipline to do it on a one-sided printer. I printed four-sheet booklets meaning that each booklet contained 16 pages

3. Assemble booklets. Fold each batch of four sheets in half and nest them so the page numbers are in the proper order. Then, using a sewing machine and thread color of choice, sew down the middle of the fold in each booklet. Make sure to do some tests first so you can dial in the thread tension.

4. Bind the booklets together. Stack and align all the folded and sewed booklets, then clamp them flat under pressure in a vice or between sheets of wood. Find a ribbon or other piece of cloth to glue onto the binding. I used hot glue--you want a glue that stays flexible when dry.

5. Get the pages trimmed to size. Now that you have a book, all the pages will be slightly different sizes. I took mine to a Copyshop and had them use their thick stack paper slicer to cut the non-bound edges to perfectly flat.

6. Add a cover. This is a bit tricky because you need to make sure that the book can still open. If you're going for hardcover, it's easiest if the spine is flexible, maybe cloth.

7. Enjoy your book!

*** [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing][Prince of Nothing Trilogy]] is centered around a holy war, and deals closely with religion and faith from the protagonist's very cynical perspective.

The sequel series [*major spoilers*] is set decades after the protagonist from the first trilogy has been declared a prophet of the religion he was exploiting. He has unlimited control of the entire world and turns the entirety of human civilization to another holy war, this time against extra-dimensional aliens who want to destroy the entire universe because they found out that hell is actually real. It's some wild shit.

They're both intensely rational works, written by a rather pedantic philosophy PhD. I loved the shit out of both of them.

For non-fiction, [[https://acoup.blog/category/collections/practical-polytheism/][*Practical Polytheism]] is an engaging and very readable short blog series about religion in the ancient world - not much like the stereotypes!

And while only dubiously rational (it's a nice fantasy setting...), David Eddings' /Elenium/ trilogy features Church knights as protagonists, with considerable religious intrigue. I remember that abuse of the proceedure for determining the voting threshold for motions in church meetings was a plot point... More fun than that makes it sound.

**** It has an OP MC who doesn't take unrealistic actions, does a multitude of cool things including making an organization to benefit the whole world with enough realism that it doesn't make me cringe and the way pokemon are described and connected to their trainers are really nice. <- This is like 90% of my subjective favorites in a story so it would be Awesome to me.

The negatives would be its not too rational, I feel everyone agrees too easily with the MC a little but this may be completely realistic if you take into account that Aura users can't lie. (Would authoritarianism work if all the top leadership can't lie and have been proven to have good intentions? Not sure, and the way most people just goes with it feels a little weird to me.) The world is just explained enough that it doesn't brake emersion (such as Jenny's and Joy's are explained as a "clan", like psychics or aura users) but I feel getting rid of them would be more realistic. Its very "sappy" with lots of brooding but mostly loads of "I love you"'s. Some of the pokemon's affection I feel is a little forced but not enough to turn me off. The battles would be cool but I don't care about action so I just skip those usually. I just like the "crushes everyone and interacts with crowd after" and "does X heroic things and see people's reactions" scenes which there are plenty off.

Edit: Also, it looks dead but it ends on a decent place with the first meeting with ash, so I don't feel unsatisfied actually which is very rare for me and unfinished stories.

**** Yeah, except I would upgrade that to a hard de-rec. It has some of the flavor of things this sub likes, but it fails utterly on substance. I just gave up on it at somewhat farther along than you did. The main character (and all the characters, really) get major power ups for essentially no effort, they seem to be entirely reacting to the plot with no proactiveness at all, and I just don't really understand why I, or the characters, should care about anything in the plot at all.

Major spoilers: We aren't given a very good reason for any of the characters to have a problem with the Fateweavers, or the prophecy more broadly, since it's hinted that the culture more generally views the fateweavers and prophecy to be tools of their society's success and power. The fact that it seems to end badly for them individually doesn't seem like enough for /all/ of them to, without much thought, decide to act against the prophecy It would be like having a squad of soldiers told that a mission integral to the success of a war is likely to result in their death. That one or two of them would object, sure...but all of them? None of these people thinks it's worth dying to continue the success of their country? And furthermore, when and how the prophecy is able to force/prevent action is completely unexplained and reeks of the worst sort of "because the plot needed it to work that way in this situation". The story as a whole has a veneer of "hard fantasy" but it's just that: a veneer. Underneath the surface it is just as handwave-y and soft as any other fantasy series since the "rules" are unexplained and so complicated that it's not possible for a reader to get any idea of what is or is not possible.

As a frame of reference, they found 'The Untitled Goose Game' too difficult to play, and that's one of the most commonly suggested games for young kids

In terms of requirements:

1. The game has to be forgiving of inaccurate and slow input accuracy. They struggle when they need to make accurate inputs quickly
2. Preferably, the game would not be story based, as they can't read yet.
3. Ideally, the game would be fun too. Donut County is good because eating things with holes is fun regardless of how easy it is

The only other game that I've found that meets this criteria is Katamari Damacy, but I haven't tried it out yet.

I've tried searching for lists of these types of games, but I haven't found much success. Those types of lists tend to be geared towards kids of older ages. I've seen some people say that kids that young shouldn't be playing video games, and should basically be doing anything else. That's fair, but not really helpful in this case. This video game session happens when the kids can't go out, and this kids siblings love playing Terraria, a game that they can't join in because it's too hard for them. Having a video game that they can play goes a long way towards making them feel included, and that's not something that they get often.

Coop games that have the second player play a much easier role than the first player are okay too

*** I suggest Minecraft. While I have no firsthand experience with little children playing it, I have seen other parents mentioning that their 4/5 year old plays it.

Minecraft doesn't need a good accuracy for normal gameplay, it is not story-based and it is a lot of fun - see huge long term success over all age groups.

I would recommend to start out with creative mode, so the child can play around a bit and learn the control mechanics. Then maybe switch to survival on peaceful difficulty. Look for a mod which locks peaceful difficulty, I'm sure there exists one. I would also recommend one which lets you keep your inventory if your player character dies (from falling, drowning, lava in peaceful mode).

Minecraft is great to learn exploring, trying out things you imagine and being creative. I also see no problems with violence as long as it is in peaceful mode - the above mentioned modes of dying aren't depicted in a horrifying fashion for a 4 year old, but that is just a guess. Check out Youtube videos if in doubt.

Minecraft can also be played in (local) multiplayer. And there is an education version somewhere out there, I think, although I haven't checked and don't now what it entails. I recommend the Java version as it is the most versatile one (mods, ...).

I have personally only played computer games from 7 years on. But for the latter age group I would recommend games like Anno, The Settlers, zoo simulations.

*** My own experience with childhood games was one of a lot of frustration; My father pretty much only played default Windows games, and he didn't buy me that many games. The games he did buy were mostly random (though I assume he asked the store clerk). I also did not know English, and nobody who knew some English translated for me, so I went into games terra incognita. This made many games unplayable, and I also frequently got stuck in various points in the games I could play. I don't remember things very well, but I think the early games that I ever finished took me years. (My computer time was limited to around two hours per week by my mother.) I also played the games (pretty much all single-player games) with my cousins in the rare times we were together (we lived not in the same cities), and we shared our “discoveries” about the games. (Sharing the games themselves was easy because they were all sold pirated and DRM-free here in Iran.) The whole experience of it was very exhilarating; Everything felt more more like a real-life mystery, and the immersion was more unbroken. It also felt somewhat exotic, perhaps in the way the Orient feels to the Westerners. Anyways, they definitely utilized my grit and curiosity more than anything else in my childhood, and perhaps even ever. There was, e.g., a non-intended jump you do to skip a whole room's intended gameplay (in the first level of Toy Story 2) and reach the final prize platform, and I remember doing that weekly because I did not know how to save the game and also did not know the proper way to reach the prize. I tried that some years ago, and could not do the non-standard jump even once; I think it required a lot of trial-and-error ...

I suggest you try Flash games to find casual games 4-years-olds can play. They run the whole spectrum of complexity, but there are a lot of simple games children can play in there. I could even play some without knowing any English or a guiding adult with me (though I wasn't four). You can use BlueMaxima's Flashpoint to play flash games easily. (It's really nice! A catalogue of hundreds of games that you can play for free, dowloaded on demand.) Another good thing about this strategy is that as the child grows older, you can just let them try games themselves and find stuff they like.

Casual mobile games such as Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Cut the Rope, etc will also probably work. (These are somewhat similar to Flash games.)

The games that I enjoyed the most from my childhood (and can remember their names), but the child needs to be older: - Pink Panther - The Neighbor from Hell 1, 2 (there is an HD remake on Steam) - Toy Story 2, 3 - Hercules - Harry Potter games if the child likes the franchise (games two and three were better done IMHO, and later games that required mouse-casting are awkward even for adults.)

PS: My path to currently being a tech savvy CS graduate started from installing and troubleshooting games, and then administering the computer (reinstalling Windows , backuping game save files, etc).

PPS: I spent a lot of my childhood having nothing to do, and I think it's necessary. I am even thinking of adding this to my current life as quasi-meditation sessions. Having time with nothing to do let's you think, fantasize, and cherish life ...

*** I have a four year old who is able to navigate peaceful Minecraft more or less on his own.

The first PC game that I had him learn was Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise, which is one of Humongous Entertainment's suite of point-and-click adventure titles from the mid-90's. Some enterprising soul has acquired the rights to them and gotten an emulator to work with modern Windows and sells them on steam for like $5 a pop. There's at least two dozen titles to choose from; I just happen to know Fatty Bear like the back of my hand so I chose that one as the introduction (I acquired the entire set on sale for like $25 several years ago in anticipation of this very application).

As a point-and-click, there's no action or twitch reflexes required, and being that it targets kids, each room is full of wacky and zany things to click on, giving him an incentive to explore while slowly learning how to use a mouse. There's no text, and the game presents the player with goals through full voice acting.

It took a few months of semiregular play for him to get it. I put him on my lap and guided the mouse while he clicked, eventually graduating to having him control the mouse and sitting in the chair on his own. I started around when he was 2, so it's possible yours might pick it up faster.

From there we tried minecraft, again with him on my lap controlling the mouse while I worked the left hand keyboard controls. Eventually he had the hang of it enough to be able to move forward (I tell him the W is for Walk), open the inventory, and throw things on the ground. I have it set to peaceful as he takes his time getting around and would likely get stomped by AI at this point.

Before we ever went on the PC, however, we got him a cheap android tablet and loaded it up with a number of apps. Most of them try to be somewhat educational (I have letter and number apps, a handwriting app, math bingo, and a proto-programming game that he has just in the last year managed to grok), but there's also some games just for fun as well, including puzzle apps, random activity apps, a piano app, and things like a Lego building app.

He devours these at any rate I'll feed them to him, and I place full credit for his ability to read and write at the feet of some of these apps. If you want I can get a full list of what we use.

Besides those, I also have a couple of games on my phone that I permit him to play with limited time, such as Angry Birds and Hero Rescue, tho these are more because of ads and such that I don't trust him unsupervised time with lest I end up with a gutted wallet.

All told I think I'm satisfied with his progress; in a number of ways he's ahead of the curve. His 2 year old sister has made similar progress, tho we shan't see if it paid off so well until she grasps it all. She can read off the alphabet if nothing else, so the potential is there.

*** I mostly played the original Legend Of Zelda at that age. Took me a whole year. Even though it's a lot harder than later Zelda games, it meets your criteria better, as things don't move very quickly, the plot is irrelevant, and you can generally progress by going somewhere at random and hitting your head against it. I think crucially there was no real expectation that I should be any better at it than I was; having other kids able to step in and help might make it feel more daunting.

I'd also consider Mario games (though I found them frustrating until I was five). The older ones are fine with an infinite lives cheat. The newer 2D ones are probably okay, but I don't know first hand. Mario Galaxy has your requested much easier player two role, which I've seen kids get a kick out of.

More recent games, which I don't have experience playing as or with a kid:

- Celeste has an extensive accessibility/assistance mode that might actually work well for kids, the same way my Game Genie did when I was a kid.

- Maybe Goat Simulator? The controls are complicated, but you can just do whatever and that is, indeed, the point. It's not very wholesome though.

- Zen Bound 2 is a puzzle game about 3D reasoning that uses no words or numbers.

- Incredipede (on normal) is a puzzle game about figuring out how to move as a poorly designed physics creature. It has very easy controls. If it gets harder, I got bored before it did. But it's cute, I'd look into it as a kids game.

*** Multi-days-late reply: I have a now 6-year-old; Katamari Damacy itself isn't a great choice because of the time limits in levels, which can be frustrating to a 4-year-old, though I had a lot of success with Katamari Forever (PS3), which (if you've beaten a level yourself well enough) has "eternal" mode in levels with no time limit and he loved it.

On mobile/tablet, I'd highly highly recommend the (free) PBS Kids app, which has about a hundred small games that swap out over time, all themed after PBS shows and appropriate for 4-6 year olds in both content and pacing.

I had the most success at that age with mobile games, honestly, though the problem is that most "kids" games a) need reading, b) are a little too hard, or c) the big one, shove ads in your face. The games that worked for us from ages 4-5 were:

- Toca Nature (small terraforming/play with animals game)
- Loopimal (loop-based music creator)
- Crazy Gears (puzzles)
- Frost (puzzle game)

As he got closer to 6, he loved Love You To Bits, Bring You Home (puzzle adventure games), Shine (adventure), and Sky (adventure, though I don't think when he started that he knew what the heck was going on).

But mostly PBS Kids.

​

Human civilization collapses, a colony in an alien planet gets stranded. To try to reconnect or escape they do some heavy bioengineering on the native fauna, and on humans themselves, eventually a highly intelligent group animals unite and destroy their civilization. They lose their tech and their history.

​

Thanks to the planets lower gravity and the genetic augmentations some humans who descend from soldiers display incredible feats like improved healing and superhuman strength. Others who descend from scholars and leaders form a different species that's longer lived and more intelligent than average humans.

​

Together they fight for survival in this alien world full of dragons and giant monsters. The only memory of their past as a space faring civilization is what they call the Sapphire Star, which is actually an abandoned space station orbiting the planet..

​

** Any recommendations for smut? Preferably M/F. The only one I see pitched around here is The Erogamer, which is on my list. On a side note, which stories on questionable questing are worth reading (also preferably smut)?

*** [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/reader]] Unfinished quest, by author "Question Dragon". On permanent hiatus until the worldbuilding same universe quest "days of Thyme" , which is also on permanent hiatus.

The author also has started a warhammer 40k/dungeon keeper series, pretty short but active. [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/blood-thirsty-dungeon-keeper-in-space.12569/page-2#post-3629685]]

Of these three, only "days of Thyme" has no smut. Prose is very good.

EDIT: I got that from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ary2zx/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/egrjn87/][this link from last year]], of which I've also enjoyed Conduit.

**** Anything not abandoned or on hiatus? Especially when something like a quest or a fanfic goes on hiatus and the author starts something new instead I have very little faith that it will ever be continued.

***** Sins of Cinnamon is pretty large and good enough that I personally don't mind the permanent hiatus, otherwise I wouldn't have recommend it.

Otherwise I haven't read much on QQ, quality to noise ratio is just too low.

*** If you're willing to try games, [[https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]] is pretty good.

I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ismlth/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g5q7i6b/][a longer post]] a couple months ago that covers it in some detail, but in short it's a smutty rpg about a jaded veteran who gains a sex based power from the same source as the evil overlord who is plaguing his Homeland.

There's a pretty strong emphasis on sensible decision-making and a use of "soft power" like economics and diplomacy that I've not seen in /any/ rpg, adult or otherwise. The setting is explicitly non rational, but the response to it from the main characters is exactly what anyone from this subreddit might hope for.

** Anyone got a progression/fantasy of a crafter type stuff?

As for what I read this week wasn't exactly rational but [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution][Borne of Caution]] was a rather refreshing read? I did get a bit frustrated with the MC's thought process in some of the later chapters but it was a rather nice read.

*** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31474/magic-smithing][Magic-Smithing]] is a litrpg where the protagonist focuses on, as you may guess, smithing. I'm not sure it qualifies as rational, but the exploration of the skill and magic system so far has been fun.

** Giving a cautious recommendation to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36075/shotgun-fantasy][Shotgun Fantasy]], which was recommended by its author in this thread a few weeks ago, iirc.

Basics of the setting is a standard fantasy world in which humans are a magicless, colonized underclass of elves, but the recent invention of firearms by humans now threatens this.

Like many web serials, the start of the novel is particularly rough, with very functional writing and characters that lack any kind of distinctive voice or personality. Fortunately the writing quality has slowly improved as the author has written; there's still plenty of room for improvement, hence the "cautious" recommendation, but between the incline in quality and the uniqueness of the setting, it could be a good pickup. As rational fiction it is okay, characters are not stupid but not highly rational either, worldbuilding approaches realism but has some flaws.

** Hi, I'm looking for some progression fantasy. It doesn't have to be 100% rational but I would prefer if it doesn't have any idiot ball or any I'm evil just 'cause type of character. And nothing with less than 300.000 words or 1 published book. Pls assume I already know WtC, all of wildbow's fictions or the other works that are recommended every thread. Thx.

*** [[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07J675X2C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o09?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Into the Labyrinth]] might fit what you're looking for. I read it awhile back and enjoyed it. It was a bit short, but it's part of the Mage Errant series, which has several books that total over 1300 pages.

I have some other suggestions, but they're LitRPG's and I'm not sure that's what you're looking for.

***** It's a mixed bag. Some are more rational than others, but they all have rational elements in one way or another, whether it be characters, their goals, actions and solutions, or wordbuilding.

A lot of these are relatively new, the only one with more than 300,000 words would be /Unbound/, though some others are getting there, and some have a finished book.
