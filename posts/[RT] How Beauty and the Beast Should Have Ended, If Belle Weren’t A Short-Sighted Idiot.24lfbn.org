*** Agreed. Even if Belle were somehow able to step back from her being-in-love perspective to make a purely selfish choice, the author's scenario is seriously subpar. Ruling a moldering castle run by animated objects, that doesn't actually rule anything else because it's blocked off by Evil Forest, in isolated loneliness is not a particularly great life. Instead, she could profess her love, break the curse, gain a husband who loves her, who owns an actually repairable castle filled with /people/, with the potential to re-establish dominion over the surrounding area. I think the writer has made a Classic Error of Ravenclaw, and is maybe seriously morally deficient.

*** Yeah, seriously. You'd have to be a very weird sort of straw vulcan to find /any/ value in this scenario. It's like the author assumes normal human emotions like guilt, love, empathy and morality don't exist. Even for an evil Belle the novelty of having your own castle with a bunch of animated objects would last... maybe a few days, weeks? after which you just wanna get back to normal life. It'd be more fun to just abuse your emotionally weak husband and real human servants.

*** Entirely unconcerned with the idea of Beast dying and wanting to profit from his death, at least. Beast showed clear signs of being abusive. While it's entirely possible to think his abusiveness was linked to the stress of his condition, that just means he's safe*r* in happy times and unsafe in stressful times.

Drop that sucker like a bag of angry vipers and don't look back.

And be nice to the people working with and for you. They can make your life hell if they choose.

** Setting aside the massive alteration to her character that would require, still no. I'm obviously of a different mind than the author if they weren't just writing for the humor, but I'd personally rank ruling through marriage with someone I love a formerly-enchanted castle filled with loyal and living servants wile regaining regency of the entire surrounding region superior to ruling a ruin of a castle alone in the forest, even with undying servants - especially given the unhappiness of said undying servants; I agree with [[/u/Iconochasm]] on this point.

Now, if you want a rational take on the story? Try this:

--------------

Belle, our resident rationalist, plays straight the first portion of the story; she replaces her father as prisoner to save his failing health. We'll even make allowances for spurning the Beast's attempt to invite her to dinner and later to try sneaking into the forbidden West Wing; rationalists can make mistakes and emotional calls too, after all. So, as baseline, she is saved by the beast, and they begin to warm towards each other.

In this case however, she is prone to asking more questions; she makes observations of the enchantment as far as who was turned into what, and of things like how much motor control and other abilities - say, igniting - their forms have. She shows an interest in the servants and their plight, and either through induction or the others being warmed enough to tell her, she learns of the origin of the curse, though they don't tell her what it takes to break it for fear of her feelings being tainted by the thought of them being needed for removing the curse.

This leads to the scene with the magic mirror, and here is where we would get a major change. She Sees her father struggling and dying in a search for her, that is no different. While Original Belle rushed off to save her father and take him home - which certainly isn't a /bad/ idea - Rational!Belle has more resources to draw upon, and perhaps will think of a better way to deal with this. For example:

Belle, realizing her father is dying of cold, knows she must warm him as soon as possible. As the Beast sees her worry, he releases her. She tells him she will return as soon as she can and asks for his aid. He, overjoyed that she would want it, extends as much as she offers and more; she leaves in the spider-carriage alongside an animated set of candles or five, a teapot filled with water, and several other servants with forms that will be useful for what they are attempting. They save him and spirit him back to their cottage - let's assume that was still the safest bet.

They settle in for treatment. Having used the mirror to find and save him, Belle experiments with its use in helping him revive, and finds out what limits the mirror has. It would be curious to see if "Show me the medicine that would aid my father" would work, and to find out if it can glance forward or backward in time, and so forth. We'll assume it works pretty much as seen, and simply shows what it is commanded to in the present but with an ability to understand and extrapolate (e.g. "Show me 'the girl'" worked for Belle).

Her father wakes, they have their conversation about how the beast improved and came to love her (in so many words), before a knock reveals the lynch mob come to take her father to the asylum, composed largely of average villagers who have been made into mob by Gaston. Belle learns what's going on, her father makes his declaration, and Belle turns down Gaston's ultimatum. As before, she realizes she can prove her father isn't crazy, and she orders the mirror to show the beast - who /isn't/ howling this time, since Belle left with he promise to return.

The crowd is still somewhat frightened, and she tries to assure them that the Beast is kind - and in doing so calls out the Servants who returned with her - probably Chip, Lumiere, and Mrs. Pots; speaking roles after all. they line up on the railing of the house, introduce themselves to the crowd's bewilderment, and proclaim that their master is no threat to the people, speaking to his (recent) civility and kindness. Belle confirms the statement, which leads Gaston to ask about her /feelings/ for "this monster".

Unlike the original, rather than being baited, she responds by demanding loudly of the mirror "Show me the man who threatened to have my father dragged away to the asylum unless I *married him!*" She shows the crowd the mirror, which now displays Gaston. They pause, and suddenly their sensibilities get a jolt; the beast is forgotten for a moment with this revaluation, and the morality of what is going on begins to sink in. Belle goes further before Gaston can try to react, crying "Show me the price Gaston payed to have my father wrongly imprisoned!" - and the mirror shows a bag of gold, wherever it was concealed by the Asylum head (Monsieur D'Arque). This turns the crowd from surprised to angry, and Gaston tries to make his play for power, yanking the mirror from her hands and pushing her aside, but it's a little too late; he tries to spur hatred and fear for the beast, but Belle calls him out as a liar and a fraud, and the mob turns upon /him/ this time. Gaston, well and truly thwarted, attempts to exact vengeance upon Belle and her father, seeing them as having kept him from what he wants - but they are protected by the servants - including Mr. Spider-Carraige and whoever helped her carry her father - long enough for the mob to get their hands and ropes on him. For the sake of a better climax later in the story, he could be driven off rather than captured, to return at the worst possible moment.

There is a tension between village and the transformed servants, but Belle does everything she can to send them home peacefully - after calling out Monsieur D'Arque for his part, but despite her assurances there are still those worried enough to wish to see for themselves. Seeing little option, she leads a group (rather than a mob) for the castle, sending the carriage and servants ahead to let the Beast know what's going on.

The Beast prepares a lavish reception, the servants kick into high gear - after all, they've been shown to take pride in their work, and having a feast to prepare after years of disuse sounds like something that they would relish - and the villagers are met in splendor and wonder. While still somewhat socially awkward, the Beast warms immediately once Belle is back, and makes at least a modest impression if not an outright good one.

Of course, the Rose is still wilting, and it remains the Beast's birthday, so some of the servants are likely worried, but the Beast is merely enraptured with Belle and on making that good impression. Presuming we want a bigger climax than "Her father asks 'do you love him', she says 'yes', the curse goes away", this would be a good spot for the disheveled Gaston to return, having snuck in, and shoot Beast with an arrow from a vantage point. The beast, rather than flying into a rage, notes his /next/ target and moves to protect Belle, getting feathered a few more times in dramatic fashion before the servants get their act together and ready a counter-assault. Gaston is forced to retreat into the castle, and we're treated to a Mook Horror Show as the servants loose their pent-up frustrations upon him; he is forced to retreat deeper and deeper into the castle as /everything/ attacks him, from direct assaults by large furniture (and suits of armor!) to stalking things leaping from above or snapping at his hamstrings. How he meets his end I will leave to your imagination, dear readers; perhaps he is driven to the high towers and defenestrated by a chandler. Perhaps he is driven to the depths, and comes upon Mr. Furnace in a foul mood.

But, suffice to say he is dealt with, and back in the main hall the servants are trying to save the beast after his act of self-sacrifice; Belle has just enough time to whisper "I love you", the curse breaks, and Adam suddenly looks scarier then he was a moment ago. (I kid, I kid) Yada, yada, happily ever after.

--------------

Of course, if you /don't/ need that form of dramatic climax in movie-time, you could always have Belle, upon saving her father in the woods, return him to the /well stocked and staffed castle/ to recover, giving ample opportunity to declare her love and for the curse to be broken. Or you can play up the exploration of the mirror's powers earlier in the story. Or you can let the curse solidify while Belle is away (say, she talks down the villagers and the rose wilts that night before dawn), and have her declare her love after her return and the beast's explanation, uniting them in a search for a cure. There's a lot you could do with it.

** This isn't really a compelling theory, frankly. In the story (as in real life) love exists. It has quantifiable effects, especially when shared.

Belle feels honest love for the Beast, which breaks the magical curse, as he shares it.

It is certainly possible that Belle would have still earned the Beast's heart if she had not loved him (which, for this to happen, she could not have). It's unlikely, however, that she could have convinced every member of the castle that she felt that love (especially without the empirical evidence of the curse breaking).

There's no real understanding of Belle's character or psychology displayed here, no explanation of why the castle's inhabitants (who still showed every sign of possessing free will) would act as they are portrayed. I find it much more likely that Evil Belle would have 'accidentally' suffocated one night when her mattress mysteriously flipped, or that a 'tragic' fire in the kitchen would have been her undoing. The animated objects were servants, not slaves, and would have been unlikely to serve an outright abusive mistress.

** Belle's antagonist is Gaston. A man who is intent on having her, but who belittles her and is guaranteed to be emotionally abusive, likely to be physically abusive, and rather certain to restrict her from her hobbies. This is his modus operandi during normal, unstressed living.

Beast is an alternative. He is not a great alternative. He is abusive during stressful situations. We don't know whether he is abusive during non-stressful situations, but his behavior toward Belle seems to match his behavior toward his servants, who seem to think it's his condition causing his violence and attitudes. There is a reasonable chance that he will be kinder and less dangerous when the curse is lifted, though the circumstances leading to the curse are not a heartening sign.

Most importantly, he seems to accept some level of independence from Belle, and he is willing to listen to her advice and humor her. In good circumstances, he is likely to be almost a partner. Gaston, on the other hand, would be a neglectful owner at best.

If Belle is widowed, Gaston (given his misogyny and his society) will possibly see her as spoiled goods. This may cause him to leave her alone. However, if she controls an estate, that might draw Gaston's attention in a different way -- the tables might be turned all too readily, and Belle might not survive that wedding night.

Belle was not short-sighted. She saw a man who would be as abusive as she would normally expect but whom she could manipulate, a man who could serve as her protector. She had a strong interest in his survival and did what she could to realize that. Her situation was far from ideal, but she acted well under her constraints.

*** I would argue that the general theme of the film was that Beast's attitude improved dramatically after he saved Belle from the wolves and she showed gratitude; as the song goes, there was "Something there that Wasn't There Before". He was spoiled, selfish, and unkind in the backstory, and grew angst and frustration from his curse, but as he and Belle spent time together, he gained affection and a willingness to compromise and control his temper.

I agree with your assessment in that he was /obviously/ a better option than Gaston of course, and that she acted at least reasonably much of the time, if not optimally. I merely pose objection to your somewhat harsh treatment of Beast's character post-character-development.
