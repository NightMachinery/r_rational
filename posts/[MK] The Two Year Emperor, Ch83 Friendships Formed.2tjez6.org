** I hadn't thought of it earlier, but it seems like the FLEA would make most saves nearly automatic.

The bonuses from ability scores would cancel each other out on offense and defense, but there would only be +9 to the DC from casting a lvl 9 spell vs. +30-50 saves from being level 80.

*** Yep, pretty much. It's inconvenient from an authorial POV.

**** Well, the best spells always were those which didn't offer saves.

The best first action in a combat between 80th level characters is likely a celerity followed by multiple twinned, maximized, empowered, split-ray energy drains quickened for... carry the three... 72? negative levels if all three rays hit. No save, just lose all your half decent spells, most of your HP, and get a -72 to everything.

Probably add a disjunction or Wish first to autodispel any Death Ward effects.

***** No metamagic, remember? But, yes, in a regular 3.5 campaign that would be the best option.

In 2YE-verse, I think the best move might be the Piranha Death Trap -- Celerity, Time Stop, (spent a round shaking off the stun), followed by as many Manyjaws spells as you can manage. Optionally followed by another Celerity, Time Stop, more Manyjaws if you have the slots for it. If you're a 20th level caster you get 10 Manyjaws per spell, each of which does 1-3 no miss damage (assuming the target makes every Reflex save; if not then it's 1d6). It's a 3rd level spell so you can have a whole LOT of them prepared; on average a Time Stop gives you 3 rounds to cast, so if you have filled your 9th level spells with Time Stops you could get an utterly insane number of no-save damage out in one round.

EDIT: Also, it's force damage which can affect extraplanar / incorporeal creatures, and it lasts up to 3 rounds if you concentrate.

** I shudder at how Suze is beginning to switch from "I need a friend, please be with me" to "let's torture all the things".
