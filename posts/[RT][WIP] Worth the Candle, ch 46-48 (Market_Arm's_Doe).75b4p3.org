** This chapter set has increased my confidence that there actually are book-length themes, enough that I think it might warrant a post.

Book I covers up until the newly founded crew leaves the tower they went up, and I would posit that the central theme of that book is Death:

- The primary enemy are +zombies+ undead.
- Juniper administers last rites.
- Juniper gives backstory on his friend Arthur dying.
- For my money, the most "personal" kills happen in this book, as they're with characters who have been onscreen and had dialogue in at least a few instances.
- The nature of the afterlife is given.
- Literal souls are a focus.
- Juniper is left for dead.
- The book begins with Juniper's figurative or maybe literal death, depending on what the true nature of reality is.

Book III starts at the idyllic vacation home, and goes to present, and I think the central theme is Innocence (or maybe Purity):

- The unicorn, obviously, plus all the direct discussions of unicorns and their relationship to purity
- Grak talks briefly about having sex for the first time
- Juniper talks about losing his virginity and/or his first kiss(es)
- Two different D&D group discussions of innocence/purity
- Amaryllis is a virgin
- Fenn talks (very indirectly) about her first time having sex
- Less directly, the Six-Eyed Doe is a symbol of innocence and has magic that (sort of) runs on innocence/ignorance
- Less directly, Cranberry Bay was the first place Juniper made, from a more innocent time
- Less directly, Ropey is remarked to be innocent and pure

I think Book II is a little bit harder to pin down, either because it's less heavy on a particular theme, or because it's something even less specific. My best guess would be something like Cooperation/Defection or similar, but when I try to pin things down it doesn't seem like there's enough evidence without having to stretch, though there certainly things that I could point out on that score.

Symbolism is a little bit weird in this work, since Joon makes the majority of it literal by either claiming to have created it with symbolic intent in mind, or by recognizing the symbolism.

There are also obviously things that don't fit within theme, which are "only" references, digressions, or things like that, but this is my first pass at making thematic sense of the book.

*** I mean, [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] has stated that he doesn't really write with symbolic themes in mind much. That's not to say that such themes are entirely /absent/, or that you couldn't extract any themes from the work if you /tried/, but it's a useful WoG.

**** Well, we have to break it down a little bit, because "theme" and "symbolism" are different but related concepts.

I do write with /theme/ in mind, at least a little bit, because I think of that as just being part of the craft of writing. A story is built of different strands (those of character, plot, and setting), and it's usually better to have those strands working in parallel, because that makes them stronger than they would be on their own, working at cross-purposes. If you wrote a short romance between two people, I would hope that their different circumstances and personalities /somehow/ relate to each other, and that inter-relation then becomes the theme that a lot of the work rests on, whether that's by contrast or complement. Personally, I think that you'll see a lot of authors write on a particular theme on accident, because that's the thing that they care about, and the avenue by which they naturally connect disparate things.

(Some of this comes naturally, which is when I think it's best; characters interact with each other, which reveals their differences and similarities, and the themes arise from that. Or characters interact with the plot, which makes them focus on the things that look like the plot for in-story reasons.)

/Symbolism/ is more complicated. In the sense of "X represents Y", I don't do that at all, because I think that it's hard to do properly without being heavy-handed and figuratively screaming at the audience, "do you see? do you get it?". There's a line about this back in ch 35:

#+begin_quote
  “Ugh, Jesus, please no,” said Reimer. “Please don't ask Juniper to get fancy. You weren't here for when we played Long Stairs, it was supposed to be this neat little dungeon crawl thing where we were army guys going into an endless fantasy dungeon in Oregon, but we just got constantly bogged down in these moral dilemmas and parallels to American imperial jingoism in the Middle East, or something.”
#+end_quote

... but that's sort of it, because sometimes there are /parallels/, which I'm fond of, and you might argue that if things are sufficiently parallel, then one of them is, in fact, symbolic of the other, especially if that other is outside the story. This can be the case when the author is drawing on the real world for inspiration, as I like to do, and as I've often done in the past for D&D. I wouldn't ever do an "X is Jesus" story, but I'm familiar with the story of Jesus, and might us that to inform the story of someone I'm writing about, and maybe that's symbolism, from a certain point of view.

(Now with that said, this story is being written very fast, probably in the top 0.1% of stories by speed, which means that sometimes sacrifices get made, and the deal I made with myself was that symbolism was mostly not worth worrying about, and theme could take a backseat if the plot or characters didn't end up going quite in the direction that I intended them to. So I would expect for people to have to dig a bit for symbolism and theme to be a bit weak, since this is not a story that's been optimized for theme, nor edited down for thematic coherence.)

** There have been a few upward trends in Worth the Candle, so far. Given that I just binged Twig, I have a perspective to offer.

First trend: the number of party members is going up, which is somewhat obvious and expected. Let's hope this one keeps going because while the goldmine of Fenn's interactions with everyone else is far from running dry, further comedy goldmines are yet to be unearthed.

Second trend: every party member is less human than the last (or more nonhuman). First, we had Amaryllis, who's as human as they come, followed by a half-elf, a full dwarf and a six-eyed doe.^{1} I really, really want this trend to continue, because I adore the social strangeness of the non-human characters, and Juniper's sincerity and respect in interacting with them.

Third trend: the number and seriousness of romantic interests within the party has continued to rise. Fenn in particular is getting one romance upgrade after another. As the trends I observe grow more outlandish, my wishes grow more fervent. Please, for the love of all that's good and holy, let Grak become a viable romance option. That would be so utterly awkward and yet supremely heartwarming. I want to see how Juniper would handle Grak's social and cultural properties combined with his biological weirdness.

Also, the doe.

(I'm so sorry for my unrealistic expectations, cthulhuraejepsen. You will now have to live with the knowledge that any reasonable course of character development will disappoint at least one reader.)

--------------

^{1} Both Ropey and Solace mar the strict upwardness of the trend, but then again, they're not really companions in game terms.

EDIT: I guess I should elaborate why I even mentioned Twig: in my opinion, one of the best parts of Twig is that it's the only Harem Romance which I ever liked. (The jury's still out on how much Worth the Candle is going to have a Harem Romance plot.)

**** Have you read Twig? It's following a group of children/teenagers as they grow up and a lot of the focus is on the characters and the character dynamics. There's not a /huge/ emphasis on romance, but it's there and the relationships get messy. And the fandom, being what it is, latched on and made harem jokes and shipping charts, with varying degrees of irony.

(Here's the obligatory message saying go and read Twig if you haven't - it's easily one of the best things I've ever read, though it took a bit to get into it.)

**** I'm partly kidding when I say this. The term "Harem Romance" is strongly associated with Anime, and Twig does not use the corresponding Anime tropes for its relationships.

However, the general setup is similar: the protagonist has /three/ serious love interests. It's not much of a classic "love triangle situation" in terms of drama, but a lot of the romantic tension exists because the main character has some sort of feelings for all of them, which isn't easy to sort out.

**** My personal opinion is that Twig contains a whole lot of neat concepts and character development stuff. I initially disliked most of the characters, but with time, they really came to grow on me (which is when I became invested in the romance aspects).

However, Twig is also way, way too long for its own good. At times, entire arcs passed without anything "noteworthy" happening. Though the plot progressed, there weren't any "high points" which really felt like something. I think Twig would be far better if it didn't follow the structure of Worm so closely... while no arc could have been cut entirely, compressing some of them might have been wise.

So to answer your question: it depends. Are you the sort of person who regularly pushes through, when reading becomes a chore? Did you ever persevere through boring middle books in a far too long fantasy series and feel it was worth it? If you highly value your time, it's likely it won't be.

*** Grak x Juniper doesn't make any sense. Neither of them has shown any physical interest\attraction in the other. Grak looks identical to the classic male Dwarf and this combined with the fact that Juniper is as straight as they come (If he wasn't we would have known by now after so much time spent in his head) makes that romance option unrealistic. I also recall that Joon was disgusted by what he read in the book of blood about Dwarfs intercourse, and I am pretty sure that going from disgust to physical attraction is biologically impossible. Some things are just not meant to be, forcing it would personally ruin the story for me.

**** Let's hope cthulhuraejepsen won't feel forced to do anything because of stupid comments like mine :)

For an interesting fictional exploration of the interplay between disgust and physical attraction, read /Perdido Street Station/ by China Mieville. One of the central characters has a loving (and sexual) relationship with a woman who has a scarab for a head, and his primal disgust fuels his desire for her. In a non-fictional example, many of the less vanilla fetishes are inherently disgusting and some people argue that this is part of what makes them interesting to people.

I'm not saying that it would be a likely development in our case, but I think calling it "biologically impossible" reaches a bit too far.

  “Well, that guy is the reason why,” said Fenn. “He seemed normal enough, at least by my standards, or the standards I had then, and it was going well, but when it came time for us to have sex, after I had undressed, he was there between my legs, staring, poking, and prodding.

Waiting and hoping that Amaryllis spots Larkspur before he spots her, and then successfully evades him? Calling out to her and ruining the advantage of surprise in the hopes that everyone can run away?

It's already assumed, since ch 43, that Larkspur has both the power and motive to put out an imperial warrant for them, and might have already done so. This is mentioned explicitly in ch 47, along with a guess at how efficient such actions might be (i.e. not very, given the group's resources and a rudimentary level of paranoia about checkpoints).

**** Juniper may not have had much of an alternative (for the reasons you give), but I read the comment made by [[/u/Arganthonius]] as suggesting that Juniper's and Fenn's overt acts of aggression towards Larkspur (and perhaps by extension Anglecynn) provide a perfectly legitimate and legal reason for Larkspur to launch a very public witch hunt against both of them without any obvious connection to Amaryllis or her disappearance.

Larkspur's first encounter with Juniper was at the Athenaeum of Bone and Flesh. Larkspur guessed Juniper's full name and expressed his belief that Juniper is a "travelling companion" to Amaryllis. His intelligence reports associated Juniper with Fenn Greenglass, and he knew Juniper was at the athenaeum to research an obscure disease from the Risen Lands ("rat rot").

Larkspur's second encounter with Juniper was in the city that is home to the Athenaeum of Speculation and Scrutiny. Juniper was with Fenn. Witnesses would say Larkspur was ambushed by Juniper and Fenn, and perhaps the rest of the fellowship, depending on their involvement. By all appearances, Juniper and Fenn attempted to murder Prince Larkspur, Foreign Security Director of Anglecynn, in cold blood, and did in fact murder Leroy Castillo.

If Larkspur is in the habit of taking a probabilistic approach to guessing Juniper's future destinations, the other athenaeums might be near the top of his list, or at least the other cities in which those athenaeums are located. He might call on the athenaeums or those nations to aid Anglecynn in capturing and extraditing known fugitives, and anyone accompanying them. Places of knowledge and learning become places of danger.

On the first occasion, Juniper gloated to Larkspur: /“My guess is that your powers as a Foreign Whatever don't include going into an athenaeum and kidnapping or killing a random person there. I'm sure that you could make up some kind of story about how I was a dangerous criminal that you tracked down, or something more clever, but there would be an awful lot of witnesses, and my guess is that you're bound by politics just like any other Prince or Princess of Anglecynn is.”/ If the "random person" is a dangerous criminal wanted for murder or attempted murder (or even regicide, if Larkspur is a prince), maybe Juniper has now given Larkspur the power to do exactly that.

I encourage you to ignore all of this if you feel the slightest inclination to do so, as I love your writing and don't want to influence it. The above was just a bit of fun.

I've heard that overeating is a much more difficult addiction to get over than things like alcohol, smoking, or some drugs because you can't just quit eating. You have to eat to survive, so the path to recovery consists of eating enough to survive, sitting down multiple times a day with your addiction, but not overdoing it when you crave it so much. Leveling up in this story is similar. In order to get stronger, to accomplish just about anything, he has to level up.

So, I have a theory about Druids.

What we know about them is: a) It's safe to ask what they can do and b) It's not safe to ask how or profess your disbelief when they actually do it.

That sounds remarkably like a belief-based magic system. A druid can do things she absolutely beliefs she can do, her faith overpowering reality, and if she starts second-guessing herself (which is a possible outcome of questioning) her powers would diminish. And if there is someone actively disbelieving a feat of druidic magic, the conflicting beliefs might cause what Mage: the Ascension calls "paradox", and create a backlash for the caster, which, from Solace's story, sounds like a possible cause for the Druidic demise.

Have Joon actually played anything except D&D and it's improvised variations? World of Darkness is a massively popular system too, so I find it likely he at least researched it and knows about Mage.

My eyes kept being drawn to her ears, which came up into long points.

  ...

  She smiled at me, and whatever she thought I had seen, her smile didn't really help me figure it out, because her teeth looked normal, if a little bit unnaturally white

Chapter 18

#+begin_quote
  She had a towel wrapped around her, leaving her with some modesty. When I looked at her arms, I realized that I had never seen them uncovered. She had keloid scars in precise patterns starting at the joint of her shoulder and running down to the middle of her forearm. They were curlicue, almost organic looking in their shape, but exactly identical on both arms.

Chapter 26

#+begin_quote
  Fenn was slender bordering on skinny, somewhat flat-chested, and not very muscular at all, though you wouldn't have known that if you'd taken a punch from her, because elves laughed in the face of muscle mass, and half-elves at least gave the concept a chuckle. I had thought her scarred arms were pretty, before she'd told me her story, and I still thought that they were pretty, beautiful even, but it was tinted with a sense of “fuck those elves for leaving their mark on you”, and I knew that neither part of that was something that she wanted to hear.

  I liked the freckles on her face, more now after days in the desert than when we'd first met, clustered around her cheekbones and across the bridge of her nose. I liked the shape of her ears, her slightly crooked and inhumanly white teeth, and it was all more than the sum of its parts, especially in the way that she smiled and joked. She was pretty, and I don't want to diminish that by comparing her to anyone.

Joon describes himself in chapter 2:

#+begin_quote
  (I won't belabor my physical description. My friend Greg had once said that I looked like someone had chosen ‘default' for every option in the character creator, which I'd tried to laugh at but cut kind of deep. I wasn't handsome, I wasn't ugly, none of my features were very prominent, my eyes were blue, my hair was brown, average build, average height ... After Greg had made his comment at one of our D&D games, my nickname had been ‘default' for a while, at least until I stopped pretending to find it funny, and even after that my friends would use similar lines to trash talk me, saying that I was “the most generic man alive”, “a white bread with skim milk motherfucker”, or “the human equivalent of vanilla ice cream”. Not that I was any less of an asshole to them.)

And I think we can infer that he's good looking, from varios characters around him. (Tiff makes a comment at one point, and Juniper himself mentions how dumping points into Phy has changed himself).

  An occasional burst of automatic gunfire came from the other end of the street, and in the background I saw the twirling staff falter and then stop altogether as vines grew up from the cracks in the street and grabbed her by the feet.

The ‘her' is grammatically unresolved. Context implies the staff wielder; substituting ‘her' for ‘its wielder' or some such would work.

** First thing I thought, when I woke up, was a possible tracking method. Part of one. Maybe.

Remember that amulet that has one some ancestor of Amaryllis? What if Larkspur got an /old copy of Amaryllis/ at some point, in a similar amulet? It wouldn't be enough to know everything she knows now, but maybe it could figure out her plans with her goals.

On the other hand, the primary reason to be /here/ was because Juniper is dream-skewered. Did that slip out? Otherwise Past Mary has nearly no reason to model the real one here.

...but it would certainly make her angry. Hey, this time she can participate in her own rescue.
