Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Extraplanar powers. There are planes tied to various physical substances and esoteric concepts. You can "attune" to these planes enabling you to to channel material/concepts from these planes, gain various boons from them, gain extrasensory perceptions, and open portals to use them for rapid world exploration (you can physically enter them and then exit at point physically connected to the real world and associated with the plane's concept/material, although you may need boons to survive hostile planes):

First plane you attune to is free. Each additional attunement cost one more point than the last one (so 1 point for your 2nd plane, 2 points for your 3rd plane, 3 points for you 4th, etc.). The first option you pick from each plane you are attuned to is free, but each additional option you pick costs one point. You have... let's say 6 points to work with, although I wouldn't mind seeing builds done with 3, 9, and 12 points also.

Traveling: Planes connect to each other according to esoteric rules that don't quite correspond to movement in 3 dimensions. Time traveled in the plane very loosely corresponds to distance in the real world: A few tens of minutes traveled will tend to result in exits within a few miles and/or that fit the exit definition very well, a few hours traveled results in exits within hundreds of miles and exits that only loosely fit the exit requirements (or tens of miles with exits that vaguely fit the exit requirements), a day traveled can cause you to exit anywhere in the world in very specific locations that only vaguely fit the exit requirements. If you haven't traveled far enough to have a good exit condition location (for instance you entered through the plane of water in the middle of the desert), you either exit exactly where you entered or in a completely random location randomized within 500 miles. It takes a few hours of travel through a plane to each an "adjacent" plane ("adjacency" rules described below for each plane).

The ability to enter a plane is free for any plane you are attuned to, but entry conditions are more flexible if you take the “travel” option. Exit can be done from any plane you are in, but is very random and unpredictable for planes you aren't attuned to, semi-random for planes you are attuned to but haven't taken the travel option, and controllable if you do take the travel option) you have an intuition for where in the plane you need to travel to travel to get the exact exit you want. Travel between adjacent planes is easiest if you are attuned to both of them, doable if you are attuned to at least one of them, and very hard/unreliable if you are attuned to neither of them.

Some of the major material planes:

Fire: An endless realm of flame. Traveling "upwards" eventually takes you to the plane of air. Traveling downwards takes you to the plane of magma. There is gravity and no solid support, but the updraft from the flame can take you upwards unless you minimize your drag in which case you fall downwards. Traveling towards boiling steam eventually takes you to the plane of water (this method is tricky and unreliable). Traveling towards less active fire eventually takes you to a living plane (flesh/blood/wood), but this method is tricky and unreliable.

- Boon: you are immune to damage from heat
- Boon: Exposure to heat reduces your need to breathe, a small fire against your skin is just barely noticeable in the increased anaerobic exercise stamina, being completely engulfed in flame means you don't have to breath at all.
- Traveling: you can open entry portal to this plane wherever you have access to a large fire and can exit to points in the world where there is extreme heat: volcanoes, forest fires, smelters, etc.
- Channeling: you can generate small flames from your hands or mouth. They don't initially need fuel or oxygen but once leaving contact with you they do.
- Channeling: You can heat yourself at will, enough to stay alive and comfortable surrounded by freezing water.
- Sense: you can see infrared, you have a vague sense of distant (10-100 miles) large sources of extreme heat (smelters, forest fires, volcanoes)

Water: An endless and cold ocean. Faintly lit. Traveling in the direction that feels "coldest" will take you to the plane of ice. Travel in the direction that feels hottest will eventually take you to the plane of Fire. Traveling down through the thickest silt eventually takes you to the solid earthy bottom and the plane of Earth.

- Boon: You are immune to crushing pressures and cold (but not freezing) temperatures.
- Boon: You have no drowning reflex, you don't have to breathe when your lungs are filled with water.
- Traveling: You can open portals in water. You can open exit portals to deep locations, at least 200 ft. deep.
- Channeling: you can generate small streams of salt or fresh water from your mouth/hands.
- Sense: You can feel the water in pipes, plants, and living tissues when close. You can sense bodies of water from a distance.

Air: an endless volume of air with faint traces of clouds. Brightly lit from below. You continuously fall in this plane. Directing your fall to the thickest clouds takes you to the plane of water. Directing your fall to the hottest updrafts takes you to the plane of fire. Traveling towards lower pressure take you to the Plane of Vacuum/Void.

- Boon: you can change your air resistance at will, allowing you to control your tumble/movement when in free fall, and change your terminal velocity anywhere from 12 mph to the speed of sound.
- Boon: You are immune to low pressures and wind chill (but not cold in general).
- Traveling: You can open entry portals when wind speeds reach at least 30 mph. You can also open entry portals while falling at your current terminal velocity. You can open exit portals to locations in the upper atmosphere, or closer locations
- Channeling: You can generate a continuous supply of air inside your lungs. Enough to keep you breathing and have a bit to spare.
- Sense:

Earth: Endless caves and crevices occasionally sand, clay, or soil. Unlit. Traveling through the most submerged sections eventually takes you to the plane of water. Traveling to the coldest sections takes you to the plane of Ice.

- Boon: You can mold "earth" ranging from solid rock to loose sand as if they were wet clay, moving them and then sticking them into place in the new shape.
- Boon: You can squeeze through any crevice large enough to fit your head into.
- Travel: you can enter this plane from any underground location. You can exit to deep caves and/or place deep underground.
- Channeling: You can generate various types of common "earth" (sands, clays, soils, and rocks) in your hands at an average rate of a gram a second, in quantities as small as single grains at a time or as large as fist-sized rocks. You can switch types of earth every
- Sense: You have an innate sense of direction and location in caves, able to mentally sense and map them around you for several miles and sense key features such as toxic air, water, and exits to the surface

Ice: Endless crevices and glaciers. Faintly lit

- Boon: you are immune to the cold, even below freezing temperatures
- Boon: you can change the state of water with a touch in large quantities at once (enough to make a person size passage through the ice at walking speed)
- Travel you can enter this plane with a localized drop in temperature: for example an ice old bath. You can exit to place of extreme cold or localized cold: Cold mountaintops, industrial walk-in freezers, etc.
- Channeling: You can cool yourself at will, down to just above freezing. You can cool yourself rapidly enough and precisely enough to be immune to extreme heat.
- Senses: You can sense area of coldness.

Magma: Endless shifting lava flows. Traveling towards updrafts of flame takes you to the plane of fire. Traveling towards where the magma cools takes you to the plane of Earth

- Boons (same boons as Earth or Fire)
- Travel: You can enter through molten metal or Earth. You can exit in any location with molten material (smelters and volcanoes)
- Channeling: You can heat yourself at will. Enough to survive
- Channeling: You can generate molten rock at will, around a gram a second
- Senses: Same as earth

Void/Vacuum: An endless empty expanse with no gravity, no air, and faint light. Traveling towards faint traces of air will take you to the plane of air.

- Boons: you can break conservation of momentum and equal and opposite forces and apply force by pushing/kicking as if there was an invisible solid floor/wall. You can do this once every 10 seconds.
- Boons: you are immune to negative/low pressure.
- Travel: You can enter this plane when the pressure is extremely low (basically vacuum, although a perfect vacuum isn't required). You can exit this plane in low earth orbit, Geo-synchronous orbit, or at a Lagrange point.near earth.
- Channeling: you can create a sphere of vacuum near your hands that sucks away all air.
- Senses: you can sense vacuum. When surrounded by vacuum, you can sense even faint non-vacuum like air.

*** Travel through other planes magnifies the /distance/ travelled through the material plane. Not the time. The distance.

Hmmm. So if I have a way to move faster, then I can cover greater distances...

Right. Let's see.

- Attune to Fire: Free

- Boon: Immune to heat (necessary; also free)

- Boon: Heat means I don't need air (1 pt.)

- Boon: Travelling to locations of extreme heat (1 pt.)

- Attune to air (1 pt.)

- Boon: Change air resistance (can fall at the speed of sound, and steer my direction - free. This should speed up my travel through the Plane of Fire no end)

- Channelling: Lungs always full of air (1 pt.) - might be useful

- Attune to Void (2pts.)

- Boon: Kick off invisible walls to change direction (just to help me steer) - free

Total: 6pts.

Now. I can open portals anywhere where there is sufficient heat, and I can get there very fast - and the distance seems to increase exponentially with in-plane distance travelled.

Suns are pretty hot places... so that means I've unlocked a form of interstellar warp drive, right? If someone can supply robotic probes that can survive (and launch themselves) from near the surface of a sun, we could investigate nearby solar systems...

**** That's going to leave you horrendously deep in a solar gravity well, so you'd need a ridiculous amount of ∆v to get out. For reference, solar escape velocity from the surface of the sun is 617.5 km/s, in other words, 2% of the speed of light. Merely building a rocket which could do that would be impressive, fitting it through your portal would be even more impressive, but then heat-shielding it enough to survive being launched out of a star's corona would be mind-boggling.

A better approach might be to attune to water first (free), then get the water traveling boon (free), the immunity to crushing pressures and cold (1 pt.), the boon to avoid needing to breathe (1 pt.), and the channeling ability to produce streams of water (1 pt.). Then attune to void (1 pt.) and get the immunity to negative/low pressure (free), and finally attune to fire (2 pt.) to get the immunity to damage to heat (free).

Note that the water channeling ability may be underrated. Presumably, it produces a constant volume of water per second, regardless of surrounding conditions like temperature or pressure (so being deep underwater doesn't reduce your ability to produce water). This means it can potentially be quite energetic. If you build a cast iron pressure vessel large enough to get inside of, you could potentially generate a surprising amount of thrust.

For example, suppose each stream normally produces 5 gallons per minute (315 mL/s - moderate to strong flow from a garden hose) initially moving in a cylinder of 3 cm in diameter at about 44 m/s (98 mph, not fast enough for power washing). Now suppose both streams have to pass through a nozzle at the back which is only 0.25 cm in diameter. At this point, you'd have 630 mL/s blasting out the back at 12,834 m/s. The mass flow rate remains the same, but increased pressure increases the velocity of the water by nearly 300x. This would generate a thrust of 8,085 N, enough to lift about 1,800 lb. against the force of gravity. Outfit the pressure vessel with a pressure-rated hatch at the top for an entrance/exit, a very thick glass porthole at the front, a pilot's seat, a few side nozzles and control levers for the pilot to manage steering, some fins at the back to improve atmospheric stability, and you now have a tiny one-man water rocket with infinite fuel.

With the boons I listed, the pilot could open a portals in water. They could then survive navigating from the plane of water, through the plane of fire, through the plane of air, through the plane of void, and then build up impressive speeds in the frictionless void environment to potentially allow for even intergalactic travel in reasonable time frames thanks to the exponential distance benefits of planar travel. When ready to return to the material plane, the pilot can just open the exit hatch, point his hands at each other, and start creating a small glob of water which would encompass the vehicle, then make the entry portal, pass through it, and end up at some distant planet or moon with large bodies of liquid water.

Two-seater rockets of this sort could be used to transport people to such planets and moons to form permanent colonies. Passengers would need to be attuned to water so that breathing and pressure aren't problems, but they'd still have four points they could spend on other things that might be useful for the development of the colony.

***** I think you want the travel void over travel water. Precise control over which Lagrange point you can exit might be more versatile than controlling what body of water you exit for interplanetary and interstellar travel because many planets of interest may not have enough water to use the water travel exit as opposed to exiting in orbit or in a Lagrange point. Other than that, great build!

Oh and I added a bit more to the travel description: The ability to enter a plane is free for any plane you are attuned to, but entry conditions are more flexible if you take the travel option. Exit can be done from any plane you in, but is very random and unpredictable for planes you aren't attuned to, semi-random for planes you are attuned to but haven't taken the travel option, and controllable if you do take the travel option) you have an intuition for where in the plane you need to travel to travel to get the exact exit you want.

Edit: and I forgot to say it, but the water creation under pressure exploit is brilliant.

****** This is true if you have a specific destination in mind scouted in advance with telescopes, and the tech and infrastructure to land and take of... But if things are slightly more primitive and your goal is a colony, the inability to enter without liquid water might be a feature, not a bug. Especially if liquid water is rare. If you travel far enough that the uncertainty of exit covers multiple solar systems, it can act as an automatic search that takes you immediately to a planet in the goldilocks zone, with at least a significantly higher than average chance of having a passable atmosphere. Even better if you can select specifically a salty sea, which more or less requires an atmosphere and water cycle. And if those conditions are rare, that actually makes it easier to make sure you exit in the same place every time having only that option, instead of hundreds of lagrange points and orbits around bodies that cant support a colony distracting you. And you save a lot of mass on only having to go out of and into the sea, which you can do using some ropes, rocks, and cork, instead of having to be able to launch things or survive reentry every time.

Once you have more infrastructure, and other people with specialized builds (specifically water+fire), you should be able to skip all the extra travel steps and travel the entire way between the colonies in the plane of water alone, by frictionlessly shooting a submarine through a tunnel of superheated steam.

****** That works up until you want to go to the surface of the planet with an atmosphere, where you'll quickly find that the fins point you forward even though you'd really prefer to reverse thrust. You crash land, surviving the impact pressure, but you'd be stuck unless/until you can figure out how to repair the rocket without any tools or infrastructure to do so.

In version 2, you could design some mechanism to rotate the body of the rocket relative to the fins, or add a front rocket nozzle with valves for front and back nozzles. This would make it so that the engine points opposite of the fins (towards the ground while landing), and then you'd have to make sure you have a couple of windows to the sides of each rocket nozzle so you can see the ground on approach. That would work right up until you visit a planet with upwards of 1.5 g's of surface gravity. Eventually, while approaching it to land, gravity would exceed your thrust and you'd accelerate uncontrollably towards the surface, ending up similar to the previous situation.

In version 3, you could add a gravitometer and a radar range-finder to estimate surface gravity before making a landing attempt. This version would finally work, as long the instruments are accurate, though all of the added equipment will make the rocket heavier and you'd need a modern level of technology to build it.

I kind of prefer the approach of automatically discovering fairly habitable worlds, and being just about 100% certain of being able to leave at any time.

***** That /only/ opens portals in water, though. I mean, sure, it implies that any world you visit has at least a habitable /temperature/, but the downside is that you might need to get close before you even know whether or not there /are/ liquid-water planets in the target solar system.

And water is one of the easiest things for your colony to get hold of if it's not present (as long as your colony has enough Water channellers); so not having it won't break a colony (assuming that everything else it needs is there).

Water in the volume that modern agricultural/industrial societies require would not exactly be easy to acquire. Remember that huge amounts of water are used in agriculture, as well as for power plants, and for the chemical and extraction industries; water simply used for cooking, cleaning, drinking, and washing is just a drop in the bucket, relatively speaking.

In 2015, the US used an estimated 322 billion gallons of water /per day/ [[[https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/total-water-use-united-states][Ref]]]. At that time, the US had a population of 320 million, so it worked out to about 1,000 gallons of water per person per day. That might not seem so bad at first glance, but let's do the math.

One water-attuned person making water in 8-hour shifts each day (with up to 60 minutes for lunch/bathroom breaks per shift), working 5 days per week, with 15 sick/holiday/vacation days per year would, over the year, produce an average of 2,873 gal. per day (assuming each hand can produce 315 mL/s). So, yes, water-attuned people could theoretically meet water requirements for the US, but it wouldn't really be practical, as we'll see below.

If water-attuned people were the sole source of water, then 35% of the total US population in 2015 would have needed to be full-time water producers, or 112 million people. This is insane, because in 2015 the US only had 121 million full-time workers [[[https://www.statista.com/statistics/192356/number-of-full-time-employees-in-the-usa-since-1990/][Ref]]], since many people are students, retired, stay-at-home parents, infants/toddlers, disabled, imprisoned, etc. Needing to produce all water to be used would obviously be an enormous hindrance, and it's easy to see how that would quickly cut into the ability to make significant economic progress.

******* Hmmmm. Consider that the water used in agriculture doesn't just /vanish/ - there's run-off from fields and so on, much of the water gets trapped in the plants from which it can then be extracted, etc. And with very careful use of the water (I'm thinking almost completely enclosed greenhouses, where water doesn't /leave/ the greenhouse without the head gardener knowing /exactly/ why) you should be able to get by with much lower water usage - at least at first.

Then all the water channelers need to generate is enough to offset whatever is lost to the environment and cannot be recycled.

Let's say that extreme water-scarce agriculture etc. uses 70% of the water that the US uses (I have no idea what the right figure is, but cutting 30% of water use due to extreme scarcity feels possible to me). And let's say that intense recycling efforts mean that only 5% of that water is lost to the environment in the process. (I'm sure it's possible to do better than 5%; my intuition is suggesting that it might be possible to bring it down to 2%, but let's use the more pessimistic figure). This brings you down from 35% of the population needing to be water channelers, to 1.225% of the population (or 3.92 million people out of 320 million). It puts a significant dent in the workforce, yes, but we're no longer looking at 'impossible to found a colony' levels.

**** You didn't manage to squeeze any pressure immunities into your list, so you need to carefully target whatever layer of the sun (or other star) has Earth-atmosphere like pressure but other than that, it should work okay. You will need a heat-resistant probe to take with you. Oh and I thought of another problem with longer periods of travel... any food/water you have can't survive the trip intact. Maybe you could keep some pressurized (to prevent boiling) water inside your probe, but it seems like preserving food against extreme heat is another challenge entirely...,

Still good build. How much more could you improve it with 12 points instead of 6?

Edit oh wait, as the other poster described, your probe will get stuck in the star. So good for probing stars, not so good for interstellar travel.

***** Hmmm - I /could/ swap out my Air plane's "lungs always full of air" in favour of Void's 'pressure immunities'. Food/water will be a problem indeed...

But let's see how long it would take. Without the speed boost from 'air', it would take a few tens of minutes to travel a few miles - let's say twenty minutes for two miles - and a few hours to travel hundreds of miles - let's say two hours for two hundred miles. So, six times longer spent travelling multiplies the real-world distance by 100.

Proxima Centauri, the closest star, is about 2.5*10^{13} miles away. Given exponential travel times, with twenty minutes covering two miles, I get that travelling to Proxima Centauri will take... uh... around four point seven years.

Huh. Food and water /will/ be needed for a trip of that length.

Speed of sound in air is about six times terminal velocity. So that brings us down to about nine and a half months. Will still need food and water.

Hmmm... if I have a friend with attunement to fire (for heat immunity) and ice (to be able to keep a large ice block frozen even in the Plane of Fire) then we can store our food and water supplies inside the ice block... maybe a team is needed, so that there's always someone awake to hold the block cold (and someone else awake to steer and pull us towards the target - we're all connected with fireproof chains, of course...)

** You suddenly and mysteriously gain the ability to convince anyone that sees you that you are the devil.

The ability is active for 666 seconds at a time and has a cooldown of 666 minutes (~11 hours). While active anyone that sees you in person will be instantly convinced that you are the devil, although they can be convinced they were wrong afterwards if you are sufficiently persuasive.

Every 666 hours (~1 month) N new people (where N is the number of 666 hour periods that you have had the ability) must see you in your "devil form" or the ability is turned on permanently until you reach the required amount of people. Note that rollovers from previous "months" count, so 3 people on the first day would last you ~2 months.

*** Build a cult around yourself? Hmm... how much can preexisting religious narratives change what it means to be perceived as “the devil” to someone? If if you indoctrinate your cult members with some specialized doctrine around your 11.1 minute intervals of being the Devil you could convince them of a lot of things.

**** For the average person the only information they gain when they see you would be "That dude over there is totally the literal devil/Lucifer Morningstar/Satan" for as long as they see you.

However, if they lack the foundation to understand that means (eg. they know nothing or almost nothing about Christianity) then they will instinctively know you are the devil and everything the devil represents based on the collective knowledge of Satan of every living human on the planet.

Thus its practically impossible to game or manipulate the information your power gives them without significantly changing the entire religious structure of humanity.

The cult leader idea is good though, and although chancy would have a real chance of playing out.

*** In what exact sense of "you" do they think "you" are the devil? It seems like an easy way to get sympathy would be to pretend you were being /involuntarily possessed/ by the devil for 666 seconds, but that doesn't reflect badly on you the rest of the time. It might even make people hesitate to kill the devil since by doing so they'd also take the life of the innocent being possessed.

**** They believe that the being they perceive in front of them is the Devil, that is all.

Due to the nature of the devil you would indeed have good odds of convincing them that "you" are possessing the body of an innocent person or (after the ability turns off) that the devil just possessed you and left.

Of course, as most people know that the devil lies they might also not believe you at all.

**** Have not, I'll check those out! Uh, I don't really have rec's. It was /kind/ of tongue in cheek, because most of these threads are posed questions/scenarios that the subsequent comments try to solve/answer.

Those are still fun because 100% of the time the shit I come up with is peanuts compared to what some of the comments do haha. But it's still fun to lurk this thread every week!

Edit: premise on those two look really interesting! Thanks for those rec's 🤝🤝
