** Ok, so Tobias tries to use his yerk to recover a Garrett (and it falls because the thing inside Gerrit's head blocks it from doing so). The yerk can't tear through those parts apparently

Tobias isn't comfortable trying the same on Rachel.

What does he have planned next? Something dangerous apparently

**** Definitely. We've seen how Yeerks can improve humans with mental issues such as Tom, and Tobias was explicitly noted to be basically suicidal. At this point he's barely the original Tobias at all- new body, new mind, the only thing that's left is memories.

are we calling the mini yeerks yerks now because that seems like a great idea.

**** Kind of makes you wonder why he went from Madagascar to Finland to then go back to Greece. These countries are... not quite adjacent.

Also, while I'm nitpicking, how is he even traveling by plane? Is he stealing passports? And money, for that matter?

***** They bailed on Madagascar as soon as Tobias left, because who knows what would happen if he got captured or coopted or otherwise interrogated. They went to Finland as a group, and Tobias got back in touch with them there after going through an un-shown-in-text reconnection protocol that satisfied Marco's desire for security (initial steps probably involving electronic communication via several layers of proxy). The whole group was in Finland during the Ax chapter; it just didn't come up because that chapter was sort of location-agnostic.

Traveling by plane is also something that I assume he could solve by any number of means, including both stealing and stowing away, and therefore I just decided not to spend screen time on it and leave it up to the reader. Hopefully by now the reader at least buys that the Animorphs are sufficiently competent to pull it off somehow.

I'm pretty sure yeerks and yerks normally control construct bodies by controlling the control yeerk, which controls the brain. Maninho can't do that for Garrett because his control yeerk is dead.

** The tone of this chapter conveys exactly the kind of effect I was hoping the sharing would have on Tobias. I love how much Maninho's voice /feels/ like Tobias, but after days of being healed by the sharing. (The fact that you can get that across in so few lines of text is definitely one of my top 30 or 40 favorite things about this story.) It occurs to me that the Collaborator model is actually better for the Yeerks' values than the Controller model. Since Tobias's brain is large enough to dominate the bond, Maninho isn't just getting new sensory experiences. He's getting to experience helplessness, trust, compassion (that he's on the receiving end of), and the feeling of human values really seeping into his soul. I bet the Aftran interlude would gone very differently if she'd been a Collaborator shard.

Theory!

From Chapter 50:

#+begin_quote
  (((Counterpoint: the Yeerks had discovered consenting cooperation through general exposure to humanity; the existence of the Animorphs had been essentially irrelevant to that process---)))
#+end_quote

Also from Chapter 50:

#+begin_quote
  “Are there unique properties to the Yeerk-Andalite bond?” we asked. “Are Yeerks more---potent---with an Andalite, than with other species?”

  “Yes.”

  “Reliably?”

  “Yes.”

  “Why?”

  A shrug.
#+end_quote

And from Chapter 35:

#+begin_quote
  ‹No,› we broke in---still sharply, but calmer, with less emotion. ‹Not all at once. Not with one brain. *The /human/ power*---don't you see? Separately---›

  The translator offered up a word.

  ‹---without anchoring one another.›
#+end_quote

And critically, from Chapter 24:

#+begin_quote
  Hork-Bajir, Taxxons---even the Naharans, for all their engineering brilliance---they don't have rich, internal experiences, complex personalities. The first true intelligence we encountered was the Andalites, and they didn't exactly inspire trust and friendship.”

  Essak directed Peter's gaze at me. “Of all of the pools in the Yeerk Empire, *Aftran was one of the only ones---maybe the only one---that could have opened this door*.
#+end_quote

Are humans the first species since the Pemalites to even be /capable/ of consenting cooperation? Every other intelligent race we know about has either a telepathic or physical hivemind, or instinctual personality quirks like extreme megolomania and isolationism, or a lack of internal experience, or an obsession with pursuing a single field like engineering or biology, that precludes the need for trust, cooperation, and love as terminal values in their own right. Too bad Helium didn't think to ask if there are unique properties to the Yeerk-Human bond, or the Yeerk-Human-Andalite bond.

In the mind meld, V3 was genuinely afraid of Ax-and-Temrash; he called them "The beginning of a new ending, a possibility to match his own, not one but /two/---".

And now the species that's essentially a massive API that connects every other intelligent species together has been exposed to the True Meaning Of Friendship. The race is on between V3's unity and Terra's harmony, like Father vs. the Ellimist in canon, to see who's going to gobble up all the minds in the universe first.

  Slowly, the small, gray slug drained out of the younger boy's ear and into the hand of the older, glistening with blood and effluvia. There was a moment of quivering stillness, in which a number of expressions flickered, unseen, across the older boy's face. Then he lifted the hand to his own ear, grimacing at the sharp pain, the dull pressure, the long moment of unpleasantness before the passenger soothed the sensations away.

** The idea that Maninho was made custom-fit for Tobias - maybe as an apology from Terra for Temrash's treatment? - is so sweet. At the same time, that's what Aftran did for its hosts right? Fine-tuning each shard so it better suited the particular host.
