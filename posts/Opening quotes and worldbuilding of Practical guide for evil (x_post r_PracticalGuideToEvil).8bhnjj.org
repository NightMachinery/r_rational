For some time now the quality of the opening quotes dropped.

One of the best thing about the early quotes were world building elements. In this thread we try to specify what world building elements or issues need addressing and write some mock up quotes.

*World-building cues:*

- There is a river flowing across the entire height of the landmass. It's just cutting across, which natural rivers don't do.

- Where is the waterway feeding/draining the lake by Liesse or the Greenskin Marshes? Or is it a stagnant lake? In which case the fact that it is a swamp and it need addressing.

- The western mountains should have some drainage to the east. Perhaps Ankou, Harrow, Hedges, and Holden have redirected them into agriculture enough that they're not visible at this scale?

- Foramen means "hole" in medical lingo

- Daoine is Irish for 'people'

- /Chain of Hunger./ I immagine them being Skaven like entities. Since skaven are the best known (and best in general) rat folk around. Maybe it is not a direction EE wants to go with them but is the most obvious one. The other being rat-king things or the Cerberus rat (rat prince with 3 heads) from the Russian version of the Nutcracker.

- /Everdark/. Maybe a different spin will be put on them but treating them as drows for future references could work.

*Quotes:*

- /Remember kids. After you undo a binding Mr. Demon is no longer your friend./ Warlock at the court of Maleficent II

- /The critical question is this: do Ratlings bones yield more crossbow bolts than the average number of bolts necessary to kill a Ratling?/

- /"Is there a way to stop immigration kingdom Below"/ /"Magma."/

- /"It would be ugly to watch people poking sticks at a caged rat. It is uglier still to watch rats poking sticks at a caged person."/

- /"Our society is a tyranny moderated by assassination."/

- *“See-smell, man thing. Hear us, touch us. We are broken. Many times we die-die. Change bodies to burn and still back we come. Many times, many-many. Again, and again, and again, forever-ever.”
