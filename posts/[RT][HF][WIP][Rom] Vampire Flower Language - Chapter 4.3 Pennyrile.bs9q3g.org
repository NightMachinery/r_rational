** Another short section, expanding a bit more on who Red is as a person.

It also hints a bit about vampire "powers" here: I wanted being a janissary (vampire-feeder) to be 'useful', so taking a page from the rationalsphere/LW/SSC type area, I decided: what if feeding a vampire did everything that nootropics promise in their marketing literature? I thought it was a lot more "realistic" than the "mere" quasi-sexual thrill that feeding vampires gives you in a lot of romantic vampire mythology (though yeah, you still get that here).

So here, (microscopic spoiler for next week), Red doesn't need to sleep (modafinil) and is able to concentrate on the boring novel (ritalin) enough to finish it overnight.

Apart from that, it's mostly more character development for Red, though I think we already knew he was an empathetic sort of guy, and beginning to wonder whether this whole vampire thing is a good idea. I think the stuff about Janet shows up for the first time in this chapter, though.

** That's too short for a webserial chapter, imo. I'd say a 2k word chapter is already not great, but this is only 800 words!

My opinion, anyway. Hopefully you take that constructively.

*** Honestly I mostly appreciate that someone's paying attention :)!

Yeah, I've heard that people like regular updates most of all, so this is my attempt at seeing how that goes. The only natural place to split the chapters is in between scene breaks, and those often work out to be really short or really long.

If people would prefer it, I might go back to the old release schedule (1x ~7k word chapter every ~6 weeks). Since that works out to the same amount of writing output for us.

Here's this chapter's section lengths:

4.1 500 words

4.2 3,300 words

4.3 800 words (this one)

4.4 1,500 words

4.5 1,800 words

Interlude 200 words

Couldn't cut 4.2, but I could maybe have combined this week's with next week's and gotten two ~2,000 word chapters: or bundled 4.1&4.2 and then 4.3-4.5 for two ~4,000 word chapters.

We've got a chapter coming up (I think chapter 6?) that is full of little 500 word sections, which I was tossing up between posting every 2 or 3 days versus combining them into weekly ~1,000 word drops.

Anyway, I think I've talked quite enough about all that. Does anyone else want to weigh in whether they'd prefer a predictable, weekly drop that might be very short, or a nice chunk of 7,000 words every month or two?

**** Short chapters are considered a "cheap trick" that authors use alongside dummy cliffhangers to artificially keep the pacing of a story tight and to keep the reader turning pages. If the chapter is short and vaguely unsatisfying the reader is more likely to read another one. The desire to read another chapter is then taken for interest/engagement, which ends up informing the person's opinion on the novel(especially people who rarely read and normally have difficulty finishing a novel). That's why "page turner" is used so liberally on cover blurbs.

I think the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule][peak-end rule]] describes why this works. Writers are unwittingly exploiting a cognitive bias(probably doing it on purpose with those young adult books nowadays, though).

(not accusing you of this, obviously)

Anyway, I think short chapters are inherently unsatisfying, especially in webserials, and especially(x2) if you don't use those annoying cliffhangers. There are many writers who make a living with short chapters released daily(or multiple times a day, in the case of xianxia/wuxia writers in china), but I don't know of any that do it on a weekly or inconsistent basis. In your case if people are unsatisfied but don't have more to read until next week(or longer) I imagine the experience will not feel positive. I could be wrong, though, I don't know.

My advice is regardless of all that, though. I think if I were in your shoes I would worry less about satisfying/attracting readers and more about maintaining your own engagement so you can keep writing. That's pretty much the only advice that's universally given by professionals to aspiring authors("WRITE CONSISTENTLY!"), so it must be true, right?

***** Yeah, I think I'm finding these short chapters more motivating because they give me a constant feeling of making progress by pushing chapters. If I was releasing full chapters at this rate it'd be one chapter every 6 weeks, and it would be easy to push that out to 7 weeks for example.

Next chapter I'll go back to the old way and see what I like better.

I think in terms of the social media dopamine rush, so far I prefer the old style as I haven't gotten comments on any of the three "sections" of this chapter.

That said, I've noticed that even though I haven't been adding anything to the sections of this chapter, I've been spending more time on writing other parts of the story with this. Maybe any level of consistency will help with this motivation, though?
