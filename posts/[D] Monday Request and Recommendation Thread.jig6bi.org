Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice][Never Die Twice]] bills itself as a story about a necromancer offering solutions to problems that he causes, and while it tells that story well I recommend it here as a story about a necromancer working to secure immortality for all. It's pretty tightly paced for webfiction, and recently finished at a relatively short 505 pages.

It also examines the question of "Do the ends justify the means?", with neither side feeling like strawmen.

*** I liked the story and do recommend. Not sure I agree that it's badly written -- it's arguably just a different kind of story. YMMV but I couldn't put it down.

The primary conflict was between different moral ideals, rather than much of the usual risk of being killed for not having enough power yet that protagonists usually face. This extreme power discrepancy could have been used as a humor premise (and often is, in Royal Road fics), but went in the direction of moral philosophy instead.

I also particularly liked that the author didn't outright take away the win, but did force the MC to acknowledge the terrible cost of the path he took. He actually does lose considerably, it's just that what he loses are bits and pieces of moral high ground. He's also forced to leave his comfort zone as a shopkeeper to fill the new role he's created for himself by winning.

It's a complex story and could have been done badly, or turned into an anti-immortality cautionary tale as most moral philosophy tracts do. Many times we have to be reminded that he's not a sociopath (at least, not the extreme type who lacks kindness and human feeling) because he's so confidently using means that horrify to combat an even more horrifying reality. (I sort of feel like this must be what it's like to work in politics.)

Overtly evil characters as well as well intentioned good people are used as foils. We're also given hints that he'd find our world rather horrifying as well, and that his success may not turn out to be as complete as he hopes.

Could have been harder for him to rise to the degree of power he obtains, there are some shortcuts the author uses to get him there which might feel a little cheap, and his moral struggles are sometimes more tell than show, but I'd say a pretty good story as it is.

**** I don't think anyone argues it's /badly/ written---it's just very explicitly /not rational/. It's not a terrible story by any means, but I imagine this community has a bit different priorities than most when it comes to fiction.

I'm definitely not gatekeeping this recommendation thread, and there are plenty of works getting rec'd here that are not rational, but this is a particularly egregious example, IMO.

*** Finally this story has been posted in this thread again, so I can de-rec it!

Despite a very rational(ist) premise, NDT's actual contents are anything but. Aside from a select few, characters are shallow and act the way the /plot/ requires them to. Many of them build complex, insane plans that shouldn't work---but of course they do, because /plot/. The main character, despite allegedly being a genius, makes abnormally stupid decisions out of sheet stubbornness (you guessed it, to advance the /plot/). And finally, the /P L O T/ itself is unexciting, with many twists and turns coming mostly absolutely from nowhere and others being seen a mile away despite zero foreshadowing.

I also found pacing to be outrageously fast, but that's subjective.

What (probably) isn't subjective, though, is the absolute lack of tension. MC is overpowered from the start and only gets stronger over the course of the story. He gets everything he wants, and, aside from the finale never really loses nor do you /ever/ expect him to. The outcome of every battle and every event is laughably predictable.

This is power fantasy at its worst.

Though I don't know why I expected anything else from Void Herald. He's great at worldbuilding and humor, but otherwise his writing is mediocre, especially for such a complex premise.

**** Some knowledge of the source material is useful and not too painful to acquire (the likeable characters and solid storytelling of the first three seasons are why the 'brony' phenomenon exist[s/ed]). That being said, you can honestly jump into pretty much any alternate-universe pony fic (including the ones I linked above) without much knowledge of the source material besides watching the first episode. Or if even that is too much of the source material for you, here's a quick summary of the salient points:

- The immortal and capricious Princess Celestia rules Equestria with an iron hoof, her control over the motions of the heavens the only justification necessary for her autocracy.
- On the 1,000th anniversary of banishing her usurper sister, Princess Luna to the moon, said sister returns to claim her throne, defeating Celestia and ushering in an age of eternal night
- The 'Mane six' (Celestia's pupil Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack) band together to find and reactivate a set of primeval weaponry known as the 'Elements of Harmony'
- They confront Princess Luna, self-styled as the 'Nightmare Moon' in a forgotten ruin, and vanquish her with the power of the Elements of Harmony and the fell magic it enables, twisting her mind until she consents to the rule of her elder sister.

**** The main work of /Friendship is Magic/ is the show, which is 9 seasons long and has 222 episodes. Then, there is /Equestria Girls/, which is canonical to /Friendship is Magic/ but is deliberately constructed in such a way that it can mostly be it's own AU setting with parallel-universe human versions of the characters that FiM!Twilight occasionally visits. It started out as a series of 4 movies set in between seasons of /Friendship is Magic/ and then started getting specials and shorts and stuff. Then, there is /the/ movie, set between seasons 7 and 8, which is again canonical to /Friendship is Magic/, and there are several shorts and a couple of specials which are canonical to the main show as well. The comics and books you can ignore, since they are A) non-canonical and B) obscure enough that you are unlikely to encounter fanfic based on them. See [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic][the recap article]] on TVTropes for a complete breakdown.

Obviously, watching all this would be a huge time investment, and to be honest not all of it is very good. But the bare minimum you should do is watch the two-part season one premiere, which introduces the Mane Six, Spike, Princess Celestia, Princess Luna, and the Elements of Harmony. That'll take 44 minutes. If you can then watch the rest of season one, you will get to know Gilda, Trixie, Zecora, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, Prince Blueblood, and the Grand Galloping Gala, as well as getting a much better feel for the personalities and relationships between the Mane Six. That's 26 episodes, or roughly 9.5 hours. Season two is not quite as important as season one, but it still introduces Discord, Daring Do, Shining Armor, Princess Cadence, Queen Chrysalis and the changelings, all of which are huge in fanfic. But that's another 26 episodes, so now you are up to 19 hours of viewing time. And /then/ there is season three, which is short (13 episodes) and has some of the weakest writing so far, but includes King Sombra, the Crystal Empire, and most importantly, the season finale "Magical Mystery Cure" which introduces a huge change in the status quo and was obviously intended to be the series finale if the show didn't get renewed (see [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixtyFiveEpisodeCartoon]["65-Episode Cartoon"]]). So that's the most obvious natural stopping point. Unless you feel like watching the first /Equestria Girls/ movie, set immediately after season 3, which introduces Sunset Shimmer, Flash Sentry, and humans.

*TL;DR:* Seasons 1-3 of /Friendship is Magic/ and the first /Equestria Girls/ movie are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle][the 20% of /My Little Pony/ that will let you understand 80% of fanworks]].

** I've been reading a lot of fantasy fiction (both classical Western, LitRPG, and xianxia) lately, and I've noticed a gap. It seems like all magic systems in these works assume that magical "resource gathering" is something that occurs over a long time, such that all these gathered resources can be whipped out and expended all at once in a time of need.

Is there a ratfic (or just any fiction that's not irkingly irrational) that explores the alternative --- magical "resource gathering" being something that needs to happen /during/ battle?

Y'know, like what happens in a match in an RTS/4X game; or the "mana ramp" in a TCG like /Magic: the Gathering/.

A magic system where everyone has to "start at power-level 1" at the beginning of a fight (unless they've already been ramping up in anticipation --- which probably has negative consequences, otherwise everyone would do it.) And where you can only build up your power level to "unlock" your higher-level techniques so quickly during a match, unless you've specialized in arts that accelerate mana ramping, at the expense of your other powers. Basically, a narrativization of something that is, at its core, a /deck-building/ magic system. (Though it doesn't have to look that way to the people in the setting.)

I'd expect this would mean that high-level techniques only have a point to learn, if you've already mastered your low-level arts to the point that you can reliably "win up to" the point in the mana ramp where high-level techniques become relevant. The first exchange of every fight would always be decided with only low-level techniques on both sides, and so even the most mysteriously-gifted would be "balanced" with raw apprentices for the first few rounds.

All that being said, I wouldn't want to literally read rational!YuGiOh. I'd prefer a story with a "real" high-fantasy magic system, not a story about people playing a game where the deck-building magic system is a property of the game.

--------------

Or, for an alternative thought, couched in economics: what about a magic system where people work like corporations? Where instead of just having to worry about "capital outlay" (equiv. to spending mana / artifacts in a fantasy battle), they also have to worry about "operational expenses" / "cashflow" (equiv. to something more like "a need to breathe" --- a constant consumption of an environmental magical resource, whose flow can be blocked or redirected, and where increasing in power level can increase this "burn rate.")

Anyone here know anything /good/ in this vein?

*** I'm not aware of any magic systems like that, but I can think of a few reasons why authors don't use systems like that. For one, it makes ambushes extremely effective. If a handful of apprentices start gathering energy a minute before they plan to fight someone, they have an overwhelming advantage against even a master. The faster that power scales over the short term, the bigger advantage you give to people who can start gathering power before a fight actually starts.

Another problem is that if you have some limiter on the staying at your maximum power that's strong enough to be a real dettriment, then you really limit the types of combat encounters you can have. Wars of attrition would be difficult to write, because there's only a finite time that your protagonist can maintain their stronger spells before burning out. I think there's ways around it, but it gives a large advantage to anyone who can hold out even just a tiny bit longer, or who has some weapon in reserve for when your protagonist doesn't have their defensive spells anymore.

Mundane weapons are going to be a big problem, because they definitely don't have the limitation of starting out weak. If even a master mage can be brought down by bows within the first few seconds of a fight, you're placing some hard limits on how useful a combat mage can be.

I don't think any of these problems are insurmountable, but it's sufficiently limiting that it isn't a very attractive method of writing your world. You /have/ to deal with issues like this, because otherwise your world can look shoddy for ordinary people not thinking of it, and measures you take to correct for the above can have world building or plot consequences.

#+begin_quote
  For one, it makes ambushes extremely effective.
#+end_quote

My naive assumption was that stories in a setting like this could employ something like MtG's old concept of [[https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Mana_burn][mana burn]] --- wherein any spiritual energy that is gathered /must/ be released within a few seconds through the use of some art (with no option to simply "put it back" or "bleed it off"), as not doing so results in backlash damage proportional to the amount of energy that was gathered.

Essentially this spiritual energy would work like an electrical grid: power generation gets spun up to meet demand, but if power generation ever greatly /exceeds/ demand (plus storage capacity), bad things happen.

Or, in the small: a magic-user needs to put a "load" on the spiritual-energy "circuit" they're creating, or it'll be a /short/ circuit, grounded through them :)

This could be made even more strict by removing the ability to decide /how much/ energy you'll be gathering at any given point --- you'd be on a set mana ramp, that you can only influence by choosing to "step on the gas" or not each turn. By analogy with MtG, it'd be like as if lands auto-tapped every turn you had them in play. You can only choose whether to play a land or not each turn; but you then have to spend your mana "income" for the turn, or face backlash. Which, of course, would be just /awful/ in combination with a mana-burn mechanic in a deck-building game where you aren't sure what cards you're going to be able to play; but would mostly work just fine in a story setting where wizards just /know/ their spells, and can cast them whenever, energy allowing.

(What happens at the end of a magic battle, then? Maybe it'd possible to just reset your mana ramp back down to zero at any time. That'd mean people would have a lot of tactical flexibility to ramp up and down between 1 and 0, but would lose that as they ramp higher. /Or/ you could /not/ do this, and presume the setting is full of passive abilities designed to burn off the excess energy high-level magic-users are stuck permanently consuming now that they've ramped up to that point---perhaps with global environmental consequences. Both options seem "fun.")

Well, sure, but those are the same limits D&D places on its Wizards, just in microcosm. "Can't survive on their own and must be defended; but gradually gain self-sufficiency; until eventually they're an invincible nuke" --- but it happens over again every battle, instead of being their lv1--lv20 growth arc.

Personally, I'd love to see a story about such a combat mage /and their bodyguard/. Seems like a fun character dynamic. Somewhere between a buddy-cop comedy and /KonoSuba/.

(Alternately, it could be a highly team-based setting, where mages cover one-another in shifts like real tactical squads, with some mages "taking watch" by ramping up to a set level where they can run wards / summoned mooks / etc., where someone else is supposed to ramp up to the same point in time to cover them so they can reset and go to sleep; all to protect some /other/ mages so they can be kept fresh for actual fighting.)

Then it's just a game of finding the stealthiest method of burning mana while you wait to ramp up in power. And like I said in the last paragraph, it has a lot of knock-on consequences that an author may or may not like. In a fight, your mage protagonist is locked into burning mana very frequently. There's not a good way to reposition, or pause to talk about your conflicting ideologies, or help your teammate: you are locked into casting spells or you basically forfeit the fight.

#+end_quote

It's not a good dynamic. The D&D version is fine, because you're sacrificing being weak early game in order to scale super well, but going through that scaling for every fight is super bad. Other people will know about you being extremely weak when you're just starting a fight, they will know that mages get unstoppably strong after a minute or so of fighting, so in every fight against people who know about mages they will immediately open with lethal force against the mage to the exclusion of any other fighters. They don't have a good option to deescalate, because even pausing to try to talk gives up time where the mage is growing stronger. Ambushes using mundane weapons would work very well.

Using multiple mages to cover each other can work, but especially combined with the above part about spending mana, stealth isn't an option.

If you have your mage in a more traditional adventuring group, maybe they can cover for you instead, or stealth isn't as important. But in a mixed class adventuring group, a mage that ramps up in power really quickly over the course of a fight is going to be a liability in the start of every fight (not a terribly fun thing to write about consistently) and then either match up with the rest of the party or eclipse them. It's not unworkable, but you're going to have a tricky time balancing it, and you have the rather inherent part that isn't fun in every combat.

Again, the idea /can/ work, and it can maybe even have some neat dynamics, but it opens up a lot of problems you need to solve, when you could just go with the much more traditional systems of magic that do what you want with far less effort. Even if mages in other works can accumulate power over time to be front loaded in a fight, it's very easy to add limitations on how quickly they can actually dish out magic, or have some other very simple limiter that makes them not want to do that. Rate limits on spellcasting, difficulty in multitasking, expending resources that are slow/expensive to replenish. These are all very simple to do, and have much easier methods of slotting into your world building and plot. They're far less restrictive as well, in contrast to the first point about how limited your options are if you have to expend your mana as you generate it.

I was also presuming that stealth was kind of impossible, in the sense that there is some sort of spiritual-energy field that everyone could feel "flowing" toward mages as they consume it. A sensation like being in a full bathtub near an open drain. You can't necessarily tell what they're spending the energy /on/, but you /can/ tell that energy is being removed from the environment, and at what rate, and a general sense of what direction it's going.

#+begin_quote
  after a minute or so of fighting
#+end_quote

Who said anything about that sort of time-scale? I mean, that's a possibility, but I was picturing /hours/, not seconds, of ramp time.

As a good example of what I'm picturing, a fictional character that already basically has this sort of built-in "per-battle mana ramp" (but where this is just a trope, not anything built into the constraints of the setting's magic system per se) is /Dragonball/'s Goku.

Goku, by the end of the /Dragonball/ franchise (~past /Super/), is a veritable Matryoshka doll of power-up transformation sequences. Every time he is in a fight, he essentially has to go through all of them, in sequence, if he wants to get to the highest one.

Goku gains long-term strength in two ways --- by unlocking new power-up levels, yes; but also by /decreasing the refractory period between each successive pair transformation sequence steps./ (These periods start out quite long; by the end of the franchise, he's whittled the early ones down to be near-instant, but the top-end ones are still slow.)

In most fights, Goku never /makes it/ to the top level he's theoretically capable of performing at.

Mind you, Goku is /already/ quite strong in his default state, even at the start of the franchise; but he's weaker than everything he has to fight. He starts out, as a child, needing to use cunning against most opponents until he can get his ramping-up technique of the day in.

Also keep in mind, Goku's base level of strength /also/ increases over time. I think this makes sense as a general principle; though I wouldn't recommend copying /Dragonball/'s own decision to make this base strength actually fully keep up with other characters' fully-empowered power levels.

I feel like the best approach to long-term growth would be to have this type of character be always be /slightly/ weak "at base level" compared to their non-ramping comrades, but not /terribly/ weak compared to them. Someone the party always has to /protect/ --- but not someone who's actually getting /proportionally weaker/ compared to the threats they're facing over time.

Also, importantly, both Goku and MtG planeswalkers can /take a hit/ from a top-level threat, even when they're not ramped. In D&D terms, they continue to have per-level HP and natural resistance/armor class growth, even though they don't have (as much) base-state DPS growth.

***** I feel like this idea would only really work if you exclusively had offensively-focused magic that must target another creature. Since you brought up D&D, I'll use D&D spells as examples; it's a bit of a problem if you have to use Meteor Swarm or be mana burned, but less so if you can repeatedly cast Invulnerability on yourself. Once you include buffs/utility spells, there's no real downside to keeping ramped up.

Unless there's spell slots as well, like in D&D. But then with the ramp up all wizards would burn through their low-level spell slots pretty quickly and be unable to ramp up effectively as they'd have nothing to burn off mana while ramping up.

***** The issues being discussed might be worse for pure mages who only use magic, as opposed to some kind of mix of combat abilities. This makes sense for tabletop games where specialisation and build decisions are key, but less so in real life or a story where skill, situation, and character development add variety to combat even if everyone's build is "some mix of weapon skills and magic".

But to answer OPs original question: One of the 3 paths of magic in Polyhistor Academy is like that. It suffers from the ramp-up issues and ambush problems, but that's the trade off for increased flexibility and endurance (as opposed to raw power)

*** Since the problem of ambushes was bought up, the solution to that could be detection - the first magic skill mages learn is working out the amount of power someone has access to at any moment, meaning any time a mage gets antsy and draws in mana, they get revealed to everyone else around them, and suddenly any surprise is measured in milliseconds.

That brings up interesting specialisations in development for mages, with ramping speed, ramping cap, and effectiveness with the lowest power level of spells. Additionally training of detection range versus other magic skills is a trade off, since a powerful mage could theoretically train as a sniper.

The left-field solution is that any mage can detect any other mage at any time, regardless of held power, meaning stealth isn't an option, but that also means a sufficiently powerful mage can round up all the weaker/in-training mages easily before they grow to oppose them and act as a magic dictator.

  Or, for an alternative thought, couched in economics: what about a magic system where people work like corporations? Where instead of just having to worry about "capital outlay" (equiv. to spending mana / artifacts in a fantasy battle), they also have to worry about "operational expenses" / "cashflow" (equiv. to something more like "a need to breathe" --- a constant consumption of an environmental magical resource, whose flow can be blocked or redirected, and where increasing in power level can increase this "burn rate.")

The City And The Dungeon has something a bit like this.

There is a dungeon. People can become basically immortal by becoming adventurers. The catch is that you have to constantly consume monster cores to stay alive. Monsters drop these cores in the dungeon. The drops go up in quality the deeper into the dungeon you go, but the dungeon also gets much harder. As a person levels up they need high quality monster cores just to survive.

There are a few mentions in the book of the city rulers trying to balance population levels based on the amount of loot that people can pull in. In general there were a few interesting bits of exposition about the economics of the world.

Some Shounen is very much like this system in specific reminds me a lot of Saint Seiya.

They need to ramp up during a fight, low level techniques are used at the start as bread and butter and later ultimate techniques como into play as finishers. A talented low level/class can get to the same level as a high level with enough burning time/buffs like Athena's blessing.

Also they have some build-in counters to the downsides for example they use heavy armor used as protection while ramping up and main difference between low and high level users is that high level users have a faster ramp up, their low level techniques are more powerful versions and can maintain the peak performance for longer (during battle) but in theory both can reach a similar ceiling.

Magic require huge expenditure of resources, and mage casting spell is merely the end point of long pipeline of resource gathering and processing done by organized labor force. Social consequences would be the mages are not necessarily absolute top of the social pyramid. Another would be "mages don't fight mages if possible".

**** Interesting. You're basically just talking about the D&D conceit of Artifacts --- which are cheap to /use/, but do indeed require state-level resource expenditures to /create/. (The high-level D&D wizards who create Artifacts, have access to state-like levels of resources.) What you're proposing is a magic system where the /only/ type of magic, is Artifacts. You need to use Artifacts to build other Artifacts.

(Sort of like computers before microcomputing!)

Still not sure that that would imply a need for state-scale /manpower and logistics/, since this would still be a world with literal /magic/. One thing magic systems almost always enable is /logistical automation/. In every high-magic setting I can think of, high-level wizards can, and do, go around setting up resource extraction operations to feed their spellcasting resource requirements all on their own, with magical "machines" taking the place of manpower. (And, in many systems, much of the "casting" of a long-casting-time spell is implied to be a sort of bootstrapping phase where other spells are cast that set up or redirect resource-extraction to feed the final spell.)

In other words: imagine /Factorio/, but fantasy instead of sci-fi. That's what high-level mages are usually running around doing to the countryside.

*** While I don't think this is viable as a way for all combat in a setting to work, there are ways you can contrive to make it happen regularly. The obvious one is sports. Another is thresholds past which a mage can't bring any mana, so they have to use techniques to build power on the other side. This lacks the fundamental symmetry sports has, so you would have to balance it by penalizing lack of initiative to the point that the opponent has to mobilize in response to an invader. So a mage could invade a pocket dimension occupied by a demon, and would have to take control over the dimension's mana before the resident demon mobilizes it against them.

All wizards have a capability ("vocation") that they are natively good at, usually right off, but other wizards can learn other people's vocations if they have the background and talent. The fights are pretty cool, you have people fighting it out each with 1 major power a, 0-2 medium-sized powers, and an assortment of minor but relevant powers like pattern recognition or "nidging" unprotected minds.

The premise is that the author inserts into Tahno in Legend of Korra before the main plot starts. Starts with some of the more annoying SI tropes but after a bit turns into a genuinely good story. Not very rational, but fun and sometimes funny too.

Another story I've been enjoying a lot is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29027/a-city-stranded-cowboys-robot-mercy-killing-business][A City Stranded Cowboy's Robot Mercy Killing Business]]. The story is every bit as absurd as its title, but it's really funny at times and the world is very interesting. The closest thing I can compare it to is John Dies at the End by David Wong, without as much body horror. The premise is also pretty out there, so I'm not gonna spoil it for you. Just be ready for some absurd humor.

** I just read Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past (From the previous week's rec thread? I don't remember.). It was the best time travel HP fic I have read, and generally one of the best fanfictions I have read; It's incomplete and abandoned (though the author said 6 months ago that they are going to continue it and there was one new chapter in the last two years), but it covers the first three years, and a bit of the fourth year. Its not exactly rational, but does not have big, jarring irrationalities, either. Overall, I'd say it's rational-adjacent-adjacent.

PS: I'd love to hear HP fanfic recommendations. The other good ones I remember and enjoyed (pretty much all of them irrational):

- Delenda est
- Black Comedy
- Dimension Hopping for Beginners
- An Unforgiving Minute
- The Lie I've Lived
- Prince of Slytherin (Probably just the first two years? The story is very irrational, and gets more so as it progresses; But I really enjoyed it till the middle of the third year.)
- Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth is
- Timely Errors
- Seventh Horcrux
- Poison Pen (rather more mediocre)

*** I've really enjoyed Blood Crest.

I think it's biggest selling point is that there doesn't seem to be a true authority on magic. Capable and powerful wizards all seem to have different and sometimes mutually exclusive ideas on how to go about practicing magic, which does the best job I've seen of creating an atmosphere of scientific inquiry.

Furthermore, although it does a great job of creating that aforementioned atmosphere of inquiry, it hasn't really explored the different avenues in tremendous detail yet.

My memory is pretty hazy, but I feel like 3/5 of the way through wouldn't be a terrible estimate? If you're not interested in what's there so far, this one trait which I particularly liked might not be enough to sell you on the whole story.

*** I looked at the stories I read of Harry Potter fanfiction, and here are the ones I remember enjoying:

Realignment: "The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about."

The Many Deaths of Harry Potter: "In a world with a pragmatic, intelligent Voldemort, Harry discovers that he has the power to live, die, and repeat until he gets it right."

Magicks of the Arcane: "Sometimes, all it takes to rise from greatness is a helping hand and an incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now."

The Firebird Trilogy: Firebird's Son - "He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How could one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe."

The Denarian Renegade: "By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artifact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight crossover with Dresden Files."

Almost a Squib: "What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successful in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly, AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning Harry."

Final Battle, Pokemon Style: "Wild VOLDEMORT has appeared! Go, HARRY!."

Harry Potter, the Geek: "The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

Weeb: "Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Timeline moved to the modern day."

** I've 2 recommendations this week, one is a series called [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7826376/][Upload]]. People here would probably love it, it's near future scifi with a bit of pop culture thrown in which leads to really fun things like kids doing homework on 2013 songs they call classic dance and other silliness. It's a comedy, has transhumanist tendencies and it's from the same creator as The Office and Parks and Recreation. It's great and you should watch it. The only Con I can think of is that the MC isn't very relatable to most people.

​

The second is a short book I read on screenwriting and writing stories in general, some of the points from it have been really helpful to me as an aspiring writer.The tittle is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49464.Save_the_Cat][Save the Cat]], it has tips on how to make characters likable, how to pace the story, how to give characters distinct voices and personalities etc. If this is something that interests you check it out.

*** Upload uses it's premise of Transhumanism as a play set for its comedy and commentary on wealth inequality, vapidness, and a few jabs at the question of what it means to be alive. Which is kinda funny give Amazon is the one footing the bill for it.

The Uploads don't age, have to pay for micro-transactions every day, can't duplicate themselves, and are not even aloud to participate in the economy at even a creative level, let alone a productive one. The few attempts at 'hacking' into the uploads environments is all for laughs, and the administrators for the system have enough power / control to casually modify uploads memories.

This is a Comedy, borrowing a sci-fi concept to re-iterate on without adding anything new. It's an alright comedy. The Orville is the most recent similar setup I can think of, and that show does a good job blending the familiar sci-fi elements with new ideas to keep them fresh.

**** I think this is actually the case. It was a popular book, and it really goes into detail (if I remember correctly) about what part of Cambell should happen on what page. If you didn't want to write to a formula, you would read Hero with 1000 Faces. I really hate the example from the title (make your hero save a cat at the beginning to make them relatable or whatever), it's just so shallow.

From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Snyder's nonfiction book Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need was the number one selling book among screenwriting manuals on Amazon and in 2018 is on its 34th printing.[10] The book describes in detail the structure of the monomyth or hero's journey, providing a by-the-minute pattern for screenwriting.[11

You might be able to get something useful out of the book, but it has certainly had a wide influence, and it's designed to be followed exactly, and that's probably how it was used.
