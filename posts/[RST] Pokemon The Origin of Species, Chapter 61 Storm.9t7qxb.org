** I don't who I'm more suspicious of, Tony or the family. On the other Tony seems pretty shady, and doesn't seem to be that connected to anyone else.

Still, there's A Strom Bird attack going, Pokemon are rampaging through the streets, people are dying in what is undoubtedly one of the greatest natural disasters people in this universe have to face... and when Red suggests moving the group somewhere safer, somewhere where they have less chance of dying, the woman hesitates because "customers aren't supposed to go there"?

At first I was like "incredibly suspicious, have Red and Leaf just saved the lives of some kind of illegal Pokemon smugglers or something?" But then I realized that Pressure can account for almost all the weird behavior in this chapter, making it all so ambiguous. I guess it's not about getting to a shelter before the storm starts; the only real way to truly be safe is to be perfectly safe and coordinated, before the Pressure hits.

Is Tony secretly some kind of looter/Storm Bird profiteer, or is he just a vaguely awkward guy who get hit by the Pressure when he as asleep and woke up emotionally altered? Is the mom secretly working for a shady criminal business that takes secrecy so seriously she would rather risk death than take outsiders into the offices, or was the Pressure just amplifying her rule-abiding tendencies, jut like it upped Red's fear or Leaf's sadness?

I didn't realize it, but Storm Bird attacks are probably so destructive not only because it's a physical god coming down to wreak havoc, but also because it directly attacks people's ability to act rationally on level beyond that of other natural disasters. Truly the perfect storm for a rational story :)

That sort of thing does happen in emergencies as most people don't have much emergence preparedness training and a habit formed over years doesn't easily go away in minutes of being in a situation with drastically different priorities. In this case she's probably not used to thinking of buildings as "fragile" nor of dealing with "you and your son will die" as the stakes.

** I'm excited to see how the gym leaders deal with these stormbringers. This IS a rational fiction, so you have to make those things pretty damn powerful for them to rationally be a threat to these towns. We know gym leaders do be ridiiiiculously strong, we know a lot of the big name trainers in this story are very high level and we know a lot of them are going to be in Vermillion. You can't have it be like how it is in the games or the show where Legendaries can be matched by some pokemon, a lot of fully evolved pokemon in the games are pseudo-legendaries. And there are expected to be dozens of trainers in this city with pseudo-legendary level pokemon, with the leaders having even more. I don't think the pressure and stampedes are enough to explain how these stormbringers can reap so much havoc if they are indeed able to be matched by more common pokemon. If Leaf and Red can survive without any pokemon that are even close to that level, I think the stampede might be more manageable as well. You can just set up a perimeter, have pokemon guarding it who can trap the runners (maybe a wall, a psychic type, paralysis), and then capture them. You have a rough idea of what pokemon are going to be coming, you know the composition of the waves (starts with rapidash, then come the nidorinos). The flying pokemon are harder to manage but even they aren't as much of a problem, they might be more vulnerable to paralysis though.

So in essence I'm curious to see how it is explained that nobody's just went up and killed the things yet. Sure, killing a legendary might be tough, but everything I've seen so far indicates that the humans have the fire power to do it. I mean they have the fire power to get into wars with weapons that can level cities, Zapdos would have to be one hell of a monster if it's really survived this long.

*** Even without whatever additional tankiness Daystar gives it, and even with the worst of the lightning drawn away by lightning rods: Zapdos is fast, doesn't necessarily fly low enough to be in range of the meatiest hits (and best of luck trying to /fly up/), has a freaking Category 5 Hurricane surrounding it, brings along a bunch of powerful rampaging pokemon not fast enough to get out of its way, and of course has a fear aura that throws off even the most seasoned of trainers and fucks up any sort of clever subtle plan (and limits the number of times the best trainers can actually help out; gym leaders/elites probably need to "ration" their assistance and can't just all show up to every encounter). It's one thing to have the firepower, it's quite another effectively deploying it in conditions that stacked against you.

**** Okay but even that just assumes it always stays in the air. And I believe the war scene showed that anti-air artilley pokemon do exist, and we know rock pokemon would be the most effective at that. Get a pokemon with lightning rod to absorb the lightning and out number him in terms of long ranged projectiles. He can kill all of your pokemon, you only need one hit with a status effect. Ice beam, rock throw, gunk shot, hyper beam, fleur cannon, moon blast. If he dives once, he dies. There's no way a Zapdos can challenge an army of Rhyperior and Nidokings on the ground.

And I still do not consider the pressure or the rampaging pokemon to be significant enough to stop this. If it was doable, there would be one trainer good enough to pull it off through the pressure. There would be at least one instance where someone distracts the rampaging pokemon long enough to set up the kill. If this thing can be killed, it would be dead. And if Daystar wants to write about it dying, he needs to come up with a very good reason how Blue or Giovanni were able to kill it when centuries of people before them were not.

***** Well there might be a reason it's not possible at all which will be explained in the future, like Legendaries being sort of avatars ("gods" with a lower g) created by Arceus himself who can't die at all. Also you're seriously underestimating Zapdos or any other Legendary pokemon. Sure an army of pokemon with Lightning Rods might be able to completely neutralise its lightning, but what about the Tier 5 Hurricane surrounding it due to which most attacks (Rock Throw, Gunk Shot, Ice Beam, Moon Blast etc) AND most pokemon can't even reach it at all. How is an army of Rhyperior gonna do shit if they can't even land their attacks on Zapdos. Also the Pressure affects everyone, even experienced Gym leaders and Champions which is messing up their strategy (like how Leaf is too passive and Red is too afraid, and while they might be fine with solo plans, but Pressure hampers their teamwork even more due to them wanting to do different things) combined with every person experiencing worse Pressure effects the more they encounter these Legendaries - even the legendary champ Prof. Oak can't deal with its effects now after 10+ encounters, with him near sure to die next time they come near him. Also even if they're not immortal or anything, their durability is probably still through to the roof compared to normal pokemon or even Pseudo-Legendaries trained by Champions.

So there are no moves that are long range enough to reach Zapdos? And still, you're assuming that the bird always stays in the air and only fights from range with lightning. If it goes near the ground, it gets ripped by the Ryperior.

I would be somewhat satisfied with this explanation as well. For now, that's just speculation. All I'm really asking for is a bit of a clearer demonstration of how nutty this thing is if hasn't been killed yet.

A thrown rock in a hurricane is not going to to be bothered much by the hurricane. Especially if that rock is thrown by a Tyranitar or by Brock's Onix. And we've seen anti-air military style pokemon in the war chapter, stepping that up to a city scale should be able to at least challenge the Zapdos. And this still doesn't take into account pokemon like Metagross and Magnezone and Bronzong and Magearna and Celesteel maaaybe Forettress and all the ghost types and Flygon who can at least try to ground the thing or to get status on it. Tanky fliers are a thing, having a lightning advantage in the air is big but it's not insurmountable. And that's without thinking about Aerodactyl and Arceops and Hyrdeigon or pokemon who can learn smackdown or literally anything that just clip the things wing. But yeah, this still assume that the bird never comes down, which is not an assumption I think we should make until we know its canon.

********* You're thinking of all this in game terms though which you shouldn't. I'm assuming due to the destruction they cause then the Stormbringers are heavier than their pokedex counterparts. Assuming that piece of speculation, why would a Smackdown move even work on something so big and heavy? Also a pokemon such as Zapdos who's on top of the food chain would probably just shrug off any but the most powerful status effects. Although we have seen that even Pokeball training barely resists Pressure's effects - what if the reason they were never killed previously was because normally trained Pokemon couldn't resist Pressure at all, and it's only now due to the advancements in technology that it is possible but just hasn't been tried with full force yet. All Stormbringer fights in this fic seem to be defensive and containment efforts, not a full scale mobilization against them which might be enough to bring one down.

*** Now that I think about it, pseudo-legendaries have been conspicuously absent from this story so far. Apparently a single Tyranitar going rogue is enough to classify it as a Tier 2 high-risk scenario. I think you're right, and the power ceiling is ridiculously higher compared to that of the games- a Dragonite, Metagross or Tyranitar must be immensely more powerful than your average Raticate, and there must be a similar gap if not bigger between them and the legendaries. Which makes Mewtwo, who in the game has the highest base stats of all, potentially even more terrifying. It truly resembles a caged Super-AI potential dangerous situation, which makes Giovanni's caution seem really reasonable.

All you need is one person not on board, and you need people to be on board for a long time. Especially since we've seen indication that multiple powerful people, including Oak and Giovanni, strongly dislike these birds. If they actually are capable of killing these things, it would be verrry hard to convince Professor Oak that they aren't. He knows their capabilities.

What I'm saying is, being able to one man a gym leader's entire team is insane. Being able to one-man the teams of an /entire city/ is actually god like. Even without pokemon, humans kill whales like its nothing. I don't know if guns exist in this world (in which case the birds would have to be bullet proof), but is it immune to spears? Harpoons? These are basic weapons that every human society has. Getting a helicopter close enough to harpoon the thing might even be possible. Hell, just hitting the thing with a status effect might be enough. There are literal sword pokemon, you can have them suicide at the thing in an attempt to slice a wing. So like yeah, this thing has to be /insane/ if it has avoided/beaten all that shit for years.

They're pretty clearly lifted from Worm's Endbringers. That's the kind of creature I'd expect Zapdos to be. It's not going to follow the rules. Two dozen lightning rods and a layer of psychic shielding might hold back the lightning from destroying every last member of the defense in a single apocalyptic blast. A barrage of type-advantaged artillery attacks might send the Zapdos dodging back into the clouds for a few seconds.

These things aren't Pokemon. They're gods. This has been pretty clearly established in the story, and I'd be surprised if it obeyed even a fraction of the rules that regular Pokemon do.

That's what this hole story is about. That's why red is a physics and Blue is learning to lead people. The utterly final confront will resolve around this. Mewtwo is the key.

** I recently finished a re-read of the whole story and what best way to celebrate than an adrenaline-fueled Endbring- I mean, Stormbringer chapter!

I didn't realize at first it was the pressure making our heroes go nuts, it was a clever way to showcase its overpowering effects. Also makes sense, since they weren't exposed to anything like it before unlike Blue and Aiko. I expect that the next chapter will be from their perspective and they'll react differently.

Tony's totally not suspicious, by the way! I wonder how many people use Stormbringer attacks as an opportunity to loot the affected areas. It's also an extremely dangerous but potentially incredible opportunity to capture rare, high-level pokemon: I'm pretty sure that Ninetales, Rapidash and so on are supposed to be high tier rare mons! It certainly makes for an interesting ethical conundrum: would you blame a skilled trainer for ignoring the relief effort in favor of catching some rare specimen?

Of course, the big absent so far is the Stormgod Zapdos himself- I really hope that we get to see him in action soon, along with the Gym leaders opposing him at full power!

About the re-read of the story as a whole: I've been thinking about the direction this story is likely to take and I'm wondering whether the original game's final confrontation between Red and Blue will actually happen here. Red's growing interest in Pokemon battling certainly seems to hint in that direction. If that were the case, I'd be really impressed! After all, Prof. Oak is also a pokemon champion himself.

The other main plot points introduced so far have been Mewtwo and the Renegade Conspiracy. I'm guessing Leaf will be heavily involved in the latter, while Red's psychic development hints at a possible confrontation with the former- especially if he ends up training with Sabrina, who also seems to have some kind of Team Rocket affiliation. Finally, there are hints that Silph Co. might be working on a Master Ball to contain the legendaries..

Keep up the good work and can't wait for next chapter..this month's wait is gonna be gruesome :P

***** That's a good point - I hadn't thought that capturing Pokemon does in fact help the defense. And at least for Tier 1 threats, it wasn't considered Renegade behaviour - the Mt. Moon attack involved the Leaders talking about some of the trainers using less lethal attacks to try and capture some Pokemon instead of killing them, but didn't treat them as Renegades. Though they didn't outright abandon their posts, they were just less effective due to their desire to kill two Pidgeys with one Stone Edge, so to speak.

** The Pressure and the stampedes really does an amazing job of making the situation feel utterly hopeless for our heroes. Not in a sense of "We're all going to die", but in a sense of "What are we even doing here? There's literally nothing we can do." Everything has gone wrong almost immediately, and we haven't even SEEN the Stormbringer. It's the same as the first attack, where the enormity of the situation really struck home. Blue had charged towards the fight, and in the end they never even came close. Just the eddies of the Stormbringer's presence almost killed them, and it didn't even notice their existence.

Now, here we are, 50 chapters later...and everything they've done seems meaningless. They're able to protect a few people now, but they're still just struggling to survive the mere harbinger, the aftereffects of the travel of an angry, malevolent god. I suppose that's how the Pressure would feel to me. An overwhelming sense of hopelessness and despair, of the problem's impossible scope, of feeling like all the progress I've made, and all the power I have, is like trying to put out a bushfire by spitting on the flames.

I wonder if Blue will be faring any better.

** I probably missed this when teleportation was first explained, but can't pokemon be trained to teleport humans other than their trainer? It seems to be a consistent restriction, but I don't really understand why.

Assuming each pokemon can only teleport one person, you can still use a pair of pokemon to teleport between A and B multiple times, carrying items.

With that, you can have a team of teleporters repeatedly going from A to B, transporting a person before being returned to Vermillion in their pokeball.

--------------

The problem with an evacuation chain like that is that the teleporters would probably soon be exhausted. But I wonder how many times they could make the trip before needing to rest. You'd probably need a lot of Abras to evacuate a city.

The rangers should totally start a big breeding program, now that they've got a small starting stock.

** Fantastic. I read this fic a while back and the last chapter it was up to was when Red discovered that Bill had the corpse preserving pokeball in his house. A chapter that I personally disliked since I dont like obsessions with immortality, and it made me not check back. I thought for sure Red would end up on that path, constantly thinking about death, and I could not immediately click the next chapter button to find out.

Iv been catching up the last few days because I found myself craving a good pokemon story and decided to return. What a chilling chapter to end it on.

What a force of nature. I felt genuine awe at Zapdos's power and presence. The true perfect storm.

The necessity of Mewtwos existence and the paranoia surrounding his confinement makes sense to me now if hes designed to be powerful enough to defeat the stormbringers. He is also almost sure to be able to destroy regions himself.

Speaking of mewtwo, his chapters have been some of my favorites.

And thank you for not letting leaf be a terrible strawman. My personal values align far more with hers than with Reds so I dont like inhabiting his mind for too long without someone pointing out the flaws and showing that you the author arent just grandstanding a set of ideas.

How would the abilities Trace/Unaware go against Pressure? I'm assuming that Trace wouldn't be able to mimic such a strong pressure and bad cases of Unaware might not survive too long in the wild. Inner focus might work as well, and Abra does have that as an ability.. now assuming we could somehow learn the way Zapdos is flying, would a bunch of Abra armed with a stockpile of sleep spores be enough to knock Zapdos out?
