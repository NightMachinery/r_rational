** Hey everyone, welcome back to a special early chapter! I published today because I'm heading to Scotland tomorrow to teach at ESPR. This means edits to this chapter may be a bit delayed, and after ESPR I'm heading to SPARC in Berkeley, so I've got a busy month coming. I've already written a lot of the next chapter, so hopefully I'll be able to keep the monthly streak going. If, however, no new chapter is up August 1st, I'll try to have it up as soon afterward as I can.

As usual, all feedback is welcome, and to any readers who may be at either camp, feel free to come say hi!

*** Another issue is that only some of real world research (in particular in medicine/microbiology and psychology/sociology) works this way.

- Take a biologist looking for new species in the rain-forest. He doesn't go there to test some hypothesis, he goes there to find previously unknown things.
- Or consider a physics experiment like the LHC. In this case people actually came up with the device to test a hypothesis (that the Higgs boson exists). But the LHC can do much more than that. It generates all kinds of data that is used to answer all kinds of questions, and also to replicate all kinds of previously results.
- Take a chemist trying to find ways to manufacture graphene. They have lots of hypotheses like "this slight tweak to the process will improve yield" or "this route might work". But ideas are cheap, and there actually are lots of theories to generate them. The actual work is in doing the experiments. Prediction markets might help to determine what goals to focus on. But to be able to bet on detailed hypotheses requires expert knowledge that only very few people have, the same people who are qualified to do the research. This knowledge about nitty-gritty will never be written down, because a lot of it is intuitive, instead it is something that phd students learn as part of their education. Additionally, it is very easy to quantify results, you either made graphene or you didn't. So p-hacking should not be a big problem.
- What about exploratory research? Say a new disease pops up, and you want funding to go collect some samples and look at them through a microscope (or for someone else to do this). What hypothesis should be put forth here?
- And I'll not discuss mathematics, which is not really an empirical science anyway.

** This might be my favorite chapter yet! So much nuance, moral ambiguity, mystery, and relatable emotional discomfort from Red's perspective. I really found myself sympathizing with him throughout this chapter, while earlier in the story there were times where I perceived him as being more of a rationalist ideals mouthpiece than a real individual. I honestly would never have expected that a cruise ship arc of all things would turn out to be so full of feelings and foreboding tension despite nothing of note really happening yet. While I feel a bit guilty for it, I hope that Red's romantic anguish will keep on tormenting him for a bit longer without any kind of convenient resolution- I believe in character growth through hardship, after all! Also welcome aboard Pikachu, I wonder how long it'll take until he evolves into Raichu! Oh, wait a sec...

** Figured there'd be something along these lines popping up. If things can be constructed via pokeball/container, no reason why a living being can't be.

I do wonder how psychic interference/stimuli will work out in the case of cloned pokemon. IIRC the only abilities that have been shown so far are all sensory and communication based, so if there's some kind of body snatching/controlling ability some psychics can use then it might be possible to shape a clone's brain to basically build a mind. It would probably be way less effective than a natural born pokemon, but it's something interesting to think about at least.

** Okay so first off, it seems to me that Raikoth is more of your suggestion for the real world rather than something actually having to do with the plot. Nonetheless, I do think it opens up an interesting discussion on the topic.

First off, I think the proposal of having other people perform your suggested experiments is a bit flawed. A lot of research takes multiple attempts and multiple hypotheses to be successful. For example, if your goal is to create a chemical that turns Charmanders blue, you would need to test multiple mixtures and dosages of various different chemicals. So it really doesn't work for things like the millenium problems, IE the 7 math problems that some school said "We'll give a million dollars to the first person who solves one of these problems". It might work for sociological studies. However, a simpler solution would be to have experiments be routinely reproduced (which is ideally what should be happening right now).

Personally, my biggest problem with academia is not the quality of their information, but their willingness to actually spread that information. We are literally in the Information Age. There has never been more of a desire for people to know what the fuck they're talking about. The problem is that the people with the most quality information, the people who actually do research in their fields and know what's going on, are not willing to spread that information. You can't get mad that people are following shoddy information about climate change when they are doing nothing to make their own information available to the every day person. We don't have biology professors manning Tumblr blogs that keep us up to date with are frequent breakthroughs in genetic research. We don't have philosophy professors writing reddit posts explaining in layman terms the ins and outs of Nietzchian philosophy. We don't have a climate change database outlining the various studies and inventions in that field in a way that the normal person can follow along. The two examples we do have of academics putting their input on a subject, Askhistorians and Askscience, are absolutely fantastic. But those two subs don't cover everything, they only cover what there's an interest in (which is also a problem with your betting suggestion), they don't provide a strong database (although askhistorians tries to), and they don't really keep up with updates (if there's a breakthrough in a certain scientific field, it's doubtful it would be covered on askscience).

And it's not like people are unwilling to learn. Whenever a professor shows up on the internet, they get quite a following. I highly doubt [[https://www.facebook.com/thekarenbrown/posts/10215764784460167][this facebook post]] on immigration would get half the attention it did if the author didn't mention that she was a professor in the opening paragraph. Piero Scaruffi, who's actual profession is performing lectures at Stanford and Harvard on cognitive science and artificial intelligence, is very well known among music fans for his exceptionally controversial opinions. And probably even more notable is Jordan Peterson. His fame has the same roots as Tomi Laren and Milo Yiannopolus, ya know the people who acted like bashing political correctness was some revolutionary concept, but his fame has proven to be much more sustainable. The people are starving to hear some actual intelligence in the cluster fuck of stupid that is the internet. It's time people with the actual power to do so actually go ahead and do it.

*** Definitely agree that information should be more widespread and accessible. The pokemon world already sort of has that cultural achievement, at least when it comes to pokemon, with the availability of pokedex. But even then there are some secrets, and there will always be incentives to keep information hidden, either for personal benefit or just as part of the system that funds its creation or vetting.

** Cloning? Leaf would totally shove red into a machine and get a more romantic version of him.

Also: Leaf oughta do something 'bout protein. At that rate Red's gonna end up with Sabrina.

Pikachu evolving? Can't wait 'til Red says "Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!".

  Once they and their pokemon are tired out, they decide to try some of the assorted drinks from the room's bar. Leaf opens one of the miniature liquor bottles, some kind of plum flavored rice wine that they both take turns sipping and making faces at as they try to acclimate to the taste. Red's lips tingle each time they touch the bottle mouth, and he's not sure if it's from the alcohol or from his knowledge of what was just touching it. Soon his cheeks feel flushed, which he's pretty sure is <em>not</em> from the alcohol. Or not exclusively, anyway.

Trying hard for that lemon tag arentch'a.

Unrelated news: nobody noticed that the Alolan forms fanart of the gen 1 kids had Leaf drinking /lemon/ juice. [[https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/2528236]] (NSFW)

Trivia time: what would happen if Articuno and Moltres decide to roost at the same place? Would Moltres set fire to an ice chicken? Moltres turns into blue fire? Zapdos decides to intervene because of a type advantage?

*** Nah, was never a fan of the Team Rocket Trio, and they didn't show up in the games except Yellow, which follows the anime, so I'm ignoring them unless I can think of some reason to include them.

**** I feel like the anime version of Team Rocket, re-imagined as scientists trying to impress Giovanni, rather than grunts with the same role, would be only characters I can see being foolish enough to use stolen cloning tech and try and solve the "absent mind problem" in some genius but shortsighted way that ultimately ends up creating a Pokemon with a human like brain.

Why go through the trouble of laboriously growing a human-pokemon hybrid, when you can use this reconstruction technology to essentially "insert" a human-like brain into a Pokemon body (ignoring how complex actually doing this would be, of course)? Only this time, instead of a potential psychic god, James and Jessie end of creating a snarky Meowth that is essentially a weak, pacifistic, walking existential crisis.

** I've come soliciting help from people who have finished the chapter:

I've stopped reading at the problem about =the story of how General Hideyoshi fooled the Mori clan's undefeated psychic warlord at Himeji Castle into falsely believing that he was surrendering?=. I don't want to read on and =admit to ignorance without at least trying to figure out the answer=. But I must ask before hand - is it even possible for me to work out the answer? And important follow-up question - does it rely on mechanics of the story so far, or if I happened to know a perfect psychic in our real world (no Pokemon world), would it work there too?
