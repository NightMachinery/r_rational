  [A MESSAGE BLARING, DEAFENING EVEN OVER THE SOUNDS OF SCREAMS, OF EXPLOSIONS, OF RUSHING WIND. A MESSAGE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THE WORDS THEMSELVES SOUNDING TWISTED AND ALIEN---*YOU WILL ATONE FOR ATROCITY. YOU WILL ATONE FOR ATROCITY. YOU WILL ATONE FOR ATROCITY.*]
#+end_quote

And we start off strong with our Ellimist Chronicles cameo. I think by now we've covered them all except /Visser/, kind of (and I don't think the Los Angeles characters from /Visser/ would fit here, given Visser One never went to Earth).

It seems Toomin's implied backstory remains mostly the same: aliens destroyed his civilization because of their simulated games. It's pretty short and open-ended, which is probably for the best, given how little sense the original backstory made. It's also got a kinda religious-like feeling, like "inquisitors telling you to repent for your sins while butchering your people and wiping out your town".

#+begin_quote
  ‹Why do you hold yourself apart?› we asked, trying not to gasp. ‹Why do you not embrace?›
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he's just /standing there/.

#+begin_quote
  ‹We need to talk first,› said Temrash.
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he says he wants to talk.

#+begin_quote
  There was a feeling of closeness, a slight pressure in the emptiness around us, as if Perdão had leaned in to whisper.
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he starts edging you.

#+begin_quote
  Perdão paused, and it seemed that we could feel its sadness, feel a flicker of connection despite the mental distance it was imposing. ‹And yet, nothing on our world flies, and so we never thought to take to the skies. In one sense, we never even realized that there was a sky, until Seerow came down out of it.›

  ‹What does this have to do with the war?› we asked, unable to keep the impatience from creeping into our voice. It was one thing to stand alone in the silence of the eib, but this--- Perdão was so close. The promise of embrace---of relief---was distracting, intoxicating, maddening. It took all of our willpower to remain even somewhat focused on the conversation, the more so given that we had no roadmap, no sense of where it was going.
#+end_quote

TFW you want to merge with your boyfriend and he starts giving you a history lesson.

#+begin_quote
  ‹You are less entwined than you think, child-that-has-named-itself-Helium. Elfangor does not fidget and whine. Has he become lost within Aximili?›

  The words were like a sudden splash of cold water, cutting through the fog of distraction, snapping our attention inward.
#+end_quote

TFW you ask to merge with your boyfriend and he calls you whiny.

#+begin_quote
  Perdão exploded, a wave of sheer emotional power that filled the eib and left us reeling. ‹YES!› it screamed. ‹A response! Jesus everloving FUCK, how can you know about this---how can a whole SPECIES know of something like this and simply---go on?›
#+end_quote

TFW you're waiting to merge with your boyfriend and she shouts that you're not taking his lesson seriously.

#+begin_quote
  ‹Morph,› Perdão whispered. We could feel their presence in the eib, as if they were standing beside us, looking over our shoulder. ‹Those of you who were in morph---demorphed, somehow, there was no body but you demorphed anyway. And those of you who were not in morph were simply brought.›
#+end_quote

TFW you start thinking about your boyfriend's history lesson, and he gets closer to better see your thoughts.

#+begin_quote
  There was a grim silence, and then suddenly Perdão was with us, began to expand and enfold and fuse with us, the empty eib coming alive with light and sound. Doorways opened, and thoughts unfurled, and we looked---
#+end_quote

TFW you've been so distracted you almost forgot about your boyfriend, and /now/ he merges with you.

#+begin_quote
  ‹More than three times what it took the humans. And their gravity is stronger than yours, their moon more distant.›
#+end_quote

Nice canon nod there.

#+begin_quote
  ‹But your species was at peace with itself. The eib had unified you. And against outside enemies---your communications were already secure, since thought-speak cannot be intercepted. And you could solve complex mathematical equations in your head. Your people never felt the need for mechanical computers---never started down the path that ends with machines far more powerful than you.›
#+end_quote

Oh, that reminds me, this raises an interesting question: why were the Andalites so militarized?

If they were at peace for an eternally long time, what did they need a military for? Why did they need a military genius like Alloran to create their entire doctrine, and way of thinking, from scratch? Colonialism? What did they need the colonies for? Did they fight an external invader? If so, why did the yeerks not make contact with that invader?

#+begin_quote
  ‹This is not natural, child-that-has-named-itself-Helium. Something has made your people like this.›
#+end_quote

Eh, I'm not sure I buy the argument here. There are plausible reasons a social, telepathic species would evolve super strong social conforming mechanisms that would keep them from questioning why we're all obeying the king's orders.

#+begin_quote
  ((It was shameful---chilling---almost incomprehensibly distressing. We had known---Essak had told Aximili of the rift, and still we had not made the connection at the critical moment, that Chancellor Lirem's threat was empty, that the rift would protect Earth from Z-space bombardment. We had not yet even begun to process the magnitude of that error---were not sure which was worse, the prospect of mental interference or the possibility that we had committed such an oversight entirely on our own---))
#+end_quote

Oh, yeah, what the hell, Ax-and-Essak? You kind of screwed that one up.

#+begin_quote
  Visser Three had been fomenting discord and chaos within the larger Yeerk command structure---Terra was not clear on all of the details, but Visser One had been deposed and had vanished from custody prior to a court martial
#+end_quote

Yup, that sounds like Visser One.

#+begin_quote
  We had thought that this might be the more difficult argument to win---that the humans would be skeptical of the possibility, and slow to acknowledge the risk. But Marco had seen the logic of it immediately
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, I see nothing suspicious in the fact that Marco seems perfectly amenable to the plausibility of a plan involving the creation of a large number of Horcruxes.

#+begin_quote
  then obviously one of the very first things you would do would be to arrange for copies of yourself to be sent to safe and faraway locations. Dormant copies, perhaps---triggered by a dead man's switch---or active copies, if you were already confident in your ability to coordinate and cooperate with yourself.
#+end_quote

Yup. Someone read /Methods of Rationality/, read Quirrel's plan and thought "I can do better".

#+begin_quote
  Which led to conclusion two: the Visser could no longer be stopped by conventional means.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't go that far. If it bleeds, you can kill it.

If your Horcruxes cost money to build, and you don't have infinite money, and you've pissed off every major military force out there, then you're still kinda screwed.

#+begin_quote
  Our mouth was dry again. “The most likely outcome is the eradication of all members of the target species. The target genus, in some cases. Conceivably, the entire genetic molecule, and any organism from the same evolutionary lineage.”
#+end_quote

I really like this adaptation of the quantum virus. It makes perfect sense, it's horrifying, it would probably be an incredibly painful way for an entire civilization to die.

I'm imagining the virus takes time to mutate from one particle for the next. So people would see other people disintegrate, or maybe suffer from something close to radiation poisoning as some of their DNA disintegrates, and know that something is targeting the entire species, and all they could do is watch as their civilization slowly crumbles apart until, eventually, all humans have died one way or another. It would be like the Thanos snap, except spread over weeks, months, or even /decades/.

I like it.

  Marco scoffed, pushed his hands into his pockets, kicked idly at the floor. “But who knows,” he said. “'Course, if it turns out they're not on our side, we're already fucked, so fuck it. Pretty much standard operating procedure at this point, right?”
#+end_quote

You know, it's interesting how /daunting/ everything is in this fic, compared to the original.

In the original, it's like "Yaay! We got robot friends to help us with the invasion!". And the heroes can always solve every problem by throwing 5 zoo animals of some sort at it, now matter how big it is.

Here it's like "Okay, so we've got this plan where we're 90% likely to all die and the survivors will see our species be genocided, but every other option is the same except the genocide will 100% happen, so let's do it".

#+begin_quote
  We glared, and he shrugged. “I'm not going to not say it,” he declared. “And I'm not going to not think it, either. We don't know what the hell kind of mind games a Yeerk can pull off with---what is it, now---two or three years of total, uninterrupted access. [...] Pretty sure if I could push someone's orgasm button whenever I felt like for three years, I could clicker train them into whatever shape I wanted.”
#+end_quote

Yes, Marco, this is the perfect thing to say right now.

Tobias and Helium are perfectly comfortable with you mentioning a yeerk pressing someone's orgasm button.

(this does underline that Ax never really addressed the fact that Temrash manipulated him, and the implications of it; namely, that Helium isn't nearly as safe from as he'd like to be from hostile influence)

#+begin_quote
  So who's to say he didn't get himself cloned into some completely different biology, or upload himself into a robot, or something---something a quantum virus wouldn't be able to hit?”
#+end_quote

I mean, lots of people would like to upload themselves into robots, and yet we're still free from Cyborg Musk.

Just because bunkers exist as a concept doesn't mean nukes are useless.

#+begin_quote
  “---or no, wait, I've got it, it's the first in a series of clues that lead to a time machine, and we've got to solve them before Visser Three gets there first and assimilates the Earth back in cowboy times---”
#+end_quote

Look, Marco, everybody knows the Megamorphs book were dumb, but you don't have to be /mean/ about it.

#+begin_quote
  we could throw that fucking keychain into the ocean and the next thing you know we'd just happen to stumble across a bunch of stranded Andalite warriors who crash-landed last year and have been just waiting for their chance.
#+end_quote

Well... it /would/ be a valuable occasion to teach them the errors of their handicap-intolerant culture, and also experience the complete trippyness of morphing into bees.

#+begin_quote
  But what happens when it turns out that was misdirection too, and everything we've been doing was exactly what the real bad guys wanted us to do?
#+end_quote

No, I don't think The One is canon in this fic.

#+begin_quote
  Like, if things really are so close that all it takes to shift the balance is a bunch of idiot teenagers with a death wish, then what's stopping us from being the reason everything goes to shit?

#+begin_quote
  The creature shrugged again. “It sounded like you had questions,” it said.

  “Are you offering answers?”

  “Some. Never hurts to ask, right?”
#+end_quote

It's funny, we've got a lot of "ROB sits down and explains the plot to the protagonist" moments in fics posted here, lately. The Dungeon Master in WtC, the Wandering Bard in PGtE, the smiley guy in With This Ring, Death of the Endless in that one Luthor comic, and now this.

This chapter in particular feels especially close to the first chat with the Dungeon Master in WtC, with pretty similar beats.

#+begin_quote
  “You're thinking that the Visser is too far ahead. That he has too many advantages, too many resources, too much control. But the same was true of the Visigoths, in the year 410.”
#+end_quote

Yeah, I can totally see Visser Three becoming a semi-permanent problem that nation-planets have to deal with for generations. Like, every so often you hear news about Esplin-controlled terrorists capturing some military base and stealing all its weapons and infrastructure, and maybe blowing up a city or two as part of a larger plan.

#+begin_quote
  “If you were seeking to destroy all life on Earth, you might first create an industrial society of intelligent beings capable of doing the job thoroughly, rather than risking a quicker, more haphazard solution,”
#+end_quote

[Insert Donald Trump joke here].

#+begin_quote
  “We will go,” we said. “Us-singular. Helium.”
#+end_quote

Helium, it just said that the constraints of the game are the decisions you make.

That means you want to make /informed/ decisions, where you spend some time wondering about the consequences of your choice, weighing alternatives against each other, and probably talking it out with your friends. Which is the /opposite/ of what you're going, taking an easily-manipulated decision on impulse with no questions asked.

#+begin_quote
  “Is there a time limit on this conversation?” Marco asked abruptly. “Or, like, a limited number of questions? Are we going to get halfway through some important topic and then you're going to be all, ‘whoops, time's up, guess we have to leave it there'?”

  “There's no limit,” the creature said. “But I get to decide when I'm done, same as you.”

  “Time's up,” said the creature.
#+end_quote

Well someone's having fun.

And is a liar.

#+begin_quote
  “Helium,” said Prince Jake. “His n---don't call him ‘Ax' anymore. Ax---Ax died in the line of duty. This is his---heir. Call him Helium.”
#+end_quote

There are some interesting parallels to transgender issues being drawn here.

#+begin_quote
  Yet another silence--- (This one just about the right length, we noted, for Marco to consider making a joke, and then decide against it.)
#+end_quote

"Whatever floats you boat."

#+begin_quote
  We turned to look at Prince Jake, saw that his lips were drawn tight, his own knuckles white and bloodless.
#+end_quote

I feel sorry for Jake. From his perspective, he's just woken up, it's been a few days since the Ventura pool mission, and people keep giving him shit for reasons beyond his control.

I sure hope that doesn't lead to any negative consequences in future chapters.

** Just binge read the whole thing. Great work. I especially like the reimagining of the Yeerks.

When it was revealed that pools are immortal super organisms, one of my thoughts was, "but what happens if a pool gets cancer?", I figured that the pool could consciously react, ejecting the mass. Unlike humans, a Yeerk Pool can cut off huge chunks of themselves without injury. But then what if that tumor can survive on its own? It's likely that there are entire ecosystems on their homeworld of protist-like nonsapient creatures descended from the sapient Yeerks.

And then when we find out that Esplin is trying to clone itself and subvert existing pools, I realized "Oh, that's what happens when a Yeerk Pool gets cancer. The cancer decides to conquer the galaxy."

A quote [[https://www.bogleech.com/haranomushi/26-keishaku.html][from Jonathan Wojcik]]:

#+begin_quote
  Humans exhibit no known example of a contagious cancer, but canids such as wolves, coyotes and domestic dogs suffer from a sexually transmitted cancer line still displaying its own distinct DNA - the DNA of the first dog to ever develop it. A dog that has been dead for thousands of years. This cancer line is literally a separate living organism genetically distinct from every one of its hosts and has continued to adapt for millenia into new strains, yet we do not officially consider it a species of parasite in its own right for the simple reason that it is still genetically the tissue of a dog. Admittedly, this would be because any instance that grew too distinct from a dog would be more easily identified and wiped out by the immune system of any new host, so its origin as dog tissue essentially "imprisons" it within its Canis taxonomy

**** A contagious tumor /isn't/ typically considered to be its own organism, but they can have a karyotype different from that of their host, and are subject to distinct evolutionary pressures, so it's a difference of magnitude rather than a difference of kind.

Consider the following:

- There are concerns that devil facial tumors may jump to related species like quolls. Canine transmissible tumors probably originated in a wolf or dog, and have /already/ spread to foxes and coyotes. And there are transmissible bivalve tumors which can spread between wildly different species.

- The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placozoa][placozoa]] are the simplest of all animals, little more than a scrap of epithelium. One hypothesis for their evolution is that they descended from a more complicated organisms with muscles and neurons.

** I was literally cheering at my iPad screen by the end of this chapter. Ho. lee. S**t. I thought the return of the Ellimist would be the chapter's high point, but then: OFF-WORLD MISSION. I am so stoked for this. I didn't think this fic would go there, but now we're going to get some classic, bloody, morph-vs-alien Animorphs.

Also, that weird invisible alien device is definitely the remote startup key to an ancient underwater Pemalite ship that holds the secret to unlocking the Chee's block on violence, just saying. >95% confident. Ever since the Chee showed up in this fic, I've been waiting for that shoe to drop, as it's the only means I can think of that yields any sort of fighting chance against Visser Three. I predict that by the end of the fic, the Animorphs will end up with the Pemalite ship as their own personal spaceship. I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but if canon is at all being followed then this seems the likely course of events.

I was going to do a quote-review like Couteau Bleu, but there's just too much here. It's all outstanding. I loved Ax's internal dialogues. I loved the conversation with the Ellimist. I loved the army of Marcos. I wrote down several good quotes from this chapter in my personal notebook. Wasn't sure if I could get into this fic again after so long, but yet again it exceeds expectations.

**** Alright, /sigh/, I'll do /some/ blow-by-blows.

So the first thing that occurred to me when reading this chapter was that every time we've ever seen someone wake up from being a morph-made-permanent, they have visions related to Crayak and Ellimist. This hasn't affected the plot so far, so I've been attributing it to a convenient writing device to provide backstory. But it occurs to me that morphs are constructed from data stored in some cosmic cloud machine, so maybe it's plausible that every time a morph is constructed, a bit of the Ellimist or Crayak's memories get unintentionally mixed in for some reason.

  Basically, any configuration of matter---any set of atoms, molecules, cells, whatever---has an inverse, a complement, a dual.  There exists a /Z-particle/ for any given particle, a Z-object for any given object, such that the Z-object will generate an attractive force that draws its real-space complement /into/ Z-space.

I love the physics worldbuilding here. This opens up so many possibilities. I wonder if the quantum virus could be made to pay attention to a multiply-realizable pattern instantiated on different substrates. Seems unlikely given this description. But Visser Three might be vulnerable to a more basic molecular attack if he's been using any unique identifying molecule in his experiments (I don't get the sense he's progressed to the point of having robot brains or brains with very different biologies yet).

#+begin_quote
  “It turns out that the Z-particles don't /just/ straightforwardly break down.  In some cases, there can be mutation first.  If one of them happens to deform such that it matches some other similar particle in real space, the whole reaction starts all over again.  And the smaller the particle, the higher the risk of mutation.”
#+end_quote

Okay, so wait. If it's easier to make Z-particles that correspond to, say, proteins than to people, then surely it's even easier to make ones that correspond to protons. Which would immediately annihilate all matter in the universe, even if one just accidentally fluctuated into existence somewhere. So why does anything exist at all?

Okay, so the Middle East, cradle of early civilization, probably has a Pemalite ship in it. Suggesting that the Chee were around a lot of ancient and far-reaching civilizations. We learned a while back that there is something special going on with Rachel and the Chee, and that Rachel "was not supposed to be here." So, wild speculation here, the ancient Chee somehow got a list from the Gods of which people would exist in the future, which is for... I don't know what... but Rachel is not on the list so she is an exception. Or, more plausibly, maybe it's some genetic marker, and lots of people don't have the marker, but the Animorphs were all supposed to, except Rachel was unintended and she happened not to have the genetic marker... I really don't know what to make of the Rachel thing so far, but that's the best I've got. I don't know why the ancient Gods would explicitly program a list of probably future people into the Chee. Actually, maybe Rachel /does/ have the genetic marker where most people don't, and it is part Pemalite DNA or something, so the Chee listen to Rachel (and anyone else who has the marker). Hmmm. ??

So I wonder which being we are talking to now, Crayak (Order) or the Ellimist (Chaos)? Assuming that the avatar truly can't lie, we've got confirmation that this avatar, at least, is the one that messed with Marco. I was going to say that this being is the one that killed Cassie as well, but technically when it says "I created the preconditions for her decision... I arranged those preconditions so that, of her possible choices, the ones that I preferred would seem better to her as well," it doesn't actually confirm that Cassie chose as intended. But it seems likely that this is the same being.

A curious thing.

So, my intended interpretation is that the avatar is in fact an independent, self-aware, sapient consciousness, that can have its utility function edited essentially "at will" by either Crayak or the Ellimist, as long as they're acting in accordance with the game rules. They set it up to perform a task, that task is vetted by the arbiter, and then it just goes off and works, but it's truly an /agent./ It might receive telepathic communication from C or E, or it might get re-edited in the moment if things go off the rails, but it isn't straightforwardly a player avatar; neither C nor E is "present" in the room.

That being said, it /does/ sometimes speak as if it literally /is/ C or E, such as it taking credit for "creating the preconditions."

I-as-author have a clear sense of which agenda is being primarily pursued in any given appearance of the avatar, C's or E's, but a) note that they often both have the /same/ agenda, since they're doing the anti-Red-Queen thing (or, like, often I want you to take my bishop with your pawn, and you also want to take my bishop with your pawn, and who knows which one of us is correct about my-bishop-being-taken being better for us), and b) I think it might be more fun to leave confirmation out of the text, and let readers decide whether they believe e.g. Marco's conclusions about any given instance.

#+end_quote

The problem with just saying that no one has made H2 particles on purpose is that if these particles can be artificially made at all, it seems likely that some lab somewhere might /accidentally/ made H2 particles as a byproduct when trying to make protein-specific particles.

Here's what I might do with the physics. Per duality, the smaller the real-matter particle, the larger and more unstable the Z-space dual particle, and also the stronger the attractive force. Thus to make the dual for H2 requires exponentially more energy than making one for a whole protein, and this dual particle decays faster, so even if accidentally produced it can't always get to its real-space counterpart before it decays. On the other hand, the dual particles for complex objects are small, plentiful, and easy to make, practically just a quantum soup of vacuum fluctuation, but correspondingly the attractive force is exponentially weaker, and since the form of large objects constantly fluctuates, there's basically no risk of annihilation for complex objects (also, it's very hard to intentionally produce the exact flavor of Z-particle for any given complex object due not to energy issues but to precision issues). Which leaves a happy medium of protein-sized particles, which are large enough so that creating the dual particle requires a manageable (but still large) energy (they need a very large particle accelerator facility to get off the ground, not easy for just anyone to build), and which are small enough that their Z-particle dual can be pinned down precisely, and will have the right level of attractive force to propagate.

I'm not sure if that fits with what you've set up in the text, but yeah, that's what I'd probably do.

******** It occurs to me that this also can explain lots of other phenomena, like psychic abilities. Suppose that when a structure is large enough, the corresponding Z-dual doesn't pull strongly enough to annihilate the object, but can still influence the object. Suppose that Z-duals for things on the order of neural circuits are low energy enough that they can be produced by biological processes. So a creature evolves the ability to make Z-duals for parts of its brain, and then the brain evolves to leverage dual particles, etc. There is the issue of Z-dual precision. Let's say that bio-processes can't produce exact Z-particle matches to any given structure (that requires too much information), but approximate duals are enough to have a very, very small influence, not usually enough for TK powers, but sufficient to tip a neuron's firing threshold when enough approximate Z-duals are present. Since these particles are in Z space, distance isn't a problem, and other members of your species can be instantly influenced too, leading to psychic communication.

So there are still problems with this model. Thought-speak has limited range, whereas the quantum virus has unlimited range. I suppose the weaker attractive force for larger structures is the limiter? (The Z particles decay before they can accelerate across the galaxy). There is also the question of directed thought-speak. That implies control over the where the Z-particles go, which implies other kinds of interactions going on between Z particles. Which is fine, but that implies that a quantum virus could be shielded against in principle by the same forces which allow directed beams of Z-duals. Which may or may not be an okay implication for the story you want to tell. Or perhaps individual brains are uniquely identified by certain structures, and to communicate, you just make Z-particles tailored to each individual.

There is also the question of how interspecies thought-speak works (and how individuals are identified telepathically in the first place). I guess a telepath's brain can use the Z-duals for smaller, more common neural structures to probe another being's brain structure, and then build Z-duals more precisely tailored to those circuits. Leeran hypersight, for example, is very advanced in this regard, producing so many probing Z-duals that there are whole-brain effects on nearby creatures similar to strong psychedelic drugs.

*** The Andalites aren't a pacifist race. They believe they are because their government is very fond of revisionist history, and their extreme networking allows them to alter records (and, to some extent, memories) at will.

In reality, they have a long history of wars, both internal and external. Alloran rose to celebrity by saving the andalite race from a war they started with an enemy that almost wiped them out; the importance of that war was then downplayed in andalite culture, and the only traces of it that remain are the intense professionalization of their military-industrial complex.

(this isn't that implausible; eg, France has very little awareness of its military-industrial complex, and of the intensity and brutality of its past colonial wars)

Besides, we know from canon that Andalites invented computers before books, or at least that Ax found the concept of a book a technological marvel.

*** One answer that comes to mind is that the Andalite military wasn't really a military, more of a coast guard and gendarmerie crossed with NASA, designed to deal with (at most) martial (if technologically inferior) alien species. If you're building spacecraft for exploratory purposes and even if you were the most technologically advanced space-faring civilisation in your area of space, arming them with some simple weapons would not be a bad idea. There seem to have been massive space battles starting very early in the war, but nothing says these weren't the Andalite equivalent of modern US Coast Guard cutters battling it out with the Yeerk equivalent of pre-dreadnought battleships. Heck, this could be the reason that the Andalites have lost so much ground - by the time they retooled their civilisation to produce high tech war machines and got their war doctrines up to scratch, the Yeerks have caught up.

Alternatively, since it's explicitly stated in this chapter that all the intelligent species discovered so far seem to have been "designed" to interact in certain ways, maybe the Ellimist/Crayak deliberately engineered a predatory species that the Andalites would encounter early in their spacefaring age, and would have to defeat - leaving a legacy of militarisation and war-organisation on the Andalite culture which would have ramifications for the future Andalite-Yeerk war.

** Ok one night of sleep later here's my thoughts on the chapter:

- I think E/C are capable of lying, or a lie uses a move as per the rules of the game.

- How convenient to be discussing a quantum virus and then ending up on the homeworld of the alien species who could put together a really good one?

- Speaking of the Arn, since V3 isn't demanding tribute any longer it sounds like the Kandrona-virus was a success and V3 decided to give himself an upgrade.

- Perdao seems to be a bit bigger than Temrash. I have a funny mental image of someone outgrowing their prosthetic limb and needing a bigger one.

- There is something interesting about the Ellimist dreams. The Ketrans, like the Andalites, use base 7 for their counting, which supports Perdao's hypotheses on the Andalites' development being influenced by E/C.

- Time didn't stop when the avatar came to have a chat with the boys. Jake appeared after a delay on the HB world.

- I think one of the biggest recurring themes in this story is identity, and we're treated to some interesting and differing views on it. We have the Yeerks who embrace a loss of self with the coalesecion, V3 who has a very strict definition of self (and what a contrast it is to the rest of his species!), Andalites who have a coalescion-lite setup with the eib and the Path, and humans who overall feel that each morph clone isn't quite 'self', but close enough to accept morph clone resurrection.

- Alloran's body now produces Kandrona, yeah, which means the Arn have solved the problem for Andalite physiology (including a delivery virus) as well as for human physiology.

** I've been thinking about the quantum virus stuff a bit lately. Specifically this part,

#+begin_quote
  “One time, it stayed stable, and no one knows why. To this day, every time we synthesize more of that particular particle, it gets pulled into Z-space almost immediately.”
#+end_quote

I don't think that particle just magically stayed stable. To me it seems more likely that what happened was that they accidentally made a particle that did correspond to a bit of someone's biology accidentally. The reason the particle still gets pulled into z-space would then be because the aliens' biology is keeping the reservoir full as it were.

If this is the case, then the good news is that they didn't accidentally commit genocide at least. But they did heck with someone's biology. It could be something simple like messing with pigment molecules and making the species albino, or a digestive protein so now there's a universal food intolerance in the species.

But the fact that it was brought up at all makes me think we might see it again. So, what's the scariest possibility I can think of? The andalites might have accidentally given someone a z-space based immune system. This is very speculative on my part of course. It would require that the synthesized particle could pull another particle into z-space with it and then predictably break down into 2 components. One representing the antibody and the other the foreign substance. If it worked, then any disease that infected even one individual would quickly be destroyed everywhere, and if the foreign substance getting cleaned up was one of your skin cells or something, well maybe don't shake their hands ok?

** I confess I don't fully understand the Marco stuff.

So he convinced a bunch of terminally ill people to morph him and stay past the limit, so there's now many comatose Marcos Levy lying around in hospitals. And he figured out how to get those Marcos to acquire morphs from him while comatose.

(I guess there's some potential awkwardness here in that if all their morphs come from him, no two of them can use the same morph at once.)

And he figured out some way of coordinating with himself before doing this, so they all know how to do it. I figure the details of that probably aren't meant to be obvious and aren't super important. (Except that "abnegation" did feel like I should understand what that meant, and I don't.) But at least part of it is arranging who's going to go after Laocoön to stop him running into the forest?

And they all got woken up when they were brought over here? Or... some of them had already woken up, and only those ones came along? It kind of sounds like some of them went on and made more clones, or am I misreading "you're my granddad" and the bit about "unless I got myself captured"?

"Heimdall" is... a name that Marco-who-was-with-Ax has uniquely, and another one has "Aurora" and another has "Laocoön"? I guess those are the names of the people they morphed from? (Edit: wait, but they have no way of knowing that, right?) But it sounds like "Heimdall" carries some amount of authority, is that just because they all expect Heimdall to have the most information?

The numbers they give are a counter that he's been increasing internally so that he knows how much time it's been since each one was created?

Anyway, I thought this was a great chapter even with how confusing it was. I laughed out loud a few times, especially at the early parts of the avatar conversation, and Marco's speech at the end gave me chills.

*** He didn't figure out how to get them to acquire from him; he just transferred the morphing power to them while they were sleeping. When they wake up, they wake up knowing that they're clones (because he planned it all out and then slept on it so they all inherited memories of deciding to do this), and knowing that they have the morphing power, but not having acquired anyone and anything.

So each of them wakes up and is like, "Go time, I guess," and goes out into the world in some different direction, acquiring morphs and weapons and information, attempting to maneuver himself into some useful position in a community or a government or a company or whatever. They're each of them just doing what Marco would do if he were on his own, without the Animorphs as backup and support.

He did some thinking ahead of time about code words and coordination (Heimdall means "I think I know what's going on better than anyone else, so let me talk" in case two or more Marcos meet and don't know who should get the conch; Laocoön is a reference to someone who gave a dire warning and wasn't believed). Most of it just derives from his own internal nerd culture and sense of humor, and it's expandable in the sense that if he comes up with an "obvious" new code word or reference, all of the other Marcos will "get it" immediately, since they share 99.999% of his personality and memories.

The intended interpretation is that, out of thirty-or-so clones, only a dozen had woken up yet, and so the Ellimist/Crayak avatar only sent a dozen on the mission.

None of them were able to make more clones on their own, since there's only one blue box and the core Animorphs still have it. The "you're my grandad" was a joke on how they organize themselves via number. The "main" Marco keeps memorizing the next power-of-two every few days, so Marcos can tell how "old" they are relative to one another based on the largest power-of-two they can remember.

It might be pretty dangerous. If whoever you're morphed into also morphs, they probably can't receive signals and also wouldn't be able to control the morph as their unconscious so both bodies would just die. I don't know if there's any risk in accidental morphing, but it's probably worth avoiding the risk anyway if you can acquire the morphing power afterwards.

***** It's never been explained outright in the text, so it's reasonable for there to be some confusion/uncertainty.

My general model is this:

The Yeerk tissue that's sitting on top of the brain, acting as a control interface, doesn't have anything /sustaining/ it. It doesn't have anywhere to draw nutrients from, doesn't have a way to metabolize or excrete, doesn't have a functioning immune system like a full Yeerk.

That's fine from a design standpoint, because it never needs to live for more than a few hours.

So when you stay past the time limit, and the pocket dimension collapses, and the Yeerk-flesh stops receiving signals, you just fall into a coma. The Yeerk-flesh is like the driver of a car who's fallen unconscious---the car no longer runs because there's nothing steering, nobody pushing the gas, etc.

But over time, that Yeerk-flesh is going to die. It's going to starve, and the human immune system is going to start chopping away at it, eating it up, cleaning it out. Eventually, enough of it is dead and gone that there's just ... nothing stopping the person from being normal-awake again.

The Chee just speed this process along by straight-up lasering away the interfering dead flesh.

Person A acquires DNA from a skunk and morphs into it.

Person B acquires DNA from /Person A in skunk morph/. In doing this, Person B's morph has all the physiology of the original skunk, /plus/ the layer of receptor Yeerk tissue that was introduced when Person A morphed the skunk.

Now Person B morphs the skunk, and they add /their/ layer of receptor tissue on top of all of that. If Person A isn't in morph, there's no problem; the signal is received by the top layer of tissue, routes through the dormant tissue it picked up from Person A's morph, and executes normally in the skunk brain.

The /problem/ arises when Person A is in skunk morph at the /same time/ as someone else further down the acquiring pipeline - in this case, Person B. A's Z-space body send out the signal, and the Yeerk receptor tissue in their morph back on earth picks it up and operates as normal. Problem is, if A and B are /both/ in morph, then the otherwise dormant layer of tissue in B's morph picks up the signal, too. Now that poor skunk body is receiving signals from two Z-space bodies, and it twitches and convulses.

Like, imagine you plug your VCR into your TV's input jacks. Works great, let's watch Homeward Bound. But then you plug your DVD player into the /VCR's/ input jacks. Well, your DVDs and your VHS's will each still work fine, as long as only one player is sending an image. If both try to send an image at the same time, the picture comes out garbled and nonsensical, because they'd sorta mix together by the time they got to the TV.

If Person C were to show up and acquire the skunk from A, then B and C could morph it side by side and again have no issue, because A's tissue would still just be sitting there under the B/C tissue, dormant, doing nothing. But if A were to morph the skunk while the others were in it, then B and C would both have issues.

'“Obrigado pela su participação.' - 'Agradecemos a sua participação.' - (su isn't a word.)

'Há apenas mais algumas verificações de segurança antes de concedermos entrada ao Departamento de Cooperação Interplanetária.' - 'Antes de prosseguirmos à Secretaria de Cooperação Interplanetária, estaremos realizando algumas verificações de segurança.' (It moves the phrase for gerund, because that's what we do here, don't ask me why.)

Por favor, seja paciente. - The phrase is correct, but it comes as confrontational, in a passive-agressive way. 'Novamente, agradecemos a sua cooperação.' (Once more, we thank you for you cooperation.)

  “Para este teste, pedimos que você encontre um lugar confortável para se sentar no chão, a pelo menos um metro de distância uma da outra. For this test, we ask that you please find a comfortable place to sit on the floor, at least one meter away from each other person.”
#+end_quote

'Pedimos aos participantes que sentem-se no chão, confortavelmente, com ao menos um metro de distância uns dos outros.' (Keeps on an impersonal 'We ask' which is assume is what you were aiming for.)

** "We awoke from disconcerting dreams, from visions as crisp and clear as memory-"

As Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed into a gigantic vermin.

I was expecting and mildly hoping this would be a trip to the land of the Iskoort, but was having trouble imagining how they would be relevant if they are as distant as implied in canon, and lo, it was another planet which I am also happy to visit.

  “The device was developed *after* our second greatest failure,” he said. “During the battle on the Yeerk homeworld, a single Andalite was made Controller, and the resulting betrayal of our species' secrets led to the destruction of the thirteenth fleet. Alloran's Fall, on the tail of Seerow's Kindness.” Opening the compartment, he reached inside and withdrew a small, blue cube

#+end_quote

We know from one of Esplin's POV chapters that he's pre-committed to preserving the dog planet untouched forever. So was giving Tobias the Chee device part of what he got in exchange, or has he not actually made a deal with them yet?

Also, what's the deal with Rachel? Is the fact that the Chee don't remember her name, and she's apparently exempt from their anti-violence rules, connected to her being, "not supposed to be there" in the eyes of the gods? It would make sense for a super-intelligence to want to corner the market on brain emulation ASAP, and so far the only conscious machines we've seen are the morph computer and the Chee (and the gods themselves). Maybe they're not actually separate technologies?

** May be a bit late but I thought I'd post here cuz it's more relevant to this chapter: It's notable that this time when the ellimist appeared to the group, they were not in morph. So the mechanism by which it appeared to them this time and materialized the gun is different from the time at the pool, where it was all in their minds. Also notable is that no mention of time stopping this time around either.

My guess is that the smurf Yoda avatar is an actual creature this time created the same way a morph construct is created. The gun as well. Just to clarify where does the mass for morph constructs come from? Z-space? It's not being created from nothing I hope!
