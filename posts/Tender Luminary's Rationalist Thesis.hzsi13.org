It's wonderful to be writing under a legitimate metapop literary movement. But I feel that requires me to offer my thoughts on the philosophies before you know to engage with my work on the level I'm crafting.

​

Rationalist Fanfiction is descended from *Eliezer Yudkowsky*'s *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*. I won't give you a whole wikipedia preamble, you should be up to speed through this part. There's a lot I could say, and might say about our specific descendence through this work and its specific themes but there's one element that needs pulling out here.

​

Yudkowsky wrote not just a "rationalist" reconstruction of *Harry Potter*, but such a reconstruction through the lens of its fanfiction. The degree to which he succeeded is down to his inexperience and, honestly, lack of innate skill in this magisterium. There's a lot of negative analysis you could make of E.Y. but that's not at all what this community should be about - this community is about honoring that intention and how its flowered in the years since HPMOR ceased publication

​

Most strikingly of course is that if Methods could be considered *The Hobbit* of this nascent poprationalist mythoconstruction, it received not only a more serious and evenhanded continuation in *Significant Digits* by *Alexander Davis*; but a veritable *Silmarillion* in *Orders of Magnitude* by *Nanashi Saito.* A fanfic of a fanfic of a fanfic, of fanfic culture to comment on Harry Potter culture to comment on scientific culture. Quite the whimsical telescope to the collective unconscious.

​

You could write such paragraphs about any of the works I see boosted here every week, assumedly even the ones I don't read. I have lots to say about *Animorphs: The Reckoning* by *TK-17 Studios* to the point I'd call it Methods of Rationality /done right;/ except I'm not nearly widely read enough to know if it might pale in comparison to a fanfic of something I'm less into.

​

But one work that burns with its own importance to our infant genre is *Chili and the Chocolate Factory* by *GaizeMaize*. One criticism leveled at Methods that the rationalist genre can't shake is that it flattened the wonder and potentiality out of the parent work, at the same time as it was trying to draw those out in its own way. This is one reason I prefer Reckoning as the didactic ratfic Eliezer couldn't quite attain; its series practically being built on the themes and messages of our movement.

​

But that dissonance is part of what Yudkowsky was trying to capture, and manages quite evocative moments in this area when his efficiencies as a communicator come together. GaizeMaize not only avoids jarring the reader as Yudkowsky could not, but actively revels in matching his parent work absurdity for absurdity. I'm still sitting here thinking about bits of it wondering... did he actually mean for me to be thinking this? Was he writing on this level? Or did he just make fondant that doesn't taste like shit?

​

I want to let my work stand on its own, except for replying to comments here. But in writing *Rational Banjo-Kazooie* I'm delighted to envision a Silmarillion-level take on GazeMaize's lategame concept of "abstraction". I will never know exactly how he conceived the cosmological mechanics and that's part of the point of the element in the work; part of the point of this genre is taking an idea like that and running with where it explodes in your mind. I hope you will join me


** My go-to "rationalist fic done right" is generally Pokemon: The Origin of Species. Exploring the themes of how people think, how we weigh risks, etc, without the same arrogance. A different kind of arrogance, perhaps, but if so, a much softer kind than HJPEV.

I did read quite a bit of Animorphs: The Reckoning, but eventually wasn't enjoying it enough to continue (I vaguely recall the Visser using Leeran Hypersight to ambush the heroes although it was confusing).
