*** On the other hand, the Hierarch isn't actually very relevant in the immediate situation except possibly for getting another horde of peasants into the battle at an unexpected moment.

He's a revolution in a bottle, an early revolution works in cities and other places where they have overwhelming numbers. The Hierophant is a "bring down the lords" type of guy, when an army like that comes across professional soldiers in the open field they always lose in the beginning.

** What if, WHAT IF, the Princes' Graveyard isn't caused by Cat, but it's actually Hierarch putting them all on fuckin' trial?

I just blew my own mind and guaranteed it wouldn't actually happen, but that would be hilarious.

** Cat cannot have a draw with Pilgrim since that would set up a pattern of three, but what if she /lost/? Malanza needs a "victory" here to prevent the peasant revolts that the Augur foresaw, but that doesn't necessarily have to do with a battle between armies.

So what if Cat uses herself to buy time for her army to retreat, setting herself up for a heroic stand, and then allows herself to be captured by Pilgrim who will then force her abdicate as punishment. That's a victory for Malazna, a loss to break the pattern, and something that Cat has been planning to do this entire time anyway.

Cat would need some sort of failsafe to prevent them from just killing her when she "loses", and I don't see how this will give her leverage over the Grand Alliance. Also, this doesn't account for Kairos at all, so maybe a separate scheme there? Maybe the portal to Arcadia rips open at the last moment before they can kill Cat after her "loss", and this will force Cat, Pilgrim, and maybe Kairos to team up to defend against it. Teaming up with the familiar villain against the greater evil is a classic trope that Cat can swing in her favor, although this would cut very close to a redemption arc that Cat would need to avoid.

*** She can't lose because can only be Warlord of Callow with a string of victories.

I think it's mentioned in an earlier chapter

**** I think she's overstating a bit how bad a single loss would be for her reputation.

People went to the street and called for blood when she was declared Arch-Heretic. People are sharing stories about her going to Keter and setting the place on fire. They already loved her when she was a blatant patsy for Malicia, and now she's dictating terms to continental powers. It would take way, way more than a defeat to shake her legitimacy in Callowan eyes.

**** Huge loophole here - the plot only cares about narrative victories, draws, and defeats. Her reputation only cares about /military/ defeats. She has to lose a battle of wits, or a one on one combat, or something that's not broadcast to the entire country.

** Pilgrim's victory condition virtually requires Malanza to win a battle against Cat. Cat wants everyone to walk away without losing too much, and without a draw. Preferably while gaining leverage to implement the Accords and getting Black's soul. And Kairos wants truce talks for some unknown reason.

Although...rebellion might not occur if popular opinion shifts...

Kairos has some unknown source of information. What if they predict when/where a chunk of Arcadia comes into Creation, devils attack Malanza, then the Army of Callow comes in and saves the day?

Seems unlikely; too many points of failure. But it's unlikely that Cat would accept a loss against Malanza; too much risk of one of them being taken out of the playing field...

I suppose they could convince Kairos to attack Malanza, then betray him. Though Kairos may not want to attack, and might actually try to betray them first...
