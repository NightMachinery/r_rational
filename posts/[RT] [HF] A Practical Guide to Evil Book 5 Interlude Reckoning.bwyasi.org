** Oof. Did Neshemah really think that trying to possess one of, if not the strongest sorcerer on Calernia and then killing his love in front of him would end well?

I guess I've been attributing Black/Cat's ability to see and manipulate stories to every player of a certain level of sophistication, but the Nessie really seems to overestimate the degree of control he can exert by getting directly involved.

****** I see what you're saying. My impression was that there was no such thing as full/complete power. There's only the power you manage to accrue, minus the power of stories, minus the power of opposition.

The more power you manage to accrue, the more the power of the story is gained against you, and thus as an opposition. That's 99% of the reason why Black managed to do so well, he never accrued power actively, he did it passively. Like a person would do it politically, not through a Name. The universe can handle Name-aquisition, but it does not understand PR and politics. If that makes sense.

Neshamah has enough power over Masego to make him do what he wants, up until the point where the story says he's gone far enough. That's when Masego and Indrani's story takes over

I am thinking that Masego is going to get worked on one of the abused/used/outraged tropes (which this subreddit has had me reading far too much). There will be happenings

** I'm a bit disappponted in Nessie here. Much praise has been heaped upon him for surviving thousands of years by never giving the Plot an openning. He was raised up as the (un)living epitome of the Sun Tzu passage, paraphrased, "To secure yourself from the possibility of defeat lies within your power. The opportunity to defeat your opponent lies with him."

I really hope that Nessie has some scheme at work here that we aren't seeing, or this turns the only thing that made him actually scary into an informed ability. I don't expect him to play the entire thing flawlessly. He has to be defeatable in the end. A mistake this big, though, is straining my suspension of disbelief.

In other words, I notice that I am confused...

*** This is the same mistake that has been shown just a few chapters ago though, when he failed to account for Kairos' personality - that the Dead King assumes everyone of a certain level will act rationally. This is only worsened by his apotheosis, which we know from both Sovereign of Winter Cat being extremely stuck in her violent ways and Sve Noc having Cat as their advisor to avoid this exact situation railroads you into thinking a certain way.

In case of the Dead King, who sacrificed his entire kingdom for power, this tunnel-vision as it were is that people with certain level of power behave rational and practical at most times, always looking for the most beneficial option.

Here the mistake was that due to the Pilgrim being close at hand Indrani will most certainly be resurrected by him. Every one of the heroes knows this, the Dead King knows this, and, since Masego can see what's going on now, Masego himself will almost definitely also realise that the Pilgrim is going to resurrect Indrani seeing as they appear to be on the same side.

So from a rational point of view all the Dead King did was dissuade Indrani from interfering since, well, death has no consequence this one time. It's quite literally a warning shot. And he assumed Masego would see this as well, and not risk himself trying to fight off the Dead King in his soul.

Unfortunately he underestimated (once again partly caused by his apotheosis) that human relationships can cause people, even highly intelligent and powerful ones, to behave quite irrationally. I assume next chapter Masego is going to attempt something very risky that will put his life and soul at risk to fight the Dead King off, something he would never do in a right frame of mind, which is why the Dead King thought it ludicrous for him to do.

*** When you undergo apotheosis you lose what makes you human in order to gain what makes you divine, this includes the ability to truly learn. I think Nessie is just a bit behind on how tight and loyal to each other the Woe are. He hasn't been around for the Calamity's reforms so he probably expects them to be as loyal to one another as villains normally are. That, and while he is extraordinarily cautious and intelligent, he is only risking part of his soul and one plan. This is a loss, and a permanent one, but he's not beaten by a long shot.

*** It is also possible that killing Archer was his best move there even knowing how Masego would react to seeing her dead, and he'd planned to conceal that fact; it seems like Bard did something to clear Masego's sight, there at the end, and that may be something that the Dead King didn't realize she could do.

A living Indrani would probably have been even more dangerous to the Dead King's control over Masego than a dead one, honestly. Once she made it inside the circle, there was nothing stopping her from snapping him awake in some dramatically appropriate way (confession of love, kiss, whatever), and I suspect the weight behind that would have made it harder for Nessie to conceal from Masego. A quiet, clean kill and an illusion let him put off the moment of realization for a few crucial moments to finish his investigation into the Bard, after all.
