Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Some time back I'd asked for advice on rank order decisions for prospective cities to move to for my wife's residency. The results came back a few days ago -- it looks like we're going to Palo Alto, CA! With that uncertainty out of the way, a greater uncertainty rises up to take its place: finding me a job D: if I can't manage to secure an appropriate postdoc somewhere, plan B has always been to explore industry data science positions (put my first resume together last night!). I hear this "Bay Area" is quite flush with tech opportunities, so is anyone here experienced in navigating its job market and willing to share advice? Things you wish you'd known before applying to places? Common mistakes applicants in my position make (in short, coming from a PhD in Anthropology with a heavy focus on computational statistical methods development)?

** Been wondering about the intersection of video games and rational fiction. For story games, it's a boring question. But for system-based games, is it possible for one game to be more rational than another? For example, Baba Is You is a self-consistent exploration of some ideas that seem impossible on the surface, is that analogous to trying to make a coherent world out of something a bit loopy like Harry Potter or Pokemon? Consistency is cheap in a system running on a computer, but there are games that are deliberately inconsistent, mostly troll games like I Wanna Be The Guy. Are there more serious uses for inconsistency (that are still fun)? Could you make a game that initially appears to have inconsistent mechanics, then slowly resolves them into a consistent state?

*** Unfolding games (Candy Box 2, A Dark Room, Frog Fractions, etc.) could fall into the category of "seriously utilising inconsistency", maybe. They centre around having the game mechanics shift as you progress through the game.

For "inconsistency that resolves into consistency", I can't think of any games, but the best piece of fiction that I've seen do that would be Problem Sleuth, followed by Homestuck. Various strange mechanics of the world are exploited in various situations.

Also, digging around the search bar found me [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5imb61/rational_video_games/][this thread]] from three years ago, which could still be relavent.

**** I'd argue that player uncertainty about the consequences of their actions is sometimes a good thing in horror games. In my experience, I'm most afraid during the times when I don't know enough about adversaries/mechanics to be able to game the system. That feeling quickly wears off once I've figured out the parameters of any given situation, and at that point the game becomes less enjoyable for me.

**** It happening now and then however can be a great source of humour or surprise. Undertale uses this to great effect - both breaking the assumed rules of the genre, the things you'd expect from a videogame in general (by going meta in many senses), and sometimes breaking its own rules (for example in boss fights, which often suddenly introduce strange, unique mechanics). It can actually afford to do it also because one of the things that makes it unique is that it actively incorporates the saving and reloading mechanic into its gameplay and role, and so "losing and having to retry" is literally part of the plan (and in fact what the in-world player character experiences).

*** What do you mean by inconsistency?

​

It seems like you've re-invented/discovered two notions of paradox:

a) an actual contradiction

b) an apparent contradiction

(In a more complicated way, there can exist ways of handling things which seem to make sense, but then break under complicated circumstances, and a different way has to be found/made (re-examining old premises at times) that still has the desired properties (like consistency).)

*** I mentioned in another comment Undertale as a great example of inconsistency used for narrative purposes. You have stuff like Toriel dying immediately after your first attack that is designed to catch you unaware and trick you. The game plays around with you quite a bit.

Not sure about a seemingly inconsistent game actually making more and more sense as time goes. I don't see why it should be impossible, but it's hard to think how exactly it might look like. It'd be interesting though. Especially if you get to experience the feeling of slowly figuring out this seemingly crazy world and finding a logic in it.

** There's a lot of discussing and squabbling around on scientific/academic Twitter right now that's giving me a headache for how stupid the whole thing is. Basically I think it's rooted mostly in a massive misunderstanding - purely semantics - but because emotions are running too high no one is willing to simply calm down a bit and look at the thing for what it is.

Basically Richard Dawkins tweeted something along the lines of "of course eugenics programs are bad, but they should be argued against on the basis of ethical, not feasibility, arguments, because if you can select and breed animals of course you could do the same for humans - it just requires things that we should NOT DO to humans". Here's the full tweet sequence:

[[https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/1228943686953664512]]

This has turned immediately into a massive "Richard Dawkins supports eugenics" based on the fact that him using the words 'it would work' is taken as a moral endorsement, not just an assessment that it would succeed /at the goals that it sets itself/, not that the goals are morally good. Pretty much everyone is screaming bloody murder and frankly it's stupid as fuck. I actually think we could really use in a lot of fields a lot more distinction between the scientific and the ethical. In lots of situations when people drag science to support their position they actually miss the point (e.g.: bringing up neurology/embryology to defend abortion with someone who literally thinks the worth of human life is defined by God and thus does not care for it being rooted in materialism at all, which means no science in the world will budge them), and all this leads is to further politicisation of science with little or no progress on the actual issue. It might be part of why we're so screwed and polarised over climate change, in fact.

** The last episode of the Magicians had a time loop with the cause being a primordial being released. I just thought it funny with Mother of Learning recently ending and all.

I can't really recommend the Magicians (tv show, haven't read the books) much, but it has its moments! Stuff often happens semi-randomly without proper foreshadowing. It has problems with tone, i.e., funny one moment, serious the next without proper (for me) transition. What annoys many, I think, is that the protagonists are causing more problems than they solve (opposite of the sidebar ;) ), are depressed, annoying, useless or broken in other ways etc. but that is what makes it unique.

*** You should put in some spoiler tags.

I've been pretty sick the last week, and watching The Magicians, currently somewhere in season 3. It's much different from the books, which it would pretty much have to be, but has come into its own, and features some cool/clever/funny/whimsical stuff often enough that I'll keep watching.

The books, on the other hand, are probably my favorite works of fantasy, though I almost never recommend them to anyone, since a large part of why I liked them is that they resonate with my personally, something I don't think is likely true of other people. Also, I read them all as they came out, and while the second book elevates the first, the third /really/ elevates the first and second, so it's kind of a "it gets better!" thing, except that I loved the first book for what it was when it was written. (The author grew with the books, and there were long gaps between them for that reason.)

I'm sure it comes from literature. If I had to guess, saying it can't get any worse comes from literature et al originally as a way to introduce extra tension when it does in fact get worse. Or a way of showing that the characters are emotionally unprepared from the tension. Then the device gets overused and everyone now has expectations of things getting worse when someone says it.

​

Also the idea of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris][universe punishing people for overconfidence]] / ambition is much older than that. As for that, the superstition that you shouldn't upset society or you will get punished for it is a socially useful way of reinforcing norms.

*** Anime: last year's "Kanata no Astra" is pretty lighthearted and not very hard as sci-fi goes (there's FTL travel and alien biology that's a bit too close to terrestrial one), but it still has a lot of interesting concepts, and an overall mystery plot that's very well planned and wrapped up satisfyingly. One of those cases where you genuinely have the hints to figure out a lot of stuff from the beginning, but you don't notice until it's slammed right into your face.

** So, I've been in the Bay Area for the past week... and been horrifically sick the past week. In fact, the only day I wasn't sick was the first day I arrived here where I had a very pleasant meal and walk/chat with [[/u/callmesalticidae]] , who is just as kind and interesting as you'd expect. (God I hope you didn't get sick from being around me)

It's been pretty disappointing, to be honest, as I was looking forward to seeing Oakland and Berkeley and instead I saw... Tenderloin, which is where I booked a hotel in my infinite wisdom.

I'm beginning to recover now and I'm on to my way to Vegas this evening, so hopefully I'll be feeling okay soonish.

That said, while sick I was able to do the following:

- See the sea lions, TWICE
- Go to alcatraz, which was very well organised, though parents taking photos of their children in the cells was cringy
- See the SF production of Hamilton, which was awesome especially because it didn't require me to do anything other than sit down like the lump I was
- Eat some good but not great food
- Saw the Survivor Season 40 Premiere on TV, THOUGH BECAUSE I WAS SICK I MISSED OUT ON GOING TO SOME INTERNET RANDOM'S HOUSE TO WATCH IT THERE (I promised callmesalticidae a write-up of Survivor, someday, to get you all just as addicted as me)
- Go to a Best Buy

So that's... not too bad. Even though this trip to the Bay has just been a very, very expensive way to recover from my illness (though no doubt less expensive than a single night in an American emergency room?).

Ha. We got a former jail here in Oxford that has been turned into a luxury hotel. It is quite the strange sight. It's still got the structure, with one big central space and the doors from all rooms at all floors facing this main hall, and was used as a jail I believe as late as the 1990s. But now you have to actually /pay/ to go sleep in it, and a pretty penny too, I think.

For each pair of cells, they took out a wall in between and made that into a single room. Now backpackers stay there.

(I think finally the outrage in the indigenous and non-indigenous community is making them close the hotel and convert it into a museum, but /gods/. Why do people think derelict prisons are "fun" and "quirky"?
