Sorry for the unusual length.

Half a year ago I asked for some input on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2d4dsp/wip_mk_bst_the_politics_of_limiting_access_to/][The politics of limiting access to magic]] in my world, and you lot forced me to rethink some things and slap on a few layers of paint on others. I am thankful for that input.

I now ask you to do the same with a more easily breakable aspect of my world. There is a place in it called the Altar of Oaths, and any oath spoken there binds you for as long as your soul survives. The context is as follows:

1. Non-magical technology is mostly at pre-industrial revolution levels. But because everyone can learn magic in my world (And is at this point in time forced to), it would be more accurate to say that functionally technology is closer to 19th century levels, with some areas being in advance of reality or flatly impossible. There is magical genetic engineering, chemical warfare, what is effectively a reusable nuke powered by mass human sacrifice, personal flight, near-perfect mind reading, resurrection of the dead whose bodies have been destroyed, etc.

2. There is a world war going on. There are two sides. The White Hand, who have sole access to the Altar of Oaths, and the Black Hand, who have a technological advantage because their ethics committees are chaired by rational!Mengele.

3. For those of you who remember anything about the previous thread, please put those memories aside, as this thread concerns the world before magic was restricted, and before the most powerful aspects of magic were sealed off.

4. Oaths taken on the altar are binding for all time or until your soul is irretrievably destroyed. You cannot plot to put yourself in a position where your oath cannot be upheld. You can swear any number of oaths, but none that to the best of your judgement would go against any oath you have previously sworn. If they do clash, earlier oaths win out. You cannot choose to fail to act if you expect that doing so would prevent you from fulfilling your oath. Even if your memory of taking the oath is erased, the oath still binds you. Generally though, even thinking about future actions will reveal that you absolutely will or won't do x, so you can usually work out what oaths may have been erased from your memory. The oaths do not let you go beyond your limits, they just force you to try your very best to uphold them. If you simply /fail/ to uphold them, well that sucks. Swearing never to have your mind read doesn't help if you get knocked out and can't stop them, though it might make you suicide if the alternative is being captured.

5. There is exactly one way to remove an oath. There is a magic in my world that can destroy souls. With extreme skill, it is possible to destroy less than the whole soul. With sufficient finesse you can irretrievably destroy anything from specific memories to personality traits to the capacity to feel empathy to habits to Oaths. People who have taken an oath will resist having those oaths undone with everything that they have, for the oaths will not let them allow the procedure. Of course if the oath is "I will obey X without question," then X could order you to allow the oath to be undone.

6. It is not possible to swear an Oath while mind controlled, and being in the location makes you intuitively aware that any oath would be binding. However, you could drug or torture someone, and they would still be bound by any Oath they swore.

That's all there is about the oath, but I think I need to give you more about the world. The world war does not begin on a small scale. The leaders of both Black and White were forced (By Oaths, no less) to cooperate and refrain from plotting or deceiving each other until a certain world-ending threat was dealt with. Now that that threat is dealt with, the leaders of the Black really, really want to take over the world. They also want to bump each other off so they don't have to share Absolute Power with each other, but they recognize that they can't have too much infighting until they have destroyed the White leaders. The leaders on each side are bound by Oath never to tell a direct lie. The White could undo this Oath with the soul destroying magic, but the Black could not.

The Altar could be captured by the Black, but it is the White's seat of power, so if that happened the war would be hopelessly lost anyway.

If the Black's seat of power is taken, the war is similarly won, since the reusable nuke runs on dying wishes, and more people would be prepared to die to kill Hitler than would be prepared to die to kill Eisenhower. The nuke is more limited than that, so it would not work to raise someone in isolation and train them to want to kill person X, but the uses for the nuke is outside of the scope of my question, so I won't expand on it unless asked.

What I want from you is all the ways that you could imagine abusing the oaths. Some things are obvious, like making it impossible for people with key information to divulge it to the enemy, or making loyalty to the 'good' leaders absolute. The Black do have access to the soul destroying magic, but oaths that force your people to destroy their own souls if they would otherwise be captured would be hard to get around. Discipline problems and shortcomings in personality in the leaders themselves could be cured as well, and it's this kind of self-rewriting where I suspect most of the ideas I haven't thought of might be hiding.

Lastly, there is one location where your soul is immediately destroyed if you knowingly tell a lie, and while it is far from the Altar it is in one of the regions of the world where the fighting is most intense, so both sides try to hold it when they can, and they occasionally negotiate there. It's not a lie if you sincerely believe it though, and nothing stops you from having an ally rewrite your beliefs and memories before going there.

.

A summary of magic in my world, since the oaths are mostly taken by powerful magicians:

It's elemental. There are no 'schools' of magic like in Dungeons and Dragons. There are no spells, no metamagic. If you have to have a reference point, the original Avatar series has similar spell-less forces of nature that are controlled. Though in my world there are five elements (Fire, Air, Earth, Thunder, Water), and everyone has access to all five, with maximum potential in each depending on their personality.

Passionate people are strong in Fire. Calm, methodical people are strong in Earth. Charismatic people are strong in Thunder. Perceptive people are strong in Water. Air is... strong in people who for some reason are favoured by destiny. Mostly people with strong beliefs and dreams, and those who have faith in higher powers (all the gods are dead, but whatever).

Fire is extremely destructive, to the point where one fire expert can probably take on five magicians of similar strength in any other element and wipe the floor with them in a straight fight, leaving the battlefield a firestorm. Thought the other five probably have some decent Fire between all five of them, so most likely everyone dies. ...My world doesn't see a lot of straight fights.

Water bends time and probability, and the most powerful Water magicians can see seconds into the future, and have a supernatural intuition for how to manipulate people. In addition to flinging lightning around, Thunder magicians have supernatural likability and the power to read surface thoughts without effort, with the most powerful ones being able to rewrite memories and sensory intake in those around them in real time, with or without their cooperation. If they get a good hit in they can straight up take over your mind, although insanity usually sets in quickly in the victim unless it's done subtly and precisely. They also get genetic engineering, including developing bacteria and viruses, and healing, which ranges from the disinfecting and sealing of wounds that almost anyone can do to regrowing organs and reversing the ravages of aging, which only half a dozen or so people in the world have the skills for.

Earth magicians can warp space and matter. Affect momentum. Some permanent alchemy and permanent transfiguration, but no temporary versions of either. Chemistry does work in my world, but for the most part it's not very far developed. The main exceptions being chemical warfare, where anything from napalm to mustard gas can be made. Gunpowder has also been discovered, and machine guns are around the corner. Computers show up in the later stages of the war, but only up to what reality had in the 1940-50s, and AI is limited to what the baddies get when they stuff the soul of one of their defeated leaders in there. Ie, I know very little about computers and don't see that changing very much.

Air magic is... The wildcard, I guess. It includes prophecy, and anyone strong in Air will have occasional dreams about their own immediate future, and about important events close in time (But not necessarily in space). Prophetic gifts also vary greatly between individuals, from being able to sense the presence of other souls to seeing how people are meant to die when they look at them to seeing what people could once have become, if some important turn in their life had gone differently. Prophecies can be averted, but the world will bend over backwards to make some things happen, and events important enough that they are dreamed of years in advance pretty much /have/ to happen, and it's a case of fulfilling them in the best way possible rather than averting them. For instance, a recurring nightmare shared by almost everyone with a decent potential for Air magic in them says that the reusable nuke is going to destroy the world in a few decades. Meanwhile, every time the Black use it it becomes a little bit stronger than last time, and isn't it funny how everyone who studies it keeps mysteriously disappearing or falling down stairs. The most powerful Air magicians also get the power to resurrect the dead (at extreme energy cost, making mass resurrections impractical), as well as the exciting power of growing just a little bit more powerful and insane every time they have a prophetic experience which they can't turn off. They also tend to lose touch with the here and now, immediate dangers and so on.

.

Notably my magic system does /not/ allow scrying, teleportation, gate-making, summoning, polymorphing, reversing time (ever) or restoring anything that Soulfire (the soul destroying magic) has destroyed, but largely anything else should be munchkinable, at least with enough research. At this point both sides have millions of people serving them. The White have the benefit of having more people siding with them voluntarily, the Black have the benefit of being quite happy to torture your children if you don't work hard enough. Though usually they'll ask nicely before making any threats, and most of the really bad things aren't common knowledge, and the rumours are just rumours, after all. Keep your head down. Love your gods. Remember you are mortal. (This sign is posted for the benefit of the servants, not for the actual rulers, who are very literally trying to blaze a path to absolute power and eternal empire.

The leaders of the Black Hand range from rational!Voldemort (with bewbs) to rational!Mengele (with bewbs) in likability, and use tactics ranging from rape dungeons with millions of prisoners to indoctrinated suicide bombers to the old standby constantly re-using the reusable nuke powered by mass human sacrifice. Lack of radioactive fallout makes this a little more sustainable, but they've already left about a continent and a half incapable of sustaining human populations with innovations like magic eating hydrophobic goo worms and a flesh eating moss that releases nerve gas.

So... If you were one of the leaders of the White, how would you get the most out of your one unique advantage, the ability to place binding oaths on your followers?

(Later on in the war, when it's starting to look the ever escalating research into ways of using magic for genocide might soon destroy the world, most of the world will come together to weaken what magic can do, but I figure it's easier to break things with unbreakable oaths /and/ forces of nature that can be tortured into reproducing anything you could get out of technology.

Notable physics differences between my world and reality: Thermodynamics is a guideline. Fire magic can create new energy. The soul destroying magic can also destroy anything material, although it's really exhausting. Unlike creating firestorms out of nothing, which mad people can keep doing for longer than most people would like. My world is flat, and the edge of the world is bordered by a vortex that is capable of lifting all the ocean water that flows out into it and flinging it back into the world near the edge as several-kilometer-long waterfalls. Not much lives near the edge. If you did somehow survive journeying into the vortex, it is in turn bordered by an inexhaustible storm of Soulfire, which does not care about man-made protection. There are also no stars in my world, so nights get dark (The sun is not made of gas).

...Wow. 13641 characters. If you read all that, thank you! This setting is /meant/ to spiral out of control, and the actual books I'm writing take place a few hundred years later, after the world was almost destroyed and humanity went back to the dark ages and murdered anyone who looked like they might be wondering where all the books went, because that will obviously end well.


** I'd guess this scenario results is a Cold War full of espionage. Direct warfare would escalate into nuclear bombing by Black.

So White should develop a horrible doomsday device to counter the nuclear bomb threat. Like redirect the edge-soulfire into all of the world. Then some controllers take an oath when and how to do that. Let Black read their minds. Oaths + mind reading is a perfect pre-commitment device. This essentially nullifies Black's direct attack power. It also means Black must work around arbitrary limits for winning, like "We destroy the world, if White leader is assassinated".

If White is unable to create a doomsday device, maybe they can fake it? Since you need to destroy the world anyways, this might simply the doomsday device activating, though.

You are not clear about the goals of White. World peace I assume. So the final goal is get all Black leaders take an oath you control. Thus, White needs to capture them, bring them to the altar, and force them into an oath for world peace. Luckily, Oaths are really great for espionage.

For one, you can perfectly turn any enemy spies once you capture them. Combine with memory erasure spells to hide the turning from Black. Is memory erasure the same as soul destruction? Then accumulating memories/experience means your soul grows?

For White's own spies them same procedure is great. Make them take an oath, the erase the memory of the oath from their minds. Perfect sleeper agents.

How would Black counter this spy superpowers? Probably lots of horrible tortures and tests to check for various unknown oaths. For example, immigrants must meet with illusions of the leaders to reveal any sleeper assassins who awake once near a Black leader. All naive direct attacks can probably detected this way. This means White must come up with a convoluted complex (cinematic) plan to capture leaders. Combined with the problems of exfiltration, this would make for a nice story in itself.

*** And here I thought the last few steps leading up to an apocalypse were non-obvious. The good guys in the actual books will go the pre-commit to destroy the world route, but the White Hand chose instead to weaken the presence of magic in the world to stop the escalation from going too far, which also stopped the nuke (temporarily). Until then the nuke is used over and over again, and the White can't really stop it short of spreading themselves thin and keeping their leaders in protected locations, of which there are very few. Oaths plus mind reading do make for wonderful games of Chicken though, and will certainly feature.

The White do have personal goals, but their main goals are to keep the world from getting destroyed and to take down the Black, by any means necessary (And prevent any other psychos from arising, I guess). Making the Black take Oaths would be insufficient as they could be freed from their oaths in their sleep by someone sufficiently skilled with the soul destroying magic. Realistically they must have their souls destroyed so they can't be resurrected.

Memory erasure can be done perfectly with the soul destroying magic, but such skill is rare, and more commonly you simply rewrite the brain with subtle mind control. Technically possible to reverse, but possible like brain surgery was possible a hundred years ago. Ie, success rates are not great, and when things go badly the mind does not fare well.

My world does distinguish between the soul and the brain, but it gets technical and spoilery. Think of the soul as a sufficiently good copy of the brain that you could remake a destroyed brain from the imprint it made on the soul.

The Black has some ability to detect spies. Not perfectly, but as they have access to supremely effective mind reading they can race along with your stream of consciousness, as well as dig into your memories as well as you could yourself, and force you to consider scenarios and thought experiments, and force you to contemplate actions. This is resource intensive, so there is no way they could check everyone all the time, but crucial personnel can be checked hourly if necessary, and the Oaths leave a visible enough mark on those who swear that you couldn't have sleeper agents pass an inspection by the most powerful mind readers. Such mind readers are far between though, so the spies are certainly a fantastic advantage, and carefully worded oaths can wreak havoc where less skilled mind readers can be fooled.

Thank you for your time!

***** Thanks! As I've said at other places in the thread, the actual books take place a few hundred years after this war. It'll build back up to world war levels of magic warfare, but I don't feel confident I could start in the middle of such a massive conflict and do it justice.

I have maybe 90% of a first acceptable draft of the first book. Just have a hole in the middle to fill.

Doesn't sound like. Sounds like all your mages are glass cannon; if a Fire and Water mage start arguing, the Fire mage is probably going to be the one to throw the first firestorm...except the Water mage will see it coming seconds in advance and shoot him. Ditto for other types -- whoever shoots first is going to win.

Also, "The White Hand" and "The Black Hand"? Is anyone ever going to name themselves "The Black Hand"? That's pretty clearly a villain name, and no one thinks of themselves as the bad guys. Also, it sounds like the Black Hand are trying to conquer the world for the Evulz; consider coming up with a better motivation. Maybe they have had the prophetic dreams of the nuke destroying the world and they tried to work with the White Hand to prevent it but there was too much friction, so the only option to save the world is for them to control everything. Or maybe the Black Hand was a monarchy / some other form of autocracy / theism / secular nation and the White Hand tried to forcibly impose democracy / atheism / religion on them "in the interest of saving the people"? Or maybe they share a religion and one side has been bogarting the equivalent of Jerusalem, so this is a war of religious freedom? Just because there is a non-evil reason for them to be taking over the world doesn't mean you can't have rational!Mengele in charge (or, at least, as a high officer).

Okay, exploiting the oaths. My understanding is that the oath doesn't give you any extra skills or knowledge, it just requires you to do something to the best of your ability.

1.  Criminal recidivism is no longer a thing. If you are convicted, you take an oath to go straight.
2.  Political scandals are no longer a thing. When you take office you take an oath to be moral, upstanding, and to serve the nation selflessly.
3.  Traitors in the military, also no longer a thing.
4.  Traitors in any position of trust, no longer a thing.
5.  Corporate scandals, not a thing. CEOs and senior officers take an oath to serve the stockholder's interests second to those of society. You'll need careful phrasing on that one.
6.  Every single person in the nation takes an oath to be completely open and honest in court, should they ever end up there. Judges take an oath to be fair and impartial. Lawyers take an oath to not overcharge, and to do at least N hours of pro bono work per year so that poor people can have access to good representation too.
7.  Everyone takes an oath to get at least 1 hour of exercise per day and not overeat. Boom, goodbye obesity and much of diabetes. (handwave, thyroid conditions, etc, handwave)
8.  Everyone takes an oath to go to the doctor once a year and the dentist twice a year. Boom, massively reduced health care costs.
9.  Everyone takes an oath not to murder, steal, rape, become addicted to anything, etc. You'd need an escape clause for military service.
10. If you want to get edgy you could make citizens take an oath of "I shall not discriminate" in order to get rid of racism, sexism, and classism. That's dodgy and failure-prone, though.

*** Is there a logistics problem? You plan to have millions of people take multiple oaths, most certainly at multiple times in their life. Since there is no teleportation, travel is a burden. Is it really worthwhile to send someone to another continent to take on oath to go to the dentist? How many oaths per day is the throughput? For [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba][comparison]]: "In 2013, the number of pilgrims coming from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform hajj was officially reported as 1,379,531."

***** The economic and social implications are interesting. It is surely not feasible to replace each and every contract with an oath, but for important contracts (multi-million $ deals, big lawsuits, political campaigns) it seems necessary. This means a very centralized society. Every enterprise, every court, all of government is concentrated at the capital city with the altar. The rest of White's realms is second class, because nobody with ambitions would want to live there.

Also, I imagine a certain social stigma if you refuse to take an oath or maybe even if you never took an oath. Are you really a reputable citizen if you never swore an oath? There is probably also a counter movement of philosophers and anarchists see the bad effects of the altar. Maybe sponsored by Black?

Do you have to pay for access to the altar? Certainly, demand is very high and waiting queue long. So rich and influential people have easier access. Thus, taking lots of oaths is a display of power. So rich kids make bindings oaths for party games, while the middle class waits months to make contracts binding, and the poor ignore it.

****** I had not given thought to people paying for access to the altar. Certainly it is controlled by the military, but life must go on even in war times, so I imagine I will make it so that people can apply for oaths for non-war related reasons. The White don't have a perfect society, but I don't think I would let it be a privilege of the rich. Though travel there from far away would be. Hm. I guess life isn't fair.

Certainly there is a massive stigma against anyone who has not sworn any oaths, though that would only be close to the Altar. Further away it would be a mark of distinction to have taken an oath, but not something most could do. You might fly someone there if it was really important, but there are no airplanes, so we are talking using highly trained military personnel to transport one or a few people at a time, likely for a whole day, or two if you have to bring them back again.

True. I did say my world is short on straight fights. Water experts can see anything coming, but you usually only get really good with one element, and knowing that all the air in the room is going to ignite in three seconds isn't much help if you don't have the incredible skill with Fire it would take to redirect all that incoming energy. You can create heat in my world, but only the most powerful Fire magicians can destroy it without moving it somewhere, and the Fire expert can keep going until the steel walls and ceiling around you melt, which isn't going to take very long. But yeah, barring exceptional skill differentials or being far outnumbered, whoever strikes a hit first just flat out wins.

The Hand names were assigned by historians afterward. Historians with very specific goals in mind. What they actually called themselves was "The True" for the Black Hand - because they did not have access to the Altar, and so it was common knowledge that they couldn't lie even if they wanted to, and the "White Hand" for the White Hand, because they wanted to slap the pure evil sticker on the opposition.

As for Evulz motivations, I have to say that the whole idea when I started to design this world was to make villains that I like. That said, they do have complex personalities. We'll see what people think of them when they show up in the actual text, but the motivations of the five original leaders of The True go something like:

Exuro, the Wildfire King: He started out good, and he has the prophetic gift of being able to see kindness and empathy in others. But he was raised to follow an authoritarian religion, and there was little room in those teachings for judging people by intentions or love for their fellow man. He was forced to take part in a war against the last people of another faith, and try as he might, he could not turn off the ability to see the good in those he had to destroy. Because his prophetic abilities were fairly strong, he saw the best in every person he had to kill. Eventually he sort of... snapped. He began to see kindness as weakness, the letter of the law as the only thing that mattered. He began to try to eliminate the spark of beauty in those he conquered. When the enemy was finally defeated, the high priestess of that religion cursed him with a share of her own prophetic vision. He no longer saw only kindness in others, but also what they were 'meant' to become in time, if they lived long enough. Seeing not only that his faith failed to distinguish between kindness and cruelty, but also the immense potential that was being lost with every person he killed, he lost his religion. And that can do horrible things to someone who has already sacrificed so much for their faith. He came to see the world as a torture chamber. And indeed there is reincarnation in this world, so it is a torture chamber without end. But in facing the 'world-ending threat' before the War of the Hands, he came to see that his god was very literally real, and that the god was trying to end the world. His god shared his conviction that life was suffering, and that the suffering must end. So when his Oath no longer bound him, when he had helped murder the god he finally understood, he set out on his own quest to end suffering. And because his conviction is absolute, he cannot tolerate that spark of goodness he sees in those he meets; the world must be black, and anyone who thinks differently is just deluding themselves. So when he sees someone of exceptional kindness, or someone destined to be a force for good in the world, he tortures them and breaks them, until they beg him to let it all end. And so, one soul after another, the suffering ends.

Poena, the Cruel Mother: An orphan girl with some demonic blood in her (The race of demons have since been utterly wiped out, but a few half breeds still exist) who saw her mother be burned alive for the crime of being raped by a demon, and attacked whenever she approached a human settlement. She was found by a band of robbers and taken as a sex slave. They discovered she had an incredible potential for healing magic, and she gradually rose from slavery to being a concubine of the gang leader. With the development of her healing ability her charisma blossomed, and she managed to manipulate her master until she was the real power in the gang. She got the most problematic people conveniently killed and just flat took over. Then she grew the gang, and she found that while nobody would care for a girl with demonic blood or listen to her out of respect, they would obey her out of fear or hopes of sexual favour. So she grew her gang of outlaws, and she carved out her own little kingdom. When the world-ending threat came, she saw her opportunity to get a seat at the real table, and she proved her leadership abilities and her exceptional talents for healing. And in time, for genetic engineering. Most of the worst plagues and monsters and nightmarish things in the world came from her labs, and the more people feared her, the more powerful she grew. Her motivations are as simple as they are unfortunate. She trusts nothing but her own power, and she fears death and weakness. She wants to never die. She wants control. She wants /absolute/ control. Her end game includes rewriting everyone in the world with mind controlling cancer. She's the Mengele character.

Graven, the Last of Dragon Blood: The last human alive with the blood of the ancient race of dragons flowing in her veins. She ages very slowly, and was long the ruler of an old kingdom. From an early age she had prophetic visions of bringing back a lost age to the world, of gods and magic more powerful than the elements, and of destiny. She was brought down by Exuro's empire, and condemned to live for centuries in a dungeon until she died of old age. Eventually the world-ending threat emerged, and her prophetic powers being extremely strong, she was rescued by those who would save humanity at any cost, even be it serving those once condemned as evil. She used her prophetic abilities to turn the winds of the war in humanity's favour, and being once again in charge she saw renewed the visions of eternal empire and of destiny's completion. She doesn't have the ability to see into future as Water experts do, but her dreams and visions show her snippets of the future years ahead, of things that must be and things that must not. And in the shadow she weaves. Destiny must take its course.

Gyges, Inviolate: An inventor who cares little for world affairs, but who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is obsessed with his own safety. So while they didn't need him to take up a leadership role to start with, he made all his help against the world-ending threat conditional on ever more resources and scientists to control. He sits now on his throne in his extra-dimensional maze, laying traps and making weapons of war. He blinded and deafened himself to let his magical senses grow more acute. The others of the Black need him to make weapons for him, and honestly it would probably kill them to go after him anyway. He can wait until they have everyone else taken care of. In the end he won't be paranoid enough, and Graven will capture him alive, rewrite his mind to her liking, and stuff him into a machine so he can be an absolutely loyal machine mind and take care of her domain for her while she focuses on the war.

Remina of Otherworldly Grace: Alone among the Kings and Queens, Remina is not human. He is the brother of an otherworldly queen of Faerie. He was sent to the human world to aid in defeating the world-ending threat, and while here he found that he quite liked being number 1. He does not age, and so has a nice, cushy eternity to look forward to if he does not get himself killed. He sees the world as his own personal sand box, and in time, when the other nine leaders have been defeated, perhaps as a base from which to attack the world of his sister.

Melicia Seldon: Not an official leader. A bureaucrat who once made a mistake, and lost everyone she loved.

She is trying to change the nature of the "reusable nuke", which is called the Tower of Souls. If she ever succeeds, and it will take decades if she does, there will be nothing left of the world but fire. If she has any pleasure left in this life, it is in manipulating people to destroy everything they love.

2) Bioweapons are terrifying in the modern age, but your medicine seems pretty absurdly advanced. If people can regrow organs from scratch (and resurrection exists), there is at least a small pocket of people for whom bioweapons are not a threat. However, based on your description you made it sound like extreme healing powers are less common than extreme bioengineering powers. This means, in a no-holds-barred conflict, that basically everyone loses, unless the genetic engineering is good enough to turn humanity into rapidly mutating/reproducing things so that the immune defenses can stay sufficiently ahead of the pathogen offenses.

Country A launches bombs/suicides/whatever that infect solid seed populations of country B with the most horrifically weaponized smallpox imaginable. For each infected, the infection will naturally spread via every possible vector to another 100 victims on average. Symptoms don't appear for weeks, but it's contagious in days, and it's impossible to diagnose because it hides in the nervous system like herpes, so attempts at quarantine would be too late and mostly fail. Day 1: 400 infected. Day 5: 40,000 new infected (4400 total). Day 10: 4,000,000 new infected (4,044,000 total). By the time symptoms show, most of the world is infected, and promptly dies.

This isn't strictly accurate, it glosses over details and hurdles, but if you can make magic viruses it's going to be at least that bad.

*** 1) I am considering this. The thing is, the elements are ultimately /all/ poorly named, and named by humans. I intend to have them talk about this, and reveal that these are just the labels slapped on by early humans on forces they did not understand. You are however not the first one to bring this up, and it seems that a significant fraction of people who have given me their opinion really don't like me calling it Thunder. So... maybe. I do eventually want the reader to go "The characters should really stop thinking the elements have anything to do with the names they have," and I figured naming the seemingly-electricity one Thunder was a reasonable step, but... Maybe Lightning would do just as well. I just don't like the idea of having people use both lightning bolts and non-physically-manifest Lightning magic in a fight.

2) Genetic engineering is extremely powerful, but while it is in the domain of the element which must not be named, it is an application of it that requires time, and trial and error. It /is/ powerful, and while the best healers can keep key personnel almost perfectly safe, part of what happens during this war is that most of the world's population dies. Mostly from disease, with nuking and combat distant seconds. They go from a world population of around 100 million to maybe 2-3 million at the end of the war, all spread out, every city nuked, engineered monsters and plant life that used to be inconveniences left to grow until they render entire regions uninhabitable. Halfway through the war a magical seal will be put in place which weakens magic, removing genetic engineering as an option, but before then... Yeah. A lot of people will die.

Ultimately it will turn out that all the elements are constructed, and lightning is the force that controls and animates matter into life. Water is really Time and Potential.

** Take advantage of oaths... Lets get started.

First off, I don't have numbers for the sides, so I'm going to guess small, dozens and hundreds. Scale up. Go wild.

First I am going to grab two dozen really smart people. They will swear an oath to follow and research under the head of "Lab A" (give it a cool name, please) this oath will include the necessity to share all findings within the reports of the lab, and communicate with anyone the head of the lab designates.

The head of the lab will be given several oaths to find and learn about better tech, magic, oaths, etc. he will also have an alliegence oath and an oath about limits, he isn't allowed to start human sacrifice on a mass scale for example. The limiting oath will require him to go to me for requests, and to resubmit the requests as he sees fit, he won't take a no and just assume I'll never fund it.

3 hundred people. They are given oaths to move into Black Country and make friends, turn people and make sympathetic towns for the white.

5 hundred. Assassains. "I will do my best to kill the leader of the enemy. I will make no overt move and act as a perfectly loyal minion of the enemy for at least x (time period). Vary it. After the first few they won't be able to trust anyone.

Another few hundred. "I will become an agent of chaos when within enemy territory, I will look like an upstanding member of society and will not do anything where I can get caught"

"When in negotiations I will believe whatever I am planning on saying and I will say whatever X says to say." Bonus points if you make him able to read minds or otherwise communicate silently.

Those are the basics.

"I will not lie when I have heard the phrase "alphamajigger" an odd number of times total." Use this wording to turn off any oaths you don't want. Make another oath to never mention that part of the oath.

"I will design a better gun than what our armies are currently using."

Right there, already something I hadn't thought of. Thank you. It does have the disadvantage that the most powerful enemy magicians can read it in your mind if you know it yourself, but that can be circumvented, depending on the situation.

Both sides have between tens of thousands to millions of magicians, depending on how long things are allowed to escalate. The White have a numerical advantage, the Black have research. However, the White do have the ability to /trust/ their researchers, while the Black have to account for the possibility that their own minions might try to supplant them.

The Black's WMD can also be tuned to target patterns in soul. Usually they use it to wipe out blood relatives of their prisoners, but they could target people with the same oath instead.

(I realize that I'm adding new information, and your solution is appreciated. I just don't want to add too many rules for your consideration, since I'd get fewer people willing to read all this if it was even longer.)

It's possible to defend against the WMD, but not on a mass scale. So they can keep key personnel safe, but the vast majority of people under the White would be very vulnerable if the Black could get hold of a prisoner under a too similar oath.

********* The White will suspect the nuke can be used that way beforehand, and will avoid mass oaths. They can set up local protection, but they need powerful magic to anchor that protection to, so unless it's exceedingly important they can only really protect a few key locations. In those locations they can use any oaths they want, but other than that they go in with the expectation that almost anything can be used to make the nuke go after someone. Ie, sacrifice someone to the nuke and you can make it go after everyone with a closeish blood relation, or everyone they have a two-way strong emotional bond to, or everyone who lives in the city they grew up in, or everyone whose soul has been bent in a sufficiently similar way by Oaths... The Altar rewrites the soul, so there isn't an oath 'marker' written in, just patterns that weren't there before. The soul in turn forces the brain to behave according to the oath. So yes, if the Black successfully captures someone and manage to take them to their capitol, they can wipe out almost everyone with a very similar oath. They are wary of broadening the targeting, because as there is no 'marker' that identifies those with Oaths, they would risk killing a lot of people without oaths who just happen to be similar. The White tailor their spies to be as similar as possible to ordinary Black followers for this very reason. So... The Black can up the death count very quickly if they want to, but they are going to pay a high price in loyal followers if they do.

2) It's should be in mandatory use to make everyone perfectly disciplined and to eliminate akrasia.

3) Can you swear an oath that you will never follow any future oaths, unless you want to? If oaths conflict, then the earlier oath will win negating future oaths. This can block people from forcing you into oaths you don't agree with.

4) Key the oaths to triggers. There's an example somewhere on this thread that you can activate the oath for not lying when you hear a phrase. But this can be extended further by swearing an oath to try as hard as you can on a certain goal when you tell yourself "Goal Oath Activate For Goal [random thing that might involve petting a kitten]". Attach emotional trigger to an action to make yourself a good actor. Modify your personality by swearing oaths to be more charming, nicer, more brutal, more willing to kill in combat, etc, etc...

Air magic. The soul is separate from the mind, but there is a lot of bleed over in both directions, and your mind can be rebuilt from your soul if your brain has been destroyed (At prohibitive energy expenditure). The Oaths bind the soul, so even death and resurrection does not cancel the Oaths.

Almost exclusively. You could destroy the soul in other ways, like you could destroy paper with a shredder. Wouldn't be as complete as burning it. The Soul is a construct, and Fire can destroy everything that makes it up.

#+begin_quote
  Are all magical things decompositional into these five categories?
#+end_quote

No. The elements were put in place by beings of great power to limit the ways in which will power could warp reality. If five extremely robust locations operating on fairytale logic (one per element) were destroyed, magic would return to a freer state, and humans would be even more free to munchkin the world to destruction. If the human world itself was destroyed, magic would be freer still. Basically, the beings were gods, and wherever they warped the fabric of reality, they shaped the ability of others to do so too. Things that were done with magic before magic was made more limited persist as they were, however, so there are some objects that cannot be replicated without tearing down the five locations. The gods are dead now (We may have killed the last one just before this war started), but their influence lingers. Given sufficient scientific progress, and assuming we don't destroy the universe first, godhood can be attained, and while the word god is vague, I have in mind exactly how they came about and work. It's just /too/ spoilery to include in a post like this.

#+begin_quote
  Can Earth's Space-bending be used to travel?
#+end_quote

So this takes some explaining. Technically, you can use Earth to compress space in the direction you want to move, shortening the distance you have to travel. This takes an incredible amount of energy to do, however. So, if it was absolutely necessary to travel a short distance /right now/, you could bend space to do it, if you are very good with Earth. It is /very/ unsustainable, though, and you would be much better off in most situations just raising a wall of earth behind you and pushing that wall forward, carrying you with it. Doesn't work so well in cities, of course. There is also flight in my world, though flying with magic is highly impractical in battle, since you will have to spend a lot of your energy and concentration on keeping from crashing, plus with offense almost always beating defense, flying is an excellent way to get yourself set on fire from halfway across the battlefield. So neither Earth nor any other element is super useful for most travel (though flying a few kilometers up is usually safe). You can however use Earth, if you have sufficient manpower for it, to permanently stretch places to pack in more space or create perpetual motion machines (Water falls 100 feet, flows to the side, only has to rise 10 feet to be back at the top of the fall), etc.

If the five locations were to break, then you could use Earth to create portals. Given my characters, this would absolutely destroy my setting in at most a few days, so in my books, I don't intend on this happening until late into the final book.

** The obvious thing to do is to get your people to swear loyalty to the black.

Ok, so in order of priority your goals are.

1. Stop the nuke. The reusable nuke is going to destroy the world in a couple decades.

2. Ferment dissension within the ranks of the black so civil war can weaken them.

3. Destroy and weaken the armies of the black.

4. Destroy the civilian support for the armies of the black.

5. Achieve alliances with members of the black.

6. Enhance the armies of the white.

Onto the points. 1. So given that your top priority is to stop the nuke you need spies. Careful use of the oath can ensure people always give the correct answers, are loyal to the cause of the black, and will freely tell you everything you need to know and not reveal any information about the white to anyone.

You need to find where sacrifices are being gathered for nukes. You then need to find ways to disrupt it. Can you use genetic engineering and mind reading to disrupt it? Perhaps you can implant a mass mind suggestion into the sacrifices to have their dying wish be to slay some members of the black. Perhaps you can make them into beserkers who might kill the mages. Perhaps you can help them let you scry or die, by implanting radio devices in their bodies which communicate to you their location.

What would be an especially humiliating way to hurt nuclear bomb mages? Perhaps you could force them to take an oath to constantly empty their bladder and bowels and display them to the masses? Perhaps you could drug them into making an oath to devote their life to being a toilet for peasants in the street. That and torture, make being a nuclear bomb mage a very unpleasant career path for people.

You need to ferment chaos between the black leaders. 2. That means training fanatically strong mages, making them take oaths where they claim to be controlled by some black mage or other, and having them enact schemes, subtle and overt, against other black mages. Maybe they'll try an assassination and 'crack' under torture to reveal another black mage, maybe they'll steal civilians to set up a nuclear bomb against another black mage. Regardless, if questioned, they are loyal to the black due to their oaths. After

1. Nukes and

2. Dissension.

3. Make incompetent armies. Use your magic and oaths to create doppelgänger that can pass a casual inspection, replace people in enemy armies. Subtly encourage paranoia, dissension, vengeance, suicide, whatever you can to weaken the armies with corrupted leaders who literally can't say anything that indicates their loyalty to the white.

4. "Though usually they'll ask nicely before making any threats, and most of the really bad things aren't common knowledge, and the rumours are just rumours, after all. Keep your head down. Love your gods. Remember you are mortal." make this false. Have black oath'd servants. Explicitly and sometimes accurately tell people what the black intend to do with them, do such things to them, don't ask nicely. Ferment rebellions.

5. In the chaos some of the black are likely to seize a chance to even old scores. Create brainwashed oath bound dopplegangers of your own leaders, with similar magic and looks, who can promise particular black leaders that they don't care about their experiments and actions and that they'd be happy to ally with someone who helped them take out their enemy. And we're not expansionist no, we'd leave you alone if you left us alone. Although of course your research looks fascinating, we'd love to trade it for some of ours, privately of course.

I have the advantage of knowing who the (five) main leaders on each side and most of their successors are, and while it would drown you all in too much information to give you a bio on each of them, I already know roughly how the war develops, in which order I intend to bump them all off and when who is desperate, etc, so the ideas you mention stir concrete thoughts in me. Thank you.

**** The main thing about the oath is that it makes this cheap and efficient. If the black have to use countermeasures that slows them down, it means the mages have less mana, it means they are more stressed from paranoia, they're a bit less calmed down from friendships with other mages, and hopefully with the efficiency that the oath brings it means one mage can say tie up or weaken a dozen or a hundred mages on the other side.

It means you can turn enemy spy networks to support your goals too.

Anyway, yeah, increasing the volume of this is good. A fair fight, or even an unfair fight using fancy magical tricks is expensive. An unfair operation that makes others fight for you helps you win the logistics war.

Good luck with all that.

***** It's going to take a while to write, that's for sure. But, the books begin a few hundred years after this war is over, so I'm able to start off with a much smaller scale and then build up.
