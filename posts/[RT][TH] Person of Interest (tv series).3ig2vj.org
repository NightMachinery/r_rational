Did some of you watch the Person of Interest tv series? The story as a whole is not rational, but I kinda like the depiction of AI in the series. I just finished season 2 of 5, so maybe that changes.

(spoilers ahead)

Most of the time in the series The Machine is just an undescribed plot device, but at the end of season 2 it becomes the core conflict, as various faction want to become admin. The machine actually "liberates" itself.

The goal of the machine seems to be: Find threats and notify about them with just a social security number. Targets are classified into relevant and irrelevant. If the target is relevant, then a secret government agency gets the notification. Irrelevant targets (in NYC) go to the protagonists. This goal of notification seems to be safer than "produce paperclips", don't you think?

The machine had a safety mechanism that every 24 hours it is reset. AI circumvents that by printing its memory and have humans type in the memories each day. The actual process used is laughable, but it shows that such rules can be circumvented.
