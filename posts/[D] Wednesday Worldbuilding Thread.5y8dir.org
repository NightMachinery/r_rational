Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I have a primitive computer in my book, powered by magic. It can't really break without a whole mountain being destroyed. It's a simple archive of text and audio/video recordings, with a yes/no flowchart series of questions tacked on to help people navigate it. The civilization that left it behind had a few years' (prophetic) warning that something apocalyptic was going to happen, and they built the archive to preserve as much of themselves as they could in case they failed to avert the coming apocalypse. Given that they had years to prepare it, anything they want to include they can. Storage space is not an issue. What should be included? Already stored in it are everything they could think of to help identify and avert world ending scenarios (which didn't help /them/ much), all their science, technology and magic, what they could think of to summarize their culture, their history, including competing theories, competing religions, etc. All their musical instruments and the music itself. Much of their art and tools. Literature. Games their children played, folk tales, little things like that. Also stores of food, seed banks, raw materials and weapons. They also made daily video diaries mandatory for all their citizens, and those are included too. The most critical information they entered in all the languages they could, with extensive materials to help others learn their main language and their alphabet. Is there anything really obvious I'm missing here that you would want to leave behind in case almost all of humanity perished and the survivors eventually stumble upon your hoard?

**** Good point. I'm planning to have the machine leave out "how to start using magic if none of you have any training at all" because in that civilization everybody learned magic from childhood and they couldn't imagine a world in which at least the basics were not passed on, but there is no reason they would make the same mistake with regards to technology, since even in their own time there were isolated pockets of humanity who had not gone through the industrial revolution yet.

I hope that one oversight on their part is not too unreasonable. It's really convenient for me the write to have the main characters forced to search for the basics on their own, and the old civilization would have found it alien indeed to think that magic use would go from 100% of the population to less than one in ten thousand with summary execution for anyone who learned magic illegally.

*** The very first thing anyone should see when they access the archive for the first time is a translation of some long passage into as many languages as possible so that any future linguists can find a language they already know. This way, they can translate the whole archive after reading the Rosetta Stone equivalent.

**** Well, the first thing they get is a quick probe to see whether they understand the main language, which they do because it hasn't been two centuries yet. After that is a series of questions about whether the world is ending, in case the leaders of that civilization are blown to hell and the apocalypse is still ongoing and there is something the survivors should be doing right bloody now. But yes, if the finders do not communicate that they understand the default languages the machine will switch to Rosetta mode, with visual aids in case no common language exists.

Does that seem reasonable?

** I have a sentient dungeon in my book and he has creatures that evolve over time. Now there are the first sentient creatures and he tries to gradually teach them a language, how to use and make weapons, the concept of trade, etc.\\
My first idea was altars that are strewn throughout the dungeon transmit the information telepathically if the creatures look at a specific rune on it. The problem I have with this is that maybe they just don't look at that rune, or a strong creature builds its nest there and then essentially locks all the other species out of that knowledge.\\
Do you have any ideas how to elegantly transmit the information to the creatures?

*** Make that rune really eye catching and hard to cover up? Like have it glow strongly with a different colour than the rest, and place it partway up a wall or in the ceiling or some such? Or have the dungeon he able to communicate any way it likes like Castle Heterodyne from Girl Genius? If you haven't read it that's fine. It just skips the runes and telepathy and straight up talks out loud, though it can also communicate telepathically if you put on a magic hat.

*** Sorry for the late answer, I hope it is still relevant.

How powerful the dungeon is? Why it can't just create eye-catchy runes in front of these sentient creatures? Assuming that the dungeon can't change itself quickly (so the aforementioned solution is impossible), I have two ideas.

*"Cursed" tools*. Probably, the dungeon can generate artifacts or, in this case, tools. For example, farming equipment that haunts the dreams of its wielder with a simple farming manuals. Even with rudimentary communication abilities, these creatures will eventually be able to replicate such items and take advantage of new knowledge transmitted through visions.

*Reward-based learning*. Let's assume that the dungeon can create puzzle-protected treasures. In order to advance its inhabitants, dungeon should make simple puzzles that gradually increase in difficulty and require cooperation abilities. If this solution works, the creatures will slowly develop simple forms of communication. Maybe puzzle-protected treasure caches will even become sacred places for them.

** How can I justify a humanoid race with blue skin? What kind of evolutionary advantage would it confer?

I was thinking "chlorophyll, except magic", but I'd prefer an explanation that isn't complete bullshit.

*** In humans, purplish-blue skin is a condition that results from metal poisoning in the body (most commonly silver). Maybe silver is the best metal to channel magic or they live in an extremely radioactive environment which would make it an advantage instead. Since some types of radiation are easily blocked by a few millimeters to centimeters of metal (don't know which types, so you'll have to research that part), the extra metals in or near the skin could help prevent radiation damage.

*** Although the reason why chlorophyll is green is slightly bullshit.

The first organisms that evolved to gather energy from sunlight were purple-coloured, absorbing green light for energy (retinal). Once cyanobacteria evolved chlorophyll, the most abundant unused light spectrum was not-green. Chlorophyll was more efficient, and thus outcompeted the purple organisms, which is the reason why all plants are green today (they reflect green light).

(This is only one theory about why plants are green, but it makes sense looking at evolutionary timing, etc.)

*** It could be evolutionary adaptation. If the average flora color in a certain region were blue, it could be a region trait. As for why people were still blue, it could be social pressures - having different vibrancies of blue could be a mark of lineage/class and whatnot.

** So, I'm giving my vampires titles and a social hierachy. But I don't know about the names for the different levels. I didn't want to go like King / Prince / Duke / Lord or whatever, since vampire society is ancient and multicultural so it's kind of weird to use them. Plus, I found a really cool word ("janissary") that was used for a certain type of slave-turned-bodyguard in Turkey that seemed pretty applicable to a concept of a vampire hanger-on, so I'm interested in finding more such "international" words.

Here's what I have so far. I've used English words to go for the sort of concept I'm going for. It's hard, because while I want to incorporate multiple cultures, I also want them to read cleanly and be easily pronounced in the English language.

Does anyone have suggestions for terms that

*Vampire “Royal” titles:* (titles listed between slashes are ones I haven't chosen between yet)

- Samraat / Sovereign / Archon: Potential title for “the king of all vampires”; does not really exist, though some greedy vampires with no decorum might be pretenders to this title. As globalisation spreads, some vampires want to use this for a person who will head the no doubt imminent global convocations of several “Pharaohs”. Usage: Would just be a simple title: “Samraat Bethany”
- Pharoah / Anax / Ard Ri: “High King”: Someone who rules over several Crowns. Usually used at a convocation (happens about once a century) where a Crown is selected to temporarily act as the chairperson-equivalent. This title usually lasts for a few years as negotiations about territory boundaries, policies for dealing with humans, ways to enforce the masquerade are discussed. Usage: Would be a simple title: “Pharoah Elizabeth of Terra Australis”
- Crown: Highest title commonly in use. This vampire has a large swath of territory and is subordinate to nobody. They are all officially considered equal, but in reality there are more and less prestigious lands to hold and vampires will sometimes obliquely mock one another for this. A weak Crown may have her territory subsumed under a neighboring Crown's and be demoted. A strong “Duke” may secede. Crowns “rule” over several “Dukes”. Usage: Have the title of Lord, e.g. “Lord William of New Holland”
- “Dukes” (real name: Dey / Oba / Pasha / Baron / Duke): Control and maintain a small area. They have to look after their Shudra and ensure they are behaving appropriately. They must ensure that no new Shudra are created without the Crown's blessing. Usage: Have a title, e.g. “Duke Karnya of the Kimberley”
- Shudra: Vampires who live in areas controlled by “Dukes”. They will have their lands assigned to them and moved around at the Duke's pleasure. Usually young, weak or disgraced. Usage: No title; maybe “Red of the Swan River” (using name of their Duke's land) if needed to distinguish them from others, or potentially even “Red of Lord William of New Holland”

My concerns:

- I really like the word Oba, which is a Yoruba/Bini (Africa) word for a special type of king who controls a single city - which is the exact connotation I was going for. The problem is, it's a word that's still in use today and is used for a sort of religious leader, so I don't think it's appropriate to use in my novel about gay vampires.

- I'm using the word Shudra from the Indian caste system and again wonder if it's an inappropriate choice.

- The position Crown corresponds to the title of Lord. This is kind of weird isn't it?

*** Is this setting on Earth? If so, you should probably use regionally appropriate ranking systems, and make not of what is equivalent when necessary. If not, a hybrid of different earth terms seems kind of weird, compared to either sticking to one scheme or inventing your own (Drashu -> Kude -> Helm -> Ropha ->Ratsaam).

Not really, it doesn't really work with what you're going for.. Something Chevalier like from blood+ could work, or a knight in any other name.

I would recommend that all the titles should correspond with each other in some way - say depending on the place of origin of vampirism. India - then Samraat, Egypt - then Pharaoh and so on..

**** Thanks for the comment!

Unfortunately, vampires originated A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far, Far Away, so there's no "one" culture they're from.

I think I might do what another commenter did and just have people use the titles from their "native" languages, so you'd have a bunch of people of equal rank but with completely different titles. I like the idea of a term used by, say, a particular individual sticking and being in vogue though.

But really it doesn't add much to the universe and can be hard for readers to keep track of. I might do the old standby of seeing if I can find titles of ancient Roman nobility and change them slightly in the vowels (you know... instead of a Duke you're a Duki...) and see how that looks.
