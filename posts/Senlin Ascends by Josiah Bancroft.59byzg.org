This is a recent self-published fantasy-ish novel that has been getting a lot of good reviews lately and a very high goodreads score. ([[https://www.amazon.com/Senlin-Ascends-Books-Babel-1/dp/1482590956][Amazon]])

Tower of Babel is an immense structure as wide as a small city and so high, nobody has seen its summit. It houses countless strange and wonderful societies and kingdoms within. Our main character, Tomas Senlin wanted to spend the honeymoon with his wife Marya exploring the Tower, when Marya went missing. Now Tomas must go on a quest to find her. This is no easy task, not only because the Tower is huge, but also because to his shock it turns out to be a veritable hive of scum and villainy. A humble schoolteacher, Senlin quickly becomes entangled in webs of intrigue and has to rely on his wits and book-smarts alone not to become the victim of the large number of powerful crooks who would very much like to take advantage of him.

The book is the first of the planned 4 book series. It reaches a fairly solid conclusion (but doesn't reach it's ultimate goal, as you might have suspected). It's described as fantasy, although it doesn't seem to feature any magic so far. The society is comparable to late 19th century Europe with some steampunk elements and a lot of additional weirdness. Reviewers often praise its prose. The characters are likable and quirky, the societies and the setting are creative and by the end all the little details and plot elements add up to a pretty satisfying resolution. The world is pretty dark and gritty - the Tower is not a nice place to be in - but the general tone of the story is optimistic and hopeful. It a little like Jules Verne but more fantastical and with modern sensibilities, or Kafka but less gloomy and more swashbuckly. I recommend it as an a fun, enjoyable book that isn't quite like anything else I've read.

*But is it rational?* Moderately so. It probably satisfies the criteria of rational fiction. Learned and logical Senlin would definitely consider himself a rational person. He always tries to have a well-thought out plan and has to rely on his intelligence to get what he wants. If you pay attention to hints, you can figure out one of the small revelations about the nature of the tower relatively easily. Occasionally characters do not-so-smart things and some plans end up working because the author wants them to. That didn't harm my enjoyment of the story, but it brings it a bit down rationality-wise.


** Nice recommendation, I'm currently up to the Commissioner art arc and its been fun so far.
