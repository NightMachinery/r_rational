*** Ah, you're right, the flowing fist the girl uses at the end to block the opponents' shot and then send it back to them! I think that was inspired by tai chi? Anyway it probably lingered somewhere in my mind and affected the way I wrote that scene, the concept of dissipating the kinetic energy of the projectile by partially going along with it is very much the same.

** Slowest update yet I think. I'm really quite out of it these days. Out of curiosity, do you have any specific techniques/ways to get into the writing mindset? I enjoy it when I manage it and it's actually a great way for me to take my mind off anything that's stressing me out at a given time - it's just that if I am stressed out, or worried, or tired, it's very hard for me to ever get to that point, and often end up focusing on more relaxing and brainless activities (like gaming). I assume I'm not alone in that, but it's frustrating nonetheless. I've tried just putting myself in front of the page and forcing myself to start writing, but it usually only ends up stressing myself more, and not producing anything. Perhaps it works best if I leave the work at a point where the continuation is really obvious - like midway through an action scene - so that when I pick it back up I have an easy hook, but it doesn't come natural to do that because of course when I am in flow I just want to see what I'm doing wrapped up well.

*** You could try using a randomized writing system. Say the situation is such that after the Red ribbon chapters, Goku is sparring with Yamcha, and they're supposed to both be talking about Bulma... but there's writing block on how the conversation is supposed to go.

You set up some emotions on a die, and then set up a separate success/failure die for each. I rolled using my system, and I got: Goku: Happy, successful Yamcha: Flat, successful

So the conversation goes well in general, but Goku will come off as happier. Maybe Yamcha is still regretting he's not dating Bulma, not enough to cause him harm, but enough for him to chat with Goku about it. Goku focuses on how much help Bulma has been providing in training, and Yamcha shrugs and feels he probably has a point.

Running that exact same system with a different set of rolls: Goku: Berserk, successful Yamcha: Curious, successful

It's a full moon, and Goku is pissed that Bulma is still prying about his Giant Ape transformation, since she said she wouldn't and he only got control over it once. Yamcha is curious to see how it goes, since he hadn't promised that. Goku sighs, goes outside, transforms, and then proceeds to resume sparring with Yamcha in Giant ape form, forcing Yamcha to go far more heavy on dodging as he watches Goku's moves.

One more time: Goku: Sad, failure Yamcha: Curious, successful

Yamcha is surprised to beat Goku in a sparring match, since he'd expect it to be the other way around. Apparently, Goku is miserable after finding out from Bulma processing reports from her Mark 2 system that he killed 440 people while fighting Red Ribbon. It's a very large number, easily more than some entire villages he went through early in his journey. Yamcha can't console him himself, but he thinks Bulma may know, so goes to get her.

Anyhow, not that any one of those 3 is the right direction to go in particular, but it definitely can help you to push past a blank page.

**** Hmm, that's a cool idea when looking for directions to push the story into - btw I even have story dice I could use for that - but what I am thinking about is more just actually mustering the mental strength to stay focused and start writing words at all. I usually know well enough what must happen, but if I'm in bad condition my brain will just go dum-dum and I will even have a hard time finding the right words (this usually following a day of intellectual work on either coding, paper writing, physics theory, or the worst option of all - office politics and project management).

***** For that, I generally use my wife pushing me into writing. She frequently really wants to find out what happens next, I want house cleaning, kisses, dinner, or some errand. We do a lot of trading. Recently I was miserable and said I wanted 3 things to resolve some minor point about a missing arm of a just found doll of a Canal Control system, because it was ALREADY going to be repaired later and so surely the specifics of the one doll arm didn't matter.

But she apparently really wanted to know, because she did all 3 things just for me to write a scene about the group, exhausted and grumpy ( I was channeling my own emotions) tracking down little clues until they found the one remaining doll arm to make repairs cheaper.

I don't know if ‘Marry someone who likes your writing' is generalizable advice, but it really does boost writing output for me.

****** Ouch, that's not really doable for me either.

I've got a girlfriend, we live together and we both write, but our styles and tastes couldn't be any more different. She probably hasn't read a sci-fi or fantasy novel once in her life, it'd likely bore her out of her mind, and she in fact just doesn't like reading in English as she finds it tiring. She's often surprised that I can write in it as my main language at all, despite not being mothertongue myself. She's read some of my original stories, but concerning this or other fanfictions, she's often not nearly familiar enough with the setting to be interested or able to appreciate them either. Conversely, I do read sometimes what she writes, but it's not much my cup of tea. Very non-rational, in fact - often mood driven rather than plot or character, sort of stream of consciousness stuff with a strong magical realism bent. Very descriptive and with rather purple prose. I give her my best opinions but I've sometimes told her perhaps she'd be better off finding someone else to have them read her work because I realise I don't exactly give off an aura of enthusiasm when talking about it, but I can't help it. I don't think she's bad, in fact I think she should be more confident and spread it around more, get some good feedback from people who DO appreciate the genre - it's just that I very much don't.

Good for you that you can, though! That sounds fun.

*** I remember a writing parable.

A writer was going to write a novel. They decided that they would just write the "exciting" parts first and then go back and do all the "boring" parts afterwards. After writing all the exciting parts, the writer looked over their work, and decided to publish the novel as it was.

I believe the moral is: if even you the writer find a particular part boring, then why are you even including it in the story? Either it's necessary, in which case there must be a way of making it interesting, or it's not necessary, in which case why even include it?

You're writing ratfic; you can assume some intelligence on the part of your audience. Just tell us a certain thing happened, let those of us who care about some particular detail speculate, and then you can come back later and either confirm the speculation you find most interesting or use what we come up with as a starting point and go back over that part in a flashback later.

**** I mean, the chapters I'm writing right now are slower for me because they require a lot of thinking about who's where, multiple parallel events, and often that means I need to focus a lot on things happening and people talking rather than getting to fly a bit higher and more free in terms of prose or concepts. That said, I can't really say "ok, let's just jump to when [...]" as it would just make no sense. I think the example of that parable works only depending on what your novel is aiming to be. Any plot-driven story needs some sort of connective tissue to keep it together - not to mention, a story can't be on overdrive 100% of the time or it would get exhausting, readers need some breathing time, you have climaxes and then lulls to recover from them and set the board for what happens next.

Perhaps part of this is also the problem with writing a fanfic and posting it live. If you find out that maybe after all you could have pushed the story in a different direction for maximum writing enjoyment... it's too late.

Hmm, I see your point. I guess maybe that could be applicable for some things, but if I went too far with it, there just would be no story at all. I already don't spend whole chapters simply describing people training or doing research (see what I did with Chapter 27, where that had been what I had originally in mind), but right now I don't feel like I can skip too much material without making the story feel disjointed.

***** To be fair, you're already jumping around by going back and forth between the past and present. Might as well embrace it. Being disjointed isn't always a bad thing for a story either. Just look at [[https://bit.ly/2vGPSFW][Memento]] and [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boogiepop_Phantom][Boogipop Phantom]].

****** I know I'm doing that a lot, but I don't want to go overboard with it. To avoid confusing both the readers and myself.

To be fair, I think that style of writing would be much easier to handle if I was writing a novel to be published in one go. Then I could go back and forth, fix things if I realise they don't work with what happens later, and so on. In that perspective, non-linear narration becomes only a matter of reshuffling a story that you have all the time to plan in a very traditional, linear fashion. The same does not hold here - of course I have a decent plan of the whole story, but the devil's in the details sometimes, and once a chapter is out, it's set in stone for my purposes.

(says this right before writing Chapter 32, which again will feature /massive/ flashbacks...)

******* I can see how writing serially as opposed to block publication would be harder since you're stuck with whatever you've already shown the audience. In the /So You Want to Be a Wizard/ series, the author had been writing the series for literal decades and some technological advances made certain things obsolete, so in the most recent book she invoked an Author Fiat™ and proclaimed that the series now takes place in 2011, so she doesn't have to worry about tech creep anymore.

It's okay to say, "Hey I've thought of a better way of doing this but my previous posts have me stuck in a corner, so I'm retconning this that and the other thing. Sorry for any inconvenience, and I'll try not to make a habit of doing this". If you're upfront about it, I'm sure most of us readers would be understanding.

*** What works for me sometimes is skipping ahead to a part of the story/chapter that I'm excited about or can easily visualize. Even if all I'm doing is setting a scene, or writing stilted, basic dialogue, or even "outlining" each upcoming plot point, it's still progress that can help jostle things free and make it easier to write more when the mood hits.

**** I've considered it, but I'm also worried about running out of cool parts earlier and then be left only with the more boring stuff to fill in the gaps. I suppose I could just write rough drafts of single scenes that I'll define later.

** Thanks for the new chapter, I continue to enjoy this story a lot :) I don't know if this is in the cards, but one thing I'm really looking forward to is Bulma augmenting herself to become a powerful fighter akin to the +androids+ cyborgs. No reason to let Dr. Gero have all the augmenting-human-fun, especially since Bulma is so much more ambitious and focused on the bigger picture in this story.
