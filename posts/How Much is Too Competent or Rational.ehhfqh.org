** In addition to what others have written I think you're working under a different definition of rational than me. For me there is no clash between rational and emotions, a completely rational character would still feel a full array of emotions. Acting on your emotions can also be rational insofar that your current emotions are a calibrated reaction to reality. Rational people are bounded by lack of knowledge, lack of resources, lack of time, and lack of brain processing power, and so it's completely fine for me that they in many situation takes a decision that ends up being suboptimal.

** I was going to say: No, just strengthen the challenge to match the stronger character.

Then I read a wise comment, and afterwards was going to say: Depict their cognitive power level consistently. There's no punch too strong for a superhero, but the author should know how many Newtons they can exert.

Then I read another comment, and remembered Vinge's Law. If characters are getting "bogged down in thought" or seem "too logical" (lol) in an inorganic way, it means you're overrunning by too far the level of good reasoning that you can fluidly use yourself and explain to others. So that's how much intelligence is too much.

*** thank you for the advice. But, in your opinion, how would you distinguish being logical in an organic way, compared to being logical in a way that doesn't feel natural? My main gripe when writing, is to make a protagonist that's rational, without making it so that the protagonist is always right.

*** Re: Vinge's Law:

Is there such a thing as a rational story you can't tell /yet/ (for lack of your own reasoning abilities), but where you /can/ “put away” the story (by e.g. writing down a plot outline), and then come back to it to successfully write it years later?

I know this works for non-rational fiction writing, where the block is either that you haven't built your Creative Writing abilities enough; or that you're trying to write in someone else's setting, and you don't understand said setting well-enough yet.

But does it work for rational-fic?

It seems to me that in ratfic, the story beats you can follow are necessarily constrained by what intelligent characters should be doing (or rather, by what errors they would avoid making.) You can't have a beat in a ratfic that requires someone to be holding an idiot ball. And seemingly, in ratfic, these idiot balls are still idiot balls /even if you don't recognize them as such at the time/.

So, is there any point to trying to outline a ratfic you don't think you can write yet? Or will the outline inevitably be trash when you come back to it with enough understanding to write it?

**** As Yudkowski notes in his [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/thoughtful-responses][Thoughtful Responses]] post, rational characters don't want the drama and conflict that your plot would entail. The hero and the villain both want to use whatever resources they have to end the conflict before it even starts, or at least well before the end of chapter 1 if possible. They're good at solving problems, and your entire plot /is/ a problem, so your challenge as a rationalist author is basically to come up with circumstances and logical reasons for why the conflict can't be quickly or easily solved while keeping both characters consistently acting with a reasonable degree of intelligence and forethought.

As long as the main story arc cannot be easily resolved from the beginning by either character, you should be able to flesh out an outline for your story and then revise the details while you continue to learn relevant information and writing techniques. It's likely that you'll need to change some of your details, but that shouldn't derail the story as long as you have a solid understanding of why your antagonist/protagonist have no good choices other than conflict, and (at least initially) no quick way to resolve that conflict.

That doesn't sound right to me. Why does the story not being resolvable /from the beginning/, imply that the story doesn't have the possibility of being resolved after the first or second chapter instead, thus meaning that working up any part of the story after /that/ chapter will have been a waste?

That's more what I'm worried about. I'm not worried that I'll write some characters that, if they were smarter, wouldn't even fight. Instead, I'm worried that I might write a plot that, three chapters in, introduces (and heavily depends upon!) a magic-system with an inherent "game-breaking flaw" that I don't notice at the time. I'd put in all the effort to write the whole rest of the story, leaning on that flawed magic system. And then, half-way through polishing, I'd notice the flaw, determine that there's no way that my protagonist /wouldn't/ spot the flaw, and then ...give up, I guess, since the story would now end right there in chapter three.

Find a way to edit the flaw out or obscure it with imperfect information or make it too costly to use, then revise the rest of the story to be in line with your edit. There's always a way to do it, you just have to see it. Often the best part of the story arises from the burst of inspiration and complexity that comes when you find the path forward, the clever and natural seeming fix.

And there's always going to be something you miss, something that slips by.

Remember, the characters don't /want/ the narrative to occur. The good guys don't want to go through hardship and win by rolling the dice on impossible odds. The villains don't want to beat the heroes at every turn, then lose because of something they never saw coming. Both sides want to /win/ - and moreover, they want to win /as quickly as possible/.

​

Doing what is best for the /narrative/ is having the Rebellion try an impossible assault against the Death Star in snub fighters and win. Letting the /characters be smart/ (even the villains!) would be having the Death Star jump in, allowing the snub fighters to approach, then jumping in a few Star Destroyers to glass the surface of Yavin IV.

****** My point is that it's the author's job to craft the setting and events of the story such that smart people would make decisions that result in a compelling narrative. One side curb-stomping the other does not make for compelling reading, but neither does one side making stupid decisions and the other side winning because of that.

I don't want to read a story about the good guys winning because the bad guys are stupid, incompetent, or both. I don't even necessarily want to read a story about good guys and bad guys. The best books - the most compelling stories - are about smart people making good decisions in the service of what they believe to be right coming into conflict with /other smart people making good decisions in the service of what/ they /believe to be right/, with both sides being morally justifiable to the audience.

But even if you have clear good versus clear bad, no one, including the villain, should /make bad decisions/. Sub-optimal decisions? Good decisions based on incomplete or faulty information? These are reasonable mistakes and ones which can make stories much more interesting. But I cannot stand when characters make /stupid/ decisions.

This is part of why I love Timothy Zahn's original Thrawn trilogy (/Heir to the Empire/, /Dark Force Rising/, and /The Last Command/) so much. Until his final defeat, the only times the bad guy (who demonstrates that he is a /very/ smart man) loses are not because he does stupid things. Most of the time, in fact, he makes /better decisions than the good guys/, and thus wins! But when he does lose, it is almost always a fluke; it is due to something that he could not know and could not reasonably have surmised. /This is what makes the story compelling/. The villain is /smart/; in many cases, /smarter/ than the good guys! He is not handed the Idiot Ball for the sake of advancing the plot.

That's really my definition of 'smart', though I suppose that I should add that smart characters generally know what they want as well. Characters need not be rationalists to be smart. Tywin Lannister was smart (/mostly/ - he did have a couple of blind spots, largely regarding his children). Cersei Lannister was not.

********* Ok, it looks like we basically agree.

Your way of thinking about it just isn't very good to me though. I feel like you don't often post on r/r?

Let's see. We do have smart ~ characters on path to getting what they want, and the author doesn't want them to get it easily.

I suppose this suggests a way of writing characters smarter than yourself - do research, or write as a team.

The problem, and I'm going to say it is a problem, with your view is that it treats stories as optimisation problems with definite answers.

That just isn't the case for stories.

We /want/ a lot of variation in stories, because variance is how you learn.

So if you want to write a story that's "like an optimisation problem" (and the consequence of your view is that you do want that) then you /are/ writing rational fiction, possibly rationalist, whether you want to call it that or not.

** Personally, rational fiction isn't about characters who are calculators and always preform the logically correct action with emotionless, mechanical, ease. *Rational fiction is about authors/storytellers not using character stupidity as a crutch for bad storytelling.*

Too often in fiction, characters make stupid/irrational decisions, not because /that's what the character would actually do/ but rather because the author needs them to do so in order to advance their plot. This is what rational fiction is about--and IMO where the genre came from. Readers and writers were frustrated with fictional characters who make stupid decisions for plot reasons, not for character reasons. This is especially prevalent when characters are introduced in highly skilled professions (doctors, scientists, marines, experts) but then make elementary mistakes or overlook the blindingly obvious. Having a stupid character in a rational fiction is perfectly fine, as making bad decisions would be part of their character.

I would say that a lot of people here are trying to write things that are both rational fiction and “competence porn”, though: things where the /setting/ and /antagonists/ are rational, but where the /protagonist/ always makes optimal choices, not because that's realistic, but because that's a kind of power fantasy (and also, kind of soothing for people who are socially anxious: “competence porn” stories are a guarantee that the story will contain 0% secondhand-embarrassment.)

** I suppose the short answer is "when it would negatively affect the plot." Rational characters are supposed to intelligently use their resources to accomplish their goals. Stories are about struggle, conflict, suffering, things that rational characters want to avoid. Sure, you don't want a story that involves a bunch of conflict that was easily avoidable, something that anyone could or should have thought to prepare against, but you also want your story to be more than a page of "so yeah he thought of this ahead of time and none of it was a challenge and happily ever after. The end."

As seen in the recent chapters of Worth the Candle, sometimes the thought process of being rational would interfere with the pacing of the story, or there would be far too much thought happening in a far too short amount of time. At this point in the story, Juniper has a lot of options to do lots of things, and a lot of time and resources to prepare a lot of different things. But, as the author pointed out, when faced with some challenge that the author already decided will work for whatever reason, it would be super boring and kill the pacing for Juniper to go through a huge list of the things he might be able to do and giving reasons why that probably wouldn't work just to satisfy the commenters that he did the "optimal" thing. When time is short, you can't have someone giving paragraphs of thought in 4 seconds, because people just don't think that fast.

If you try too hard to show that your character is doing things rationally, it can come across as masterbatory. Just a bunch of long winded "look at all the clever things that I can come up with" that is maybe occasionally enjoyable for other people to read but isn't generally considered good writing.

There's of course the very common case where you don't want you character to be particularly rational, for lots of sensible reasons. Being extremely emotional is usually a detriment to using your intelligence to solve problems, but if you go too far the character comes off as an emotionless robot. Sometimes people do get seriously emotionally affected by circumstances, combat being a good example. Sometimes people have strong aversions to things that the reader knows would actually help them, or conversely not having strong aversions seems odd, as in the case of Zorian dying very casually. Sometimes you just don't want your character to be a paragon of rationality in the first place. Most of the time really.

So basically, yes, there's lots of reasons to make character less than perfectly rational. This subreddit focuses on stories that showcase certain themes and tropes that we enjoy, but it shouldn't do so at the cost of writing a good story.

*** I want to note that I feel like altering the strength of the character or the difficulty of the challenge to suit the needs of storytelling feels backwards to me, as a rational author.

Like, it feels like a violation of the genre to tinker with the settings mid-stream just because it makes the story flow better.

From my perspective, the right way to write in this genre is to lock in your settings, and then see what naturally emerges, with the tinkering being mostly /choosing from among possible options/ the one that makes for the best story.

It may be that you were talking more about "which things do we show, and which do we skip over?" But I wanted to note the objection to *a* claim, even if it's not the claim *you* were making.

**** I'm not sure which line in particular you're referring to. If you're talking about choosing a story somewhere between easily avoidable conflict and easily solved conflict, yes you would ideally set the story up so that you don't have to change the characters or the setting half way through. Hopefully you have enough wiggle room for both so that you can tell a compelling story even if you slightly misjudged one aspect of your story at the beginning.

If you're responding to "a challenge that the author has already decided will work for whatever reason", I include "the antagonists have resources and information that the protagonist doesn't know about and has no current way to completely counter" as one of those reasons. It doesn't need to be railroading, where the author decided the plot beats ahead of time and is altering the characters and setting to create those, it could be for anything.

** IMO, the sweet spot to aim for when you want to show off rationality (as opposed to when you want to show your character not yet knowing how to be rational in a given context) is "the character is as rational, /before/ learning the lesson the hard way, as you would be immediately /after/ learning the lesson the hard way."

Otherwise, they should remain entirely human, including in their emotional reactions, hotheadedness, inability to cope, etc. etc. They're "too rational" if they're e.g. 25 years old, and react to a situation as coolly as a 55-year-old battle hardened grandmother who's seen it all before would.

But if they, like, see the problem a split second /before/ it's too late, instead of a split second /after,/ like a normal person, this is exciting and inspiring and gives people something like a roadmap to learn from.

** I think the answer always depends on the character. I believe that a not-too-smart character can still be considered rational if their behaviour is portrayed consistently, and conversely a "smart" a character can and should have blind spots in their reasoning from time to time, be they caused by a personal failure or things like time pressure or stress.

Whichever way the author chooses to take the character is up to them, but once a character trait is established, it can't change on a whim to suit the story.

On the other hand, all rules are made to be broken, so if the author can get away with some handwavy stuff to make a better story, it might be the rational choice.

** I don' think the problem you are presenting is tied to rationality, it's just a universal problem where you expect characters to behave consistently with human nature plus how they were presented in the story so far. In fact, one of the main goals of rational writing is just that.

Too much competency is a different problem and of course it can be a bad thing (Mary Sue) but it doesn't mean it can't work (One punch man). Again, this is just about good writing.

But one trap that was already mentioned in another comment that seems to happen in rational fiction is that characters end up analyzing situations for apparent minutes (and it takes minutes to read that analysis) while only a second has actually passed. How bad (or good) this is, is unclear. A different approach would be to do the analysis before the scene in a form of preparation, or do it afterward as a retrospection of instinctual thought processes that happened at the time. That would be more realistic I guess.

** I was trying to write rational fiction in a Lovecraft/Eternal Darkness style setting, because that was recently mentioned as an interesting challenge. and actually I noticed that the thing that contributed heavily to the viewpoint character's feeling less competent was when she had less time to think. She'd encounter some weird thing, and if she had time to think about it, she generally seemed to do quite well.

But if things just kept rushing along, with her phone turning on, followed by the contact being weird, followed by detention and then a flicker in the mirror, followed by seeing a picture of a tentacle monster, followed by being yelled at by an unidentifiable security guard, who shoved her into a library that inexplicably locked behind her after the guard left, she felt less powerful, and more scared.

By contrast, when Harry pulled off his best moves in HPMOR, he had an entire group of people doing his thinking at enhanced speed.

Or during a fight in Optimized Wish Project, during a fight against a high level opponent, Goku was explicitly called out on spending too much time thinking about a smart move mid fight, allowing the opponent to steal initiative, whereas against slower opponents, Goku could practically play the fight in his head, spotting and moving to blind spots and having prepped counter moves.

So after considering that, I suppose a character might come off as too competent/rational if circumstances seem to be such that they're never out thought, never rushed, and no one ever tries to blow up their computer servers or steal their intelligence artifact?

** With Zorian I think it kinda makes sense because he's been in a time loop so long, he's grown desensitised to all of it, including the death and violence. In fact it was an explicit worry of his, that he might be /too/ desensitised once he leaves it. That said, yes, MoL certainly isn't big on the "exploring emotional states" side, it focuses more on just expanding the world building, the magic system, and munchkining the two. I think it's fine and can be fun if that's what you want to write too.

In general, sure, characters can and should act irrationally or make bad decisions from time to time. That actually also gives you some wiggle room in writing the story: there may be times when such a bad decision is better for you to keep the story interesting, and at the same time plausible for the character the way they've been defined. The key thing is, if a character's trait is that for example they're too proud, they could make a mistake out of excessive pride, but a mistake out of excessive humility would seem straight up forced. And if they make too many mistakes, realistic or not, they'll just grow unlikable, and like they simply deserve whatever shit outcome they get.

** Funny you use /Mother of Learning/ as an example, because that is one of the few examples I go to for a perfectly done (by m standards) rational character.

Conceptually, yes, anything can be overdone. In practice...that's not really the major where rationalist writers go wrong. A much more common problem is inconsistency. Authors who lovingly Munchkin things in one part and then have the hero behave in a ridiculously moronic way elsewhere. The Munchkining Murder Hobo for instance. Or Lyra in the Golden Compass TV series...who is waaaay too smart for a child in places and an idiot elsewhere.

Actually, making kids too smart is a common problem that is close to what you describe. Also blunting the impact of your drama by having characters not angsty enough...I find that is a problem in Portal Fantasy. Really, characters should be a nervous wreck after inexplicably being sent to another world.

Personally, I like characters who have a quiet internal breakdown and then when push comes to shove make reasonable decisions.
