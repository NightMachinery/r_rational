The second book in the Age of Fire series by E.E. Knight, titled Dragon Avenger is my favorite book in an awesome series, simply because it takes a normal Dragoness, and by having her adopted by a short-lived, but amazingly humanistic character, sets her on a life path of scholarship and diplomacy, where being a huge dragon is actually a disadvantage.

And when I encounter a story like that, I'm forever after looking for stories and thinking up my own plot bunnies to match or surpass it. For example, what goals would a mid-range rational Smaug have? If instead of simply pointlessly razing Erebor, could he have gained an ally stronger than himself?

And to generalize the question, the same idea could be put to most Kaiju, from the classic Godzilla and Mothra all the way up to modern-day evil space whales.

** Well, now I can't stop thinking of an alternate Pacific Rim timeline where Newton and Hermann adopted the baby Kaiju with which they mind melded. And then educated it in their respective fields as it grew and fought alongside Jaegers against its enslaved "family".

I hope you're happy.

*** If you take the next step and actually write it, I would be more than happy, I'd proofread, edit, and plug it to all the text loving forums, because that story deserves to be read.

** I think I'd have difficulty writing a story from the POV of a kaiju. I don't know what that says about me. I am playing around with a rational story involving a giant monster, but not from the monster's POV. I must give this more thought. Thanks for posting, [[/u/Prezombie]]!

*** For all its faults, the chapters in /Eragon/ which were written from Saphira's perspective were pretty neat about portaying a dragon. There's probably other books that do it better, but I don't know of them.

** [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealing_with_Dragons][Dealing with Dragons]] kind of fits, although it is more genre-breaking than rational. I read it a few years ago and remember the main character being clever and pragmatic.

** Well, I'm a sucker for ginormous scaly monstrosities delicately turning pages with their various clawed appendages.. I'll give it a read :P

You just reminded me of an old Choose-Your-Adventure text game I played a while back - [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/dragon/][Choice of Dragons]].

Now not rational per se, but there are paths where you can eschew with the pyromania and do some diplomacy and fairly one sided negotiations. You still stay true to your rabid kleptomania for hoard and penchant for casual subject devouring though.

I had this fanfic idea after I first played it where the dragon hoarded books instead of loot, and actually ruling - developing the initial dynamic between queen and the courtiers, doing things like integrating his faithful goblins within the society, generally thinking of ways you could use him to revolutionize the kingdom.
