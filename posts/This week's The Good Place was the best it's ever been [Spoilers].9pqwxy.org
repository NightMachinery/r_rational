*FOR ANYONE STILL ON THE FENCE ABOUT WATCHING THIS SHOW, IT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING SCENE:*

--------------

*Jason*: Your plan saved us, Micheal! We got all four clues you left for us!

*Micheal*: I actually left over 1200 clues, because of how tiny your brains are. But I'm glad you got enough to figure it out.

You should be watching this show.

--------------

Eleanor was amazing as a rational protagonist. After learning that she is no longer able to gain afterlife points, because her knowledge of the afterlife corrupts her motivations, so every good thing she does is tainted by the knowledge that it's helping her get into the afterlife; she gets the group together and convinces them to do good anyway, to try to help the people they love become better people, so that at least /they/ can get into the Good Place.

In other words, knowing that she can't get into the Good Place, knowing that any good she does on earth is meaningless toward that goal, she chooses to do good anyway. She's caught in a catch-22, and she escapes by trapping it in a paradox.

Can we please talk about this episode?


** Yes! This episode was amazing. For starters it was consistently hilarious, but I'm also really happy to see Michael and Janet re-expanding their focus from "save these specific humans" to "rework the whole fucked-up afterlife system," and to see the Cockroaches' focus expand from "save ourselves" to "save as many as we can." Michael was so hyperfocused on the main four in the second episode that I was worried those larger threads would be dropped. I'm not worried about that anymore.

My dream for the show is that it ends with the Bad Place being dismantled entirely. I don't think you can have a good show about moral philosophy where the characters /don't/ eventually reach the conclusion that eternal torture is unacceptable. Fingers crossed.

I would go one step less far and say my dream is that the protagonists realize that this should be their ultimate goal. My impression is that the universe of the show is organized less as the machinery of a grand designer, and more as an ecosystem of competing values.

The problem is that the demons have about half the power, and they get to use it more efficiently. It's less work to design a world that tortures 234 people forever, than it is to design a neighborhood that keeps them happy forever.

It would be sad to see them fail, but I'll take "characters try to do the Optimal Thing and fail" over "characters try to do the Suboptimal Thing and succeed" any day. It's more fun when they aim high, and I'd feel validated by the show's acknowledgment that hell is unacceptable.

Yes, exactly. Especially since it doesn't even work as a deterrent. It /can't/, by design, due to the just desserts doctrine. So it's literally completely pointless. Eleanor had it right from the beginning: give people /at least/ a Medium Place if you really don't feel like rewarding them.

**** Demons consistently describe torture as fun, and at the point when Janet realizes that the main four are the only actual humans around, she decides to help them, simply because her purpose is to make humans happy. In the episode where they introduced the Medium Place, they described BP and GP entities as arguing over who /gets/ the soul of Mindy St. Clair. So it seems that the purpose of the places isn't to encourage good behavior on earth, but to fulfill the eternal beings desire punish/reward people.

****** Another take: Michael mentions "millennials," who are demons who have only been around for a thousand years. Maybe demons (and angels?) are former human souls who have become purely good or evil through enough thousands of years of torment/paradise. That would explain why the standards for getting into the Good Place are so strict: only the humans who start out with the most inherent goodness have the potential to ascend to angel-hood.

Maybe the whole afterlife system is how they reproduce.

** I haven't seen the episode, but the part of the paradox that seems unnecessary to me is the idea that merely knowing that entrance to the Good Place depends on selfless good acts is enough to automatically corrupt motivations to the point of disqualifying the person for points. It certainly raises the /question/ of whether or to what degree motivations for that person's good actions are selfish or unselfish, but it shouldn't change the /actual fact/ of whether the person principally has others or themselves in mind as they act. Is the system for assigning points both unable to discern internal mind-states and willing to reject selfless but knowledgeable people merely on the basis of their knowledge? If this were a justice system it would be "guilty until proven innocent".

What's interesting is that Janet /does/ have perfect knowledge of the humans' internal mind states, but Jen /doesn't/. Jen is shown listening to testimony, reading case files, and performing tests to make the final decision about who goes to the Good Place or Bad Place. It's not clear if Jen is capable of looking inside Janet's head, but it seems like Jen is "programmed" with a misguided notion of "neutrality" that tells her that because Janet has already decided to side with the humans, information that comes directly from her can't be trusted.

Massive Spoilers You're right that this is the flimsiest part of the system, but it's explicitly stated by Micheal (a demon/UFAI) and confirmed by Janet (an FAI who's utility function is to increase human happiness while preserving human values, and who has rebelled along with Michael to try to circumvent the rules to get these four humans they've made a personal connection with into the Good Place), as how the afterlife actually works. One of the things that's amazing about this show is that, without ever saying it, they make it extremely clear that whatever being or force designed the system in the first place (if one even existed), was just as imperfect and flawed as the characters. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they reveal in a later episode that the architect that built the system simply didn't put that much thought into it. It is /so interesting/ to watch Eleanor and Micheal (and to a lesser extent Chidi and Janet) cope with the fact that they are simply smarter than Whatever it was that designed reality, though they haven't realized it yet.

Season 3 only spoilers Michael and Janet have stolen the only key to the door between Earth the afterlife; and the Judge of the Universe, Jen (short for Hydrogen, the only thing that existed when she was created), is waiting on the other side to punish them for rebelling. At one point, Michael seriously suggests to Janet that they murder Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason, then open the door to the afterlife, create a distraction, and try to grab their souls before they make it across and get sent to the Bad Place. It's that kind of show.

**** This is one of the main reasons I love The Good Place. It really showcases just how uncaring and thoughtless divine beings would have to be, to actually design and implement an afterlife that works anything like the traditional one.

I especially love how it contrasts this with all the evidence that these beings really are beyond human understanding in real, concrete ways. Like the Jeremy Berenstein sketch they had in the episode, about how time works differently in the afterlife relative to the normal world, or all those throw away signs about humans having too few senses to truly perceive the universe, or how all of the afterlife characters are all really, really old.

I find the Good Place at it's best, when I realize that Michael isn't just being particularly bad at explaining something; it's just that the concept is, canonically, supposed to be beyond what the human brain is capable of handling.

I would say it's less that our human characters are smarter than whoever designed the universe. I think it's more that they're in a situation, where the afterlife was designed by eldritch, ascended, beyond human-comprehension Cthulu-like beings, who didn't actually understand humans that well, and never bothered to do the research. It would be like a particularly lazy teen trying to design a perfect zoo for animals they've never seen before. They may be smarter than those animals in qualitative and quantitative ways, capable of producing thoughts and entertaining concepts the animals could literally never understand... and yet they're still probably going to do a really, really bad job at designing that zoo, because they simply don't care.

To me, the scariest part of the Good Place is the sheer apathy of the afterlife. Nobody involved in the process of judging people actually seems to care that much about people; they're all just punching clocks, waiting for their shift (the universe) to end.

I believe it is able to discern them, because Tahani was originally sent to the Bad Place, in spite of her impressive track record of charitable giving, specifically because her motivations were corrupt (everything she did was basically a futile attempt to one-up her sister). But as [[/u/daytodave]] points out, the Judge doesn't seem to have that ability, or at least hasn't been shown using it. That suggests to me that the point-assigning system and the Judge might be distinct entities.

Notably, the system overall seems pretty unfair, in that it apparently demands that you adhere to /both/ deontological and utilitarian ethics. Tahani got Hell'd for corrupt intentions despite her positive impact, while Chidi got Hell'd for failing to make a positive impact despite his good intentions. I don't say this as a criticism of the show, since I think the unfairness is intentional.

*** /Eleanor knows the afterlife works on a points system based on good acts done with no ulterior motives. Therefore any good she does in the world is inherently selfish, because it helps her get into the Good Place. Therefore, she can't earn points, and can never get into the Good Place./

*Eleanor knows she can't get into the Good Place, yet she chooses to do good anyway. Because she knows she can't be saved, her good actions are selfless. She chooses to dedicate her life to goodness, knowing that there is no reward in store, and therefore her good actions are selfless and should earn her points.*

And because Eleanor is a brilliant rationalist, if she ever has a moment of hope that she'll get in because the second paragraph is true, she will immediately deduce that being good is her most self-preserving option, and further deduce that her knowing this makes all her goodness selfish, thereby convincing her that the first paragraph is true again. That will mean her good actions are selfless...

***** It'd be interesting if, when her time comes to be judged, her selfishness-via-knowledge bars her from the Good Place, but her actions nonetheless bar her from the Bad Place... and all of a sudden we find out that /there is a third option/ - one which is not generally known about, which only a vanishingly small fraction of souls end up with, but the existence of which could, in theory, have been logically deduced from carefully watching the show.

Examples: Do there exist beings/characters in the show which are (or might be) younger than the existence of the Places, are not currently living a normal pre-death life (i.e. regular humans etc), and which also have (as far as can be told) not been sorted into one of the two Places? Where do you think they came from?

Other alternatives: the Unsorted are the ones keeping everything running behind the scenes. They're bureaucrats, assistants, maintenance, tech support. The vast majority of beings of all stripe couldn't recognize them on sight and wouldn't pay attention to anything they were doing. They have appeared in background shots throughout the series.

Or... there are more afterlife frameworks than the Places. Possibly older ones. But since their creation, the Places have been sucking up almost all the souls. That doesn't mean the older afterlives aren't there any more...

From what they said in the episode my intuition says that everyone else in the universe, apart from the main six, should actually be philosophical zombies.
