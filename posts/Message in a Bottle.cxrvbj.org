** There's some nice eternally-driven AI moments. If your constructed-from-tanks crew all dies, build another crew. And another one. And another one, until they can actually live and function properly in the local environment. And be smart enough to conceal the evidence of the existence of previous crews, especially when they're the same people as the current crew.

Also: make offsite backups and sites. If your primary site or center of cognition gets killed, start again from elsewhere. As many times as it takes.

** u/Lightwavers:
#+begin_quote
  There are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, and humanity is determined to explore every one. We send probes, probes with the blueprints to reproduce human explorers upon arrival. Uninhabited worlds the galaxy over can be colonized and populated, until after many years they too can join the vast throng of interstellar civilization. But if a probe is very, very lucky, it will land on a populated world instead. Equestria is one such world.

  Even so, it's far from perfect for colonization, not with an environment lethal to human life. But each probe is resourceful and armed with the greatest machine intelligence mankind has devised. If placing a human mind into a newly manufactured human body won't work, it will just have to get a little more creative.
#+end_quote

Contains AI, rational actors, good writing, exploring an alien species, linguistics, ponies, some civilization building, and a whole lot of words. It's a great sci-fi story that I could imagine seeing in a book store if the ponies were replaced with some other type of alien.

This story is *complete*.

*** I read the first three chapters, it looks promising! I like to finish reading before commenting, but at 500k words that might take a few weeks.

** There, finished reading. Three days - might have done it in two, but I had work.

I liked it a lot. It's hard to have a story where much of the plot it driven by AIs much smarter than humans, but I think it was done pretty well. What was first called an "epilogue" turned out to instead be a whole second story. Not quite as good, but still interesting.

** (minor spoilers regarding the true nature of Equestria)

This story is the first time i've read about what a Dharmic singularity could look like. Most scenarios i've seen end either in the Judeo-Christianity of a Big Good Yudkowskian Singleton, or a Greco-Roman patheon of warring trickster Culture Minds.
