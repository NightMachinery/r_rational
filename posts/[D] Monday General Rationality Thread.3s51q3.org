Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I'm having consistent communication problems with my boss, and I can't figure out how to fix it.

Aside from mumbling, not adjusting his volume to match the surroundings, and flat out misspeaking instructions (which I don't think can be easily solved), he also uses pronouns with no antecedents, uses inconsistently incorrect language, and generally expects me to read his mind.

Does anyone have advice for dealing with those last three problems?

*** I've dealt with people like this a fair amount. Is there a difference between written and oral communication? If you can switch some or all of your communication to being written, you might be able to remove some of the misunderstanding between the two of you. This isn't a surefire method, because some people are /worse/ in written communication than in oral communication, but people tend to utilize different modes of thinking when they switch between the two.

Other than asking for clarifications, there's not a lot you can do. Some people just suck at communicating and don't want to change that, even if they know it's a problem. I've worked with a number of people where that was the case.

**** It's 100% spoken, and that can't be changed. Thanks for the idea though, it may be useful in the future.

Asking for clarification has been my strategy so far, I was hoping for something better. I guess some problems simply don't have good solutions. Such is life.

*** I used a written log of tasks and activities when I faced such problems. Usually I sent a summary of my tasks after talking with my boss via email and asked for corrections if I had misunderstood something. If communication via email is not possible you could do the same on paper, just have a more detailed written plan and ask for your boss' input. Keeping these dated and archived can also be used as evidence later if you're accused of something.

*** The last three problems sound like they have the same root cause: Very poor [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/03/what-developmental-milestones-are-you-missing/][theory of mind]]--he expects you to expect pennies in the skittles bag; he expects you to have been following along with his train of thought since before he actually began speaking.

I'm lucky enough to have only a co-worker who communicates like this, not a boss, so I feel comfortable interrupting him to say "back up a minute; who are we talking about, here?" or "can you show me the email chain that started this?"

If it's the kind of boss who responds poorly to such clarification attempts, your best bet might be intense and constant reconnaissance to determine his current priorities, so you actually do know what he'll be talking about before he says anything. Or, y'know, seeking another position, with someone who's mastered basic communication.

** Currently reading Immortal Cell by Dr. Michael West (non-fiction). One of the most elegantly simple books I've seen written for non-biologists. Aging seems to have evolved when non-specialized germ line cells started dividing into specialized somatic cells to form useful organs to be exploited and discarded. Really mind blowing that all of our suffering and death can traced to this strategy that these replicators stumbled on.

*** I'm not sure this is true, at least so far as I learned in my Biology of Aging course. Even unicellular organisms can age. For assymetrically dividing yeast where you can differentiate between the parent cell and the daughter cell (due to bud scarring), after a certain number of replications the parent cell begins to replicate more slowly. This might be due to accumulated cell damage in the parent cell over time, from things like oxidative damage and other stresses. Repairing that damage is costly, and maintenance might become more costly as the cell ages. The daughter cell might serve as an evolutionarily advantageous way for the cell to renew itself because all the old, damaged cellular machinery is left in the parent cell while the newly created, good cellular machinery is put into the daughter cell. I'm not even convinced that embryonic stem cells are truly immortal. They have unlimited replicative potential for as long as we've been able to test them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up slowing down eventually. Either that or they'd become tumors after a certain number of replications just because of DNA replication errors.

**** Thanks. I didn't know that. It's possible the book is dumbed down for laymen and I haven't finished it yet. Can you elaborate on the nature of damage to cellular machinery ? Is it telemore shortening or something else ? I just wish more experts were working on this.

***** Telomere shortening is separate. Rather than damage to cellular machinery, it's an "intentional" process for determining how many times a cell can replicate, probably intended to prevent uncontrolled cell division and tumors. Telomerase is an enzyme that is expressed during development to increase telomere length but gving that to an adult might give them cancer since turning telomerase on is a very common cancer causing mutation. Also keep in mind that most of the cells in your body don't replicate and are in the resting phase of the cell cycle. It's mainly the stem cells that replicate so that you can grow, heal wounds, and replace damaged cells, etc. That's why old people have slower wound healing and weakened immune systems (the body needs to constantly replace old immune cells).

Damage to cellular machinery is wear and tear. Things like oxidative damage where products of respiration like superoxide anion oxidize cell parts and cause damage. DNA damage from radiation and other causes as well. A lot of the mechanisms for this stuff are not well-understood. Cell damage from trauma, disease, or just everyday stresses is probably what causes most of the initial damage in aging. The reduced ability of adult stem cells to replicate and replace damaged cells as you get older ( probably due to telomeres, cell damage, DNA replication errors, etc.) prevents the body from fixing the damage. But aging is really poorly understood so all of this could be wrong in a few years, and even now these are just hypotheses and there is no scientific consensus on this stuff.

** I thought of this fun metaphor a few days ago:

#+begin_quote
  Diplomacy! It's a subtle dance. An advance here--bold or rash? A retreat there--prudent or cowardly? Does that lush and welcoming valley conceal a vicious ambuscade? Does a powerful artillery piece lie camouflaged at the top of that apparently-undefended hill, ready to repel all comers at the touch of a smoldering fusee?

  Truly, these are dangerous endeavors...

Where are you the best and the worst, on the battlefield of socialization?

- /Grand strategy:/ "What are my goals in this relationship?"

- /Operational strategy:/ "With what conversations can I achieve these goals?":

- /Tactics:/ "With what words can I achieve these conversations?"

- /Logistics:/ "How can I juggle this relationship simultaneously with other concerns?"

([[http://www.kirit.com/Strategy,%20Tactics%20%26%20Logistics][More exhaustive definitions of grand strategy, operational strategy, tactics, and logistics]])

--------------

I'm only a middling operational strategist, and my logistical capability is definitely quite bad (I lack patience--agricultural output to sustain my soldiers if they aren't rushing forward and plundering the enemy's fields)--but I think my grand strategy is fairly realistic (very limited goals--just answers to questions of varying spiciness, in text with the rare illustration), and my tactical ability (skill in English) is excellent.

*** My logistics and grand strategy are weak but I seem amazingly good at Operational Strategy and Tactics when I have the other stuff solid some how.
