Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Publication of the documents led Microsoft to issue a “critical” software patch to close the loophole, but it is unclear whether it was installed on NHS computers. [..] “If large numbers of NHS organisations failed to act on a critical notice from Microsoft two months ago, then whose fault is that?” Anderson said. [..] Alan Woodward, visiting professor of computing at the University of Surrey, said that the attack's success “is likely to be because some organisations have either not applied the patch released by Microsoft, or they are using outdated operating systems”. NHS Digital said it was unable to comment on this at short notice.

  Naruto's angry, Sasuke's sad, Kakashi's an alcoholic, and Sakura is starting to not give a shit anymore. This wasn't what they'd expected from Ninja life, but as Konoha's enemies gather, there's no time for regrets. A strong Team Seven AU with a mystery time-traveller.

** Has anyone been watching the new season of Doctor Who? I've been seeing a lot of praise for it, but all the episodes so far I thought were just okay. As a diehard Clara hater who considers the previous season to be an endurance test (I didn't even like Hell Bent as much as everyone else), I still think consistently okay is a step up. In particular, Thin Ice felt like it was written in response to how much I despised Kill The Moon.

So it's hard for me to call this new season a disappointment, but I still don't think it's a return to form. I was hoping I would see a return to the glory days after The Husbands of River Song became one of my favorite episodes of the series, for reasons besides it being the first episode after Clara had left, but even if this season ends up being forgettable at least it doesn't enrage me with how boring and stupid it is.

--------------

I've been watching the anime Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid (I prefer dubs, sue me), and it's become one of the biggest surprises I've had lately. It's a slice of life comedy the a stoic computer programmer Kobayashi who happens to be a maid otaku and a dragon with godlike powers named who's in love with Kobayashi for some reason so she turns herself into a moe maid, plus several other dragons who show up, and against all odds I actually find it very compelling.

It's hard to pin down exactly why, especially since it features so many tropes and kinds of jokes I've seen before and haven't liked before, but aside from me finally being inoculated to the quirkier aspects of anime I think it's because the show is pretty damn rational. Kobayashi's reason for letting a dragon who openly expresses romantic feelings she doesn't reciprocate move into her house isn't entirely logical, but everything after that checks off all the boxes for rational fiction.

Kobayashi is skilled at problem solving and continuously pursues her goals using the resources at her disposal, the dragons have a logical mindset for their alien values, what little worldbuilding and descriptions of magic we get are consistent, and the story acknowledges the horrific implications of the situation and how it could potentially all go wrong. It's kind of like The Devil is a Part-Timer with all of the roles reversed or Sgt. Frog if it took its story and characters seriously.

I haven't finished it yet, but I get the impression that there is more to it than simply being another slice of life comedy with fantasy elements. I feel like I relate to the characters in ways I don't entirely understand and there is some underlying theme to the story about becoming an adult and managing relationships both friendly and familial. The way it presents it is definitely odd, both in terms of story content and direction, but even if it ends up being just good rather than great I'll still be satisfied.

***** I'm honestly really glad I'm not alone in hating that episode, and Clara dislike.

I studied classroom pedagogy for years in college, and you will never, never convince me that Clara was intended to be a good teacher.

I'd love to see a Game of Thrones crossover video where Arya Stark was reciting her list of names of people to kill and coincidentally added Clara's name to the end, since the actor who played Arya was instrumental to Clara's death. Arya Stark: badass enough to assassinate people from entirely different universes. (crackfic)

*** Re Dragon Maid, I too found it weirdly appealing. I'm a big anime fan, but not when it comes to slice of life. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uejsTnvmudY][Digibro's videos on the show]] were helpful in pointing out some of the stuff that I hadn't even realized I was enjoying. You should probably finish the show before you watch the videos, though - there are some spoilers in there.

**** Those videos are what got me to watch the show in the first place. If I hadn't been confident that I was going to enjoy the show I probably would've never seen it at all. Not because it's slice of life, but because it has fetishistic elements like yuri bait, maids, and gags involving giant boobs that I have zero interest in. I sadly had every surprise spoiled for me, but it still ended up being a good time now that I've finished it.

The ending was a bit underwhelming and I thought the explanation Torru's father gave for his actions contradicted hints given about dragon politics prior to that, but I still like the series enough to check out the manga for more. I think what I like about it is that the flawed characters simultaneously make me feel okay about my insecurities while still encouraging me to keep on working to live life to the fullest.

--------------

EDIT: Other shows I can recommend in the same vein are The Devil is a Part-Timer (only one season, manga has more story) and Ouran High School Host Club. Both are slice of life comedies featuring goofy characters and surprisingly serious stories that made me feel happy afterward.

The only straight-up slice of life show I've liked is the moe-filled season one of K-On! It didn't make me laugh or cry, but it made me smile and helped me relax when I needed both. It's cute for the sake of cute with the bare minimum amount of story necessary, but it knows what it is and embraces it.

*** I stopped watching Dr. Who because I just got sick of Clara, and I'm glad to hear others found her so hard to stomach too. Now that I know she's gone I should probably give catching up a try to see how I feel about the show without her. I highly doubt it will ever be as good (to me) as it was in the 10th's time, but I can hope.

I'm enjoying watching a new anime every week though, so might be awhile before I do.

**** I very highly recommend The Husbands of River Song. It was the first episode after Clara left and proved to me that Doctor Who could be good again. It features the long overdue return one of my favorite reoccurring characters, puts the Doctor in a unique and interesting situation unlike anything I've ever seen, uses that situation to give clever new insight into his relationship with River, and is just plain fun! I couldn't remember the last time I'd had watching Doctor Who.

The whole episode is just a fun adventure with fun characters saying funny dialogue yet the story could still be taken completely seriously. It was the best time I had had with Doctor Who in years and one of my favorite episodes of all time. David Tennent will always be my favorite doctor, but this is the one episode where Capaldi has reached that level and stayed there for the entire episode. Even if the glory days are behind us, I don't think the magic is totally dead yet.
