** I really like that there's immediately a little bit of friction between Fenn and Juniper and that we see some of her worst traits right away. It gets back to what she said in her letter after she died, about not idolizing the dead, and it makes her feel like a more whole and complete person beyond just "comic relief" and "Juniper's love interest."

Also, the idea of Amaryllis being on every TV show (including Aerb's version of Law & Order) is hilarious. It makes sense, it gives her an unparalleled level of control and influence over the public's views on any number of topics, but the idea of channel-surfing and seeing her face as the one constant feels like something right out of a comedy.

  “We did hundreds of impossible things,” replied Raven. “Though technically, we didn't go to p-space, our conceptual selves went there instead. P-space interactions are common, but usually trivial, nothing more than a query about whether or not some object belongs to a certain class, or whether an object is actually an object. To get into p-space, we had to go to the extremes, those entads that allowed for definitional changes, or the creation of new definitions. It was complicated enough that only Uther really understood it. To hear him tell it, it was helpful that we were as famous as we were, because that meant that there was some foundational concept of us to work with in p-space, though that wasn't typically how p-space worked.

** Since there are many positive comments, let me give an alternative opinion. I loved the story, but the pacing has been very weird since after the Doris Finch and Captain Blue exclusion zones. Pretty sure an editor would have had some strong advice.

It has basically been starting to wrap things up, dragon fight, several chapters of wrapping things up, exclusion zones off screen, nice but very short fel seed fight, very short hells "adventure" for something that has been foreshadowed to hell(heh) and back, another chapter of wrapping things up. With Amaryllis mentioning an extremely cool adventure of hers in three sentences, that we'll never get to see.

It feels to me like a (very extended) version of a fanfic author wrapping everything up in one or two chapters to move on. Doesn't feel like the pacing of a natural end.

One more criticism of a story I've actually enjoyed. This clicked for me on the last conversation with the DM: Nobody ever had fun in this. There was no wonder in the journey. That's obviously the story the author wanted to tell, but because of this, even the downtime wasn't "restful" to read. The entire adventure was a chore for mostly everyone in the cast. Contrast it with something like Practical Guide to Evil, which still has high stakes, but also some happy people.

Still, I understand that this may have been intentional. I'm mostly baffled by the pacing.

*** Some of this is, yes, stuff that an editor would probably fix, but the way an editor would be likely to fix it would be to hack at the upstream stuff from (literally) a million words ago. If I could make two major changes to the story, which are basically impossible to do without so much editing and rewriting it would take another year or two of my life, they would be:

1. Less magics available to Juniper, maybe a hard cap of ... five or so. This would unfortunately preclude some stuff that I liked, including a few chapters of magical exploration, but it would cut things down to a more manageable size.
2. More time/outside pressure to force a reason not to go on a ton of side quests.

But a large part of the problem, which started /way/ upstream of all this, is one of the core conceits of the work, which is that there's a honking big world with a vast number of magics and species and adventures to go on, a world that might not be infinite, but could be twenty seasons of a TV show. I wanted it to feel like it was dozens of D&D campaigns mashed together, or fifty splat books, or a hundred mods added onto a videogame, and while I think it largely succeeds in that feeling, it creates some problems, namely that a lot of the stuff Juniper does is stuff that Juniper would necessarily do given the facts as presented in the story. The choice then is:

1. Skip over them, and hope the audience doesn't notice.
2. Do them entirely off-screen.
3. Do them on-screen, in brief.
4. Retroactively edit them out.
5. Do them in full, even if it screws with the pacing and you don't really have anything to "say".

WtC does a combination of these, largely with the exception of the first one, which I think is particularly bad. The best way to handle them, in my opinion, is the retroactive edit, but in a work of serial fiction, especially one of this length, that's not really that feasible (and I don't really think that I've ever seen it done, not at the scale it would need to be done here).

A lot of the pacing that feels like the overpowered party is going through a checklist of things they can easily do for some reward before they do what they think is the final quest is ... because that's what they're doing, in-universe. I unfortunately don't think that's really enough to justify it, though I /have/ been mostly enjoying it on a scene-by-scene level ... mostly.

(I also don't love the idea of time pressure forcing a premature end, because in my mind, part of the metanarrative is there as a counterpoint or complement to one of the central themes of suicide. They want to get to the end of it all because the thought of this going on forever is intolerable in various ways. Having the ending forced on them through outside forces is counter to that in a way that I really don't like. Even now, with the events of this chapter, at least the decision is largely as a result of one character's actions, which thematically fits better. Not that it's a /clean/ theme, but I do like my messy themes.)

*tl:dr; Mostly agree, and it's been a reason writing was slower for a bit, and I'd do it differently in the future, but I'm still more-or-less happy with the work given some of the unfortunate constraints I placed it under and some of the hard-to-execute things I've been dumb enough to try executing.*

(This is more than I usually say about writing, hopefully it's not too much. Once WtC is done, I'll have a post mortem that goes more in-depth about what I thought worked and what I felt didn't, and why.)

**** If you ever feel like talking shop here or in the eventual retrospective, there are a few editorial bits I would love to hear your thoughts on. In no particular order:

1) Something that always stood out to me was how /awful/ Juniper's adventure would be as an actual tabletop campaign. For all the early talk with the DM about Juniper acting like he'd want his players to act, there's a lot of mechanical and DM stuff that would be very aggravating or borderline toxic in the real world. I was expecting it was an intentional touch that was going to be brought up later on, but as far as I can recall it never was. Was this at all intentional, or just an unfortunate side effect of having to make the actual story engaging?

2) Tying into the game structure and the weird power curve they followed, I always thought that soul magic would be a prime candidate for an editor to brutally execute, since with 20/20 hindsight it becomes apparent how heavily they relied on it to game the system. Are you ultimately happy with its inclusion, or would you have stripped it out entirely if the story weren't far too large to comprehensively edit?

3) It felt like a lot of the late story's reliance on soul magic and loophole abuse stemmed from the weird, suboptimal build that Juniper committed to long before he understood the system. Was that an intentional writing decision? Did it work like you wanted it to?

4) Probably best held for the retrospective, but I would be really curious to know which parts of the story you like and feel were really well-executed, and which if any you'd wave a magic wand and revise if you could.

I actually think this worked really well in Chapter 221 (Targets Of Opportunity). But I think it'd work better if burning down the checklist took up an entire arc, with the more interpersonal developments filling in the gaps. Instead the recent arcs feel more like they're composed of mini-arcs glued together, with the focus and pacing suddenly shifting to accommodate. Interleaving these pieces more, and papering over the places this could be jarring by inserting the checklist quests into scene changes, could smooth things without a full story edit.

(And while I'm a huge fan of structural editing, I don't think a traditional full-book edit makes sense for a work that's already 15 times longer than the average paperback. Reworking things more than 20 or so chapters apart would take an entire editing team, not just an editor.)

Nice hearing your thoughts, even when pulling back the curtain must go against your natural instincts.

The few times Joon seems to actually have fun he gets basically scolded for it, like after the fight with Onion.

As for the pacing, it makes complete sense to me, and is spelled out explicitly in the narrative. The stuff that's getting skipped over just... doesn't matter.

From what we've seen of Valencia, it sounds like a devil's persuasion powers would make it quite easy to talk a rune mage into creating some terrible device via a possessed non-anima, and we know from Joon's venture into the runeforge that you can plan out an entire design without actually having magic yourself.

It's definitely a serious task, but given that there are literally trillions of infernals, surely someone would try - if you succeed, you'll be given all the accolades the hells can offer and thousands of mortals 24/7.

Plus any individual non-anima seems to have competition between devils controlling them, they are not exclusively owned. So there's an incentive for any individual devil controller to just maximize suffering in the short term to benefit themselves, rather than follow a plan with a longterm and abstract payoff.

At least until infernal unification.

And the rune magic antimatter bomb required a lot of research and resources in fixed and heavily regulated locations (runeforges), so creating a rune magic exclusion would have been a hard target for infernals to manage.

*Description:* when you die with the helldiver and diamond ironman harcore settings on, you get a GAME OVER screen. all game features are subsequently disabled.

i triggered this by going after fel seed and getting killed. the thing is, there are still features that allow me to continue the game. a companion did a quest to get me out of hell, and now i'm back in the main game, but everything is still disabled, the interface won't load, and several progress-critical quests are locked. pls fix.

*Steps to reproduce:*

- turn on helldiver
- turn on diamond ironman hardcore
- die because of stupid gm bullshit
- you get a game over screen, the interface is locked off, you go to hell
- have a companion travel to the outer reach and build a gate out of hell
- take the gate out of hell
- you are now alive and theoretically able to complete all the quests, except the interface is still locked. you don't get messages or level ups even if you complete the quests

Your motivations are, along with your habits, right at the deepest essence of who you are. If Arthur consented and then the reason for giving that consent is taken away, that core motivation removed, is it really the same person giving the consent anymore?

I think that there's a fairly strong argument (depending, of course, on *what* is removed) that it wouldn't be the same person anymore, and therefore that the consent shouldn't be considered binding.

Don't get me wrong; I don't think that present-me should never be accountable for the actions and promises of past me, or that future-me should not be responsible for present-me's actions and promises. There are consequences for breaking your promises. But anyone who says that someone should never, ever break a promise should ponder that keeping promises have consequences too, and those consequences are not absolved by the promise.

Solcace was notably absent, but I guess she's fulfilled her role to some degree, and the focus shifted to the locus. (Interesting that the DM nixed the DMPC idea). I feel kinda bad for her, she got what she wanted, with the locus being freed, but it then proceeded to reject her, keeping her sick and thinking of her as a jailer. Then its final resolution came from Juniper without her involvement. I guess this maybe shows the negative side of the Locus's nature, the inherent unpredictability and resistance to patterns means that it also won't express gratitude or consistent affection.

I mean, while I sort of agree, the issue is that the problems in the DFZ were more than just "the Dorises are shitty to each other." The Dorises were shitty to each other in large part because of the extreme resource scarcity, which they could only overcome by murder-cloning. Without murder-cloning, they wouldn't even have the clothes on their backs, and cloning without murdering doesn't fix the problem, because it creates more mouths to feed to match the resources it supplies. They can't trade with the outside world to overcome this either, because they're under brutal sanctions in addition to having very little to offer in trade.

The DFZ had severe social problems, but those problems were largely a result of the material conditions. You need to change the material conditions to actual fix things, and doing that in a purely mundane way (i.e. building infrastructure that can sustain the population without murder-cloning) would take decades.

Resource scarcity was largely not the limiting factor, and in fact, Dorises are already shown being able to do something very similar, just more messy:

#+begin_quote
  There was only a little bit of looting before we got going. One of the ways that Doris's power was busted was that it cloned over her equipment too, but the big drawback was that the clone's gear would disappear after twenty-four hours. The loophole was that if a clone with an hour left on the clock for their equipment made a clone, that new clone would have their clock reset. The answer then, at least some of the time, was to just make a clone, kill it, and take its stuff, keeping both sets of equipment until the timer was up, when you would find out which one had the longer timer. The clone would naturally resist that, but the Dorises had methods of clone production that would put the clone in a position to be easily murdered. Most of the equipment that was laying on the ground, if looted, would simply disappear by the next day.
#+end_quote

and later

#+begin_quote
  We saw other Dorises as well, though usually only briefly, or peeking out through windows. My crown let me see through the eyes of those holed up in their ugly buildings, and I regretted looking, because I saw a Doris going about the process of butchering her clone, and another in the middle of eating raw chunks of flesh. It was no secret that this was how the Dorises kept themselves fed, but it was still disturbing to see. A few of those rooms had tiny closet-like structures, the entrances so small that you couldn't get out. Those, I knew, were used for clone killing.
#+end_quote

That is to say "make a clone such that you can easily kill it and take its stuff" was the default already (though available only to those who could secure a regular murder hole), and adding in "actually, you don't need to make the clone, just make the stuff" reduces the inherent violence/murder, and some of the friction, but it's relying on a process of eliminating resource scarcity that's already present.

So the "cruelty-free cloning" stations would be important not because they'd provide new resources, but because they'd represent an easier way to access resources that isn't hoarded away or require violence, and would therefore facilitate trust between Dorises.

On the other hand, the chapter as written says "a few factors involved in that, but the biggest thing that had happened was that resource scarcity had been virtually eliminated". That's a little odd if the takeaway is supposed to be that resource scarcity wasn't the limiting factor.

I don't know, I kind of figured a solution to the DFEZ (beyond what was already shown) would focus on the progressive increase in trust, and the social structures Mary and BGD would put in place.

Edit: A better way of saying it, or maybe thinking about it, is that when people aren't desperate for food, clothing, shelter, and safety, they do a lot better when asked to have faith in each other. Grak's wards /help/ with that, in that they lower duplication costs/friction, as does flooding in entads, but a lot of it is indeed coordination problems, many of which stem from the attitude that Dorises hold toward other Dorises.

**** I don't see it as murder.

Each clone has memories and agency.

If I understand correctly, when they merge, they all gain the memories. That's it. The memories are not erased, they are compiled.

If a clone is "murdered" because they get all the other memories added to theirs, then Amaryllis is committing suicide every time she does it.

Is a merge an overwrite of each clones (and Amarllis's) mind, and does it change the person that they are? More an append than an overwrite. And all experience is adding information, and may change your life.

A clone was given a body, a mind, and memories. In return, they are expected to share their new memories, and accept other's memories. They are not slaves or automatons.

If later a clone decided to renege on the agreement, I think Primaryllis has some moral authority to enforce the agreement.

As far as the initial agreement, it was made with full informed consent, because at the moment of clone creation, both sides were effectively Primaryllis who was informed and consented.

If you ask me to sing a song for you, and I change my mind and retract my consent, you should not coerce me.

But what if we agree that I will sing a song if you buy me dinner, and after dinner I change my mind? Is that retracted consent, or violation of contract?

***** A person is not merely the sum of their memories. There's also motivations and a body to pursue them with. The clones had their own goals that diverged from Mary's, and now they're no longer free to pursue them. You could claim that those motivations are still present, somewhere inside her psyche, but they've clearly been drowned out by the rest. She finds them abhorrent now, and the clones no longer have the option to engage in a physical and emotional relationship with each other.

No, that's Amaryllis killing them all those times, it just isn't murder because they all usually consent to it (meaning it's suicide from their perspective), except in this case.

****** I guess we just disagree on the concept of killing.

I think that destroying a person's memories and personality is killing.

Adding on to their memories is not killing.

YMMV.

Two clones decided to have a relationship. If any or all clones decide in the future to have similar relationships, then I hope Primaryllis will not attempt to coerce them to stop. If she does, that would be wrong. But coercing them to merge, as was previously agreed to, is a different thing.

  She nodded. “Two of them were,” she let out a breath. “Lovers. It was utter narcissism.” She blushed slightly at the memory, then paled. The muscle in her cheek went taut. “I didn't manage to convince them. They didn't think that I would have the same love for myself as they had for each other. They argued that they could be just as effective without merging. I just merged them anyway.”
#+end_quote

The lovers are hilarious :)\\
Also damn, that's the closest she's ever had to an internal conflict, in a while.

What about the third Mary? Did she get merged or not?\\
Did she get pregnant?\\
Did she set up a void factory to blow up, if she's merged against her will?\\
Did she learn Spirit Magic and/or set up a suicide precommitment as deterrent using linear protocol?

Is that the Maryiest Mary of them all?\\
I must know more!
