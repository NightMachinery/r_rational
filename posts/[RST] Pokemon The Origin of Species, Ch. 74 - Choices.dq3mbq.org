** Me 3 hours ago: Blue is being a major asshole and reacting ridiculously to this whole thing.

Blue: "What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for /Blue/ the way Blue cares for him. "

Me: Nevermind, favorite character, I love you.

​

Jokes aside, I am so happy this chapter happened and I'm so glad it looks like Blue is finally coming to terms with The Whole Aiko Thing. The match seemed brutally unfair, though, and even though I know logically "Surge set up the challenge this way to teach *everyone* a lesson about difficult choices", it kind of feels like "Surge royally fucked over Bretta and Vlad's chances to get a badge just to waggle a finger at Blue and say 'see how it feels??'". Like, they set up a whole building with Voltorb and unleashed a Dragonite on a bunch of kids just so Blue would maybe realize "damn, I've kind of been an ass." At first I thought it was a coincidence but then Sabra straight up says "Yeah, we tried to make this just like the Red and Aiko situation." It seems...mean, to the other trainers. Although I guess this is mostly remedied by Surge's offer to give the two a 1v1 battle the very next day.

Still, fantastic chapter, and as always I'm excited for the next!

*** So I may have done this too subtly, but I wanted to communicate that this isn't actually what happened by noting first that Surge had shot down Sabra's idea for the last challenge because it would have been too hard, and second that Sabra is specifically not saying "This is a lesson for you," but rather "I want to see how your people deal with situations like this."

I should probably clarify this more in the chapter, since [[/u/knickersinaknit]] and [[/u/memes_of_production]] had similar interpretations. Remember that Sabra lost her friend and one of her mentors in the exact same way that Blue lost Aiko. It isn't actually /about/ Blue, he's just the person who happens to be involved in both what happened between Jack/Aiko/Red, and the gym's first opportunity to simulate that sort of situation.

***** The basic idea is that preparing people to go through such situations can be really valuable in general. A specific example concerning our protagonists is that if Blue and Red had encountered a scenario like this before what happened, and talked about it, and there was a narrative about how it's okay whatever people choose already in place... their split might not have happened.

***** In my mind, there's two parts to this.

The first is directed at Blue in particular, where it translates to "I want to see how you react when your friends are forced to make the same choice Red did and not all of them pick the response you want."

The second is that this is functionally equivalent to military training, specifically tailored to group cohesion and leadership. The 'squad', as it were, is being presented with a dilemma. A dilemma, in military terms, is roughly defined as 'a set of two or more problems to where the correct answer for one results in an incorrect answer for the others, and responding to none of them is the worst option of all'. The test isn't so much to find out if you can 'beat' it (you can't, that's why its a dilemma), but if you can come to and act on a 'good enough' decision fast enough to suffer the least loss. How you respond to both the choice and the resultant loss is the whole point.

**** Well, it *is* about Blue, insomuch as he is one of the Deuteragonists of the story, and we the audience are reading his saga. But that's obviously not what you meant. :D

However, what really makes me happy about this one is that it *directly* addresses Blue's attitude toward Red, and shines a light on the former's hypocrisy--or, at least his foolish attitude toward the situation. Blue has held this grudge for far too long, and getting to watch not one but *SIX* of his 'friends' be forced into making the same choice Red did *might* be enough of a wakeup call. Especially since a majority of them made the same decision that Red did.

*** I'd agree with that, it did make the lesson feel rather heavy-handed. I know Blue's one of the main characters, but I feel this chapter really leaned on that point.

EDIT: after thinking on this a little more, I think the chapter could be improved by keeping those 'sometimes you have to make hard choices and there are no correct answers' lesson in there, but maybe Blue could also have a humbling realization that he wasn't the only one who had to make that choice during the Zapdos attack. I doubt Aiko was the only trainer who perished. I think the understanding that he's not alone in his feelings of rage and disappointment in those who made a save-themselves choice could be a great motivation to share what happened at the chapter's end.

**** Yeah, I have no problems with the lesson itself, it just seems unrealistically centered on Blue. Instead of Sabra being like "yep, we set this all up just so you, specifically, could realize this lesson", I expected it to be the opposite; Blue saying something like "was this all just to teach me something?" and Sabra is like "what? no. you think you're that important? We just wanted to instill this valuable lesson in every trainer etc etc." That doesn't necessarily need to be the full truth--After all, Sabra has the most motive to set up the scenario this way, because she saw the effect Aiko's death had on Red--but I think her saying it out loud is a bit tell-don't-show. Blue realizing it on his own seems more natural. He's a smart guy, after all.

#+begin_quote
  What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for /Blue/ the way Blue cares for him. "
#+end_quote

Blue would rather his grandfather stayed safe, rather than risking his life for him. Blue has no such feelings about Red, he would rather Red walked towards death for him. Doesn't that unambiguously mean /he/ doesn't care for Red the same way /he/ cares about his grandfather?...

The way I see it, if you decide you prefer somebody died for you, rather than not, well then you don't love them, do you.

If you think you would die for somebody, great! The second you demand the reverse, and “can't forgive” the suspicion that reverse is not true, you overstep. Love is a gift freely given, no strings attached, otherwise it's something else.

Aren't good guys supposed to make sure friends don't follow them off cliffs? I am just coming down from watching Fullmetal Alchemist, and the show is chock-full of people telling their loved ones to not die for them, on hopeless odds. Blue himself does exactly that, but only for his grandfather.\\
[SPOILERS FOR FMAB] spoiler One of the tensest scenes, Roy struggling against the decision, and when he says “All right” you think he broke. When he adds “All right, Lieutenant” and you realize he chose to hear Riza instead, it's just so powerful. I can't see Alfonse preferring Ed died for him, I can't see Ling preferring Fu and LanFan, his guards(!) died for him, even though it's literally in the job description.

It's not supposed to be an equal relationship. And Blue wouldn't really want one of his peers trying to act like a parent to him.

**** I dont think Blue actually wants Red to ealk to his death. He wants Red to be willing to do it like Oak did. He is worried that despite their bond, Red wouldnt risk his life to save him due to his rational logic. Something linked to their previous arguments where Red was too analytical and cold.

It's not wyat Red actually does, it is the thought that counts.

If someone is willing to put your interests above their own, it means that they care for you regardless of whether you want them to or not. If someone isn't willing to do it, it means they don't care about you as much, also regardless of whether or not you want them to.

This is what "it is the thought that counts" means. Love isn't necessarily about what someone does, it's about what they're willing to do. If someone doesn't help you because you told them not to, it's very different from someone not helping you because they don't want to.

******* It isn't about putting Blue's interests above his own, it's about dying when there is no hope. But I think you're right, it's the thought that counts; however Blue isn't going to ask him to not do it, as far as I see.

He asked his grandfather; he won't ask Red. Even Blue acknowledges the difference in what his feelings regarding his grandfather are (he handwaves “but it's different, it doesn't count” at his thoughts, but he noticed)

He wants Red to be willing + he won't discourage it = it is the same as wanting it, as opposed to actively not wanting it (like heroes usually do when it comes to the people they love; they actively not want them to die trying to save them when the risk is too great)

******** I won't deny that Blue isn't thinking completely logically, just that he has a rather good point. He justifies his thinking with the fact that Oak dying isn't just a risk, it's practically a certainty due to the pressure. There is still a bit of hypocrisy but he is right about about that.

Moreover, Red and Blue are partners. He treats Red differently because they were supposed to fight together against the stormbringers. It's what they agreed on and a bit of a risk to ones life is implied, as opposed to Oak teleporting into a situation that could kill him just from the presence. Blue and Red are supposed to trust each other as battle partners, Red's decision doesn't just make Blue doubt that Red would die for him, it makes him wonder how much of a risk Red would take and how dangerous a situation would have to be before Blue can't rely on him.

As I said, I don't completely agree with Blue here. I'm also only speaking from Blue's perspective and obviously he doesn't actually know what Red thinks or feels.

But when Blue was watching it all unfold... as he watched Vlad decide, between a doomed attempt to save his friend, and a chance save himself and the civilian...

Blue didn't feel an answer. He didn't find a solution. On both sides, there was only pain. And that was true even before Vlad rushed away from the gate, away from the badge he'd earned, to try and save Bretta in the first place.

It was too much like Red choosing to come to Vermilion in the first place, and the comparison made it clear that for Blue it's never just been a matter of cowardice vs selflessness.

He understands why Gramps came for him during the storm. Of course he does. He doesn't feel worthy of his grandfather's life, and the risk is just too high in a way it's not with Daisy: a certainty rather than a risk, poison rather than a dice roll. But people still face certain death for those they care about, even if the recipient doesn't want them to. He can both not want Gramps to make that choice for him, and understand why he does.

What he couldn't forgive was that Red didn't care for Aiko the way his grandfather cares for him. That he might not care for Blue the way Blue cares for him.

Surge said the act couldn't be judged, but Blue still feels the hurt, the disappointment. Is that not judgement?

He's not sure.

Though I did honestly think it was a typo, outside of this context I certainly would be just sharing thoughts, not actually suggesting changes. I certainly don't expect an author to agree with me on my points, I enjoy seeing their vision unfold.

This sentence is a little confusing, though. Maybe it can be reworded as "It was too much like Red choosing to come [to Vermilion] to help deal with the storm in the first place"; it might just be me, but it took a few moments to recall "Red chose to come to Vermilion to help deal with Zapdos fallout; he wasn't already present". There's probably a less wordy/awkward phrasing.

I have some phrasing/structure thoughts on the next two paragraphs as well, if you'd like me to share them publicly or privately.

The second sentence is tricky to read, because it's just hard to express this in English. Additionally, the next sentence follows directly as a contrast with the former, so that one in turn is easier to understand if it's moved to the same paragraph. It's also a tiny bit confusing that you switch antecedents when you get to the last sentence, although that seems fairly minor given the amount of times you directly name the characters.

I thought I had a particular rephrasing in mind earlier, but I guess I don't anymore, unfortunately. I'll keep thinking about it...

** This is one of those chapters where the fact that most authors commit hard to solely the written word becomes a problem. The battle scene here was in desperate need of a map, for the reader. It's tons of new locales, new Pokemon, and newish people, so getting a full grasp of the scene is a challenge. Visual elements can cut through so much of that! I think few authors really consider it, and they should.

Additionally, I am withholding judgement till after the Big Speech in the next chapter, but I don't believe this was an effective way to teach the lesson intended. Like sure Vlad ran to help out the other trainer - he wasn't in any danger! All that was on the line was a badge. I'm sure he cared, don't get me wrong, but the scenario it's meant to mimic is one where you literally would have died. I feel like this would teach a false confidence, like you have practiced a set of tradeoffs when in reality they are completely on another plane.

(None of this says it's bad writing, it's okay for the characters Blue and Surge to make mistakes like that. But we will see if the world treats this like a real "test")

*** I disagree about the map. The chaos and confusion reflects that of the characters. /They/ don't have an exact map of what's going on. Everything seems OK until they get bushwhacked of of nowhere, or wander through a minefield, or have to carefully move through animals that can be spooked into a stampede at any moment.

I certainly do agree about the descriptions of the Mon. I get that this is a Pokemon story and most people will have a firm grasp of the creatures involved. But... there are often new readers who have little experience with mon who are told that the story is good from others and come to read it, knowing only the basic level of pokemon's 'cultural osmosis'. Also, there's over 800 of the critters now. A bit more descriptivesness on the individual creatures would probably help give people a good mental image, while also giving the veterans a new way to see old mon.

** I've read and re-read and I still don't understand the choice Vlad made nor how it is similar to Red's.

In Red's case, he chose between (A) heroically risking his life for a likely awful outcome, or (B) the rationally optimal but cowardly option.

Vlad chose between (A) running back out there to save his friend, likely with an awful outcome, or (B) staying put with his civilian to get a badge, the cowardly but selfishly-optimal option.

So that adds up, and I thought I got it. But then in-story it says that Vlad decided between running away with the civilian or helping his friend, as if him pedaling out there was a given. What is going on? That seems like there's no way for him to win, because if he leaves his friend to die, the dragonite just catches up and eats him too. It seems like it's not a good parallel to Red's situation at all.

[[/u/DaystarEld]] there are like 3+ separate comments in this thread from confused people. Could you clarify how the two scenes are supposed to be parallels? (Also as always, thanks for writing this story, it's consistently a source of delight.)

If Blue expects Red to sacrifice himself in an attempt to save Aiko, the way his grandfather would do for him, then he ought to also expect Aiko to listen to Red when he says /don't go in, it's too dangerous/ the way a child should listen to a parent.

Remember that most of the regions in the world this story takes place in are now at peace, after a great war nobody wants to repeat. There will still be militaries and such, and maybe even small brushfire proxy wars, but they are just coming down off their World War analog. However, in every war, crime syndicates flourish in the homelands of the combatants, to the point where they can even gain international influence. This happened both with the US Mafia and the Japanese Yakuza in the real world.

Surge knows exactly what kind of harm a small group of people with Pokemon can do. He also knows that there are basically the equivalent of living nuclear weapons flying through the sky or running across the land, and it's only a matter of time until one or more are caught.

Basically, he's not worried about the most recent war, but the nature of the 'next' war, and he wants his people to be ready.

*** In the section just after Blue realizes Surge's trying to prep them for war, there're two consecutive paragraphs where Lizzy is the named speaker. (The part where the dialogue is "...pretty big risk,", "What if they get hurt?", and "It would be on them, wouldn't it?") It looks like either one of the speakers wasn't supposed to be Lizzy, or that second dialogue was actually a response by someone else, which should probably be on another paragraph.

** Having a tangela strapped to your back sounds heavy.

According to Bulbapedia, tangela weigh 77.2 lbs. (35.0 kg). Given that all the characters are in their early teens, a tangela could easily weigh half as much as the person carrying it, which is an extremely heavy load for a sustained hike.

Not to mention whatever other gear Elaine or Hitoshi was carrying.

** Hi Daystar

I was wondering what was your opinion of gender dimorphism in Pokemon, especially where it results in the male and female being classified as different species. Especially with Nidoqueen and Nidoking. Sure they have slightly different movesets and stats distribution, but Meowstic also has different movesets and could have different abilities, and yet they're classified as one species. Gallade and Froslass are classified separately being a gender specific evolutionary branch compared to the one both genders could access, Mothim and Wormadam are the male and female of their species, but are classified separately.

Speaking of the Nido line, what's your take on Nidorina and Nidoqueen being unable to breed? Treat it as a game conceit? After all, while menopause is a thing that can happen, that is a reflection of old age. Why should any lifeform just reaching the prime of its life suddenly become infertile?

And then, there are the one-gender only Pokemon without clear opposite gender counterparts. For example, fanon has it that Tauros and Miltank are counterparts, but this isn't reflected in the gameplay. Are you going with fanon and treating this one as a game conceit? Because that doesn't solve the issue for all one-gender Pokemon.

And then, there's the basic question of why are the male and female of the species even classified as separate in the first place.

I'm not Daystar, but this isn't a hard question. You see this in eusocial animals, like bees or naked mole rats. The “soldier” class doesn't breed, they simply increase the relative fitness of their family group, passing their genes on through close relatives instead. The family group acts as one superorganism, for evolutionary purposes.

As for gender being treated as different species, it strikes me that you could explain it as a subjective, culturally-based distinction made for entirely practical purposes. For example, gender doesn't really matter if you have a Dunsparce, since there aren't even superficial differences between a male Dunsparce and a female Dunsparce. At the end of the day, male or female, you're going to be getting an inexplicably lucky snake-bumblebee critter. But with a Glalie and a Froslass, they not only have different learnsets and radically different appearances, they also have different typing as well. The difference isn't simply aesthetic, in terms of battling (the most important metric) they behave as differently as different species.

Absolutely this! From a design perspective, it's clear that the games have taken a while to settle on an effective way to represent sexual dimorphism (potentially/probably limited by technology, too), but it's pretty cool that we can also take the perspective that hey, the definition of "species" can get very, very fuzzy.

Red's got a lot of work to do, hah!

Hmm, true, but it doesn't apply to every Pokemon where the gender results in different gameplay. Meowstic for example. The females are geared towards combat while the males are geared towards support.

But if the Pokemon world simply didn't have consistent and objective standards for when precisely the male and female should be classified separately, I suppose that answers that question.

***** Yeah, the simple answer is that as the games got more complex and added first genders without differentiating species, then different appearances by gender, then different stats and moves and evolutions by gender, the whole concept originally set up was turned on its head.

One way to resolve this is to say that Nidoran(M/F) are a single specie of pokemon which diverges drastically by gender. I think it's safe to dismiss the fertility stuff as a game conceit, but we could also do interesting things with it by saying something like:

"Nidoran live in family clusters that always breed before they evolve, then the parents basically just protect their kids until they're able to breed and evolve, after which the grandparents are now nidoking/queen of their families."

*** With the Nidos it's clear that it's an artefact of the game. They were going for differences in the sexes before Pokemon even had sex as a part of their data and that was the only way to do it in Gen I, though that did allow for different move sets and stats in a way that the modern method doesn't allow. As for Nidorina's and Nidoqueen's infertility, I'm pretty sure that was a coding error that has been grandfathered into every subsequent game in accordance with some internal design rule of Game Freak's.

** I just caught back up to this series since starting my college term and I'm always impressed by the breadth of Pokemon you utilize. I remember one of the psychics during red's section owning a Torracat, a Pokemon native to Alola. The attention put into using Pokemon from a wide variety of regions helps main the world feel more real, as it's extremely likely to meet someone with foreign Pokemon with how global the PC system seems to be.

With the decrease in Pokemon present in the upcoming games, its nice to see that those (likely) left behind are not forgotten.

*** I agree, but in my case I couldn't care less about Leaf's "save all the pokemon" goals. I'm actually shocked Blue can put up with her knowing her attitudes... Maybe no one informed him about how Leaf went nuts trying to save the pokemon instead of the civilians during the Zapdos attack. I was expecting the big fallout to be over Leaf, for that reason - with Red following his heart and supporting Leaf despite contradictory personal values, while Blue (not being emotionally biased due to a lack of crush on Leaf) being furious with her for caring more about the pokemon over people.

Either way, I'm with you on being way more interested in the three of them travelling and having adventures together than following Red's training and Leaf's vegan attitude.

** Criticism: you set up the 'Surge is preparing us for /war./' realization as if it were some big reveal for the readers, when it was clearly only a reveal for the character. It's not a twist to the readers, having experienced Surge's interlude.

This would be totally fine, if you had described Blue's emotions more after realizing it. He immediately goes back to looking at the challenge, and doesn't think much about the Zebstrika's strafing move as a war tactic either.

If you make it clear later that Blue didn't think much about it because he tends to hold in bad emotions until after the adrenaline leaves him, then this part becomes amazing writing rather than a problem. But it did feel unsatisfying to read.
