** I had been going to submit this to the Weirdtopia contest, but wasn't able to finish in time, so here it is as it stands.

Now, fair warning: I'm a bit stuck on this one. I haven't the foggiest how this ends.

Oh, and, I'm back. Magical Creatures should, with luck and proper fate manipulation, be starting up again soon.

** What happened to Care and Feeding by the way? Hiatus or did I just miss something?

Sorry for not commenting on this here story just now. I'm on my tiny phone, which isn't conductive to extended reading sessions. I'll definitely read it in the next 1-3 days though.

**** Wow. It took me almost a month to get back here. Sorry about that. But now I finally read it.

So, comments.\\
First of all, I don't understand the sad ending. At all. What made Beauty sleep? What made her momentarily wake up and then sleep again?

Also, the illusion of this being a translation didn't really hold up. Three things broke it. One are the explanations of things that the original wouldn't have to explain due to being more than obvious in the author's society. Another are the weird parentheses. Then there's the fact that many parts of this story read more like an accurate account of events, with all their mundanity and happenstance, that it doesn't seem much like a myth or fable but more like a factual explanation (in a fantasy setting) of something moving and wonderful. Lastly there is the specifically limited vocabulary that is probably there to convey simpleness but simply wouldn't be there if this was an actual translation from a language with poor vocabulary. Not like this anyway. If a language uses the same word for blood and sap for instance and the story itself never talks about actual bleeding trees then wouldn't "blood" be the more natural translation?

Those things don't necessarily make for a worse narration, but they do kind of break the suspension of disbelief when it comes to this being a translation.

The story also definitely broke conventional narrative construction, what with having no exciting high point and a kind of anticlimactic and unsatisfying ending that explains very little. It was mostly just interesting, curious and a little moving.

I also have to say that this story only really works in tandem with your other story, Care and Feeding. I feel like if this would have been my first exposure to Pandemonium I would have enjoyed it much less, and at the same time like I would be missing out on details in the serial proper if I had skipped this.

Some random things I noticed while reading:

#+begin_quote
  and for the same reason horribly kills anyone who does anything consciously nonconsensual by spiking them with rock spines or strangling them with plants or some other environmentally appropriate wrath.
#+end_quote

So this confirms that "Spiking" is actually a summary execution for all kinds of nonconsensual actions. Maybe even the ones that don't really deserve it and/or are understandable mistakes (in judgement, not communication).

#+begin_quote
  if you're on Earth or newly arrived from there, please be kind to the brothers Grimm.
#+end_quote

So Cheryl is bonded to an Earth Human or at least mostly relates to those.

#+begin_quote
  while others bled thick green sap
#+end_quote

Does this confirm that the 4 succubus houses are actually biologically different in ways that go beyond preference of the seed-host? It seems at least as if someone that grows their seed into a Sade can't really be into yellow-blooded monsters.

#+begin_quote
  We say boy, we say girl, and we think of femmes in slinky dresses or masculines in shining steel, but to the villagers this difference was no greater or less than the others.
#+end_quote

This specifically makes me think that the story was not directly translated from a book written within Pandemonium society since such things are obvious beyond explanation for anyone who lived even a month in Sade Hall.

#+begin_quote
  So it seemed good, and then things went wrong. Or at least, stopped going right.
#+end_quote

I don't actually know what went so wrong in this section. The way that line was phrased made me expect something really dramatic being foreshadowed. Like someone getting actually hurt.

#+begin_quote
  and though the morning peeking in the mouth of woke her
#+end_quote

Mouth of what? The cave?

#+begin_quote
  until a vine had caught her wing and, wrapping tight, sliced it off.
#+end_quote

Huh. So the fairy-like person did/wanted to do something non-consensual? Also, surprising that she survived the Spiking. I mean from your previous comments I'd think that the environment would either do its best to kill her or give a deliberately painful punishment. Doing something highly lethal but survivable through luck and happenstance seems... inefficient for any kind of maximizer.

#+begin_quote
  She was green-sap and black-sap, Beauty-Beast.
#+end_quote

Wait, she actually bleeds in two colors that don't truly mix? How does that work?

I don't know if this comment is helpful but I hope it didn't disappoint too much, given the month long wait. Looking forward to reading the chapter you recently posted. You definitely deserve all the love and nectar you can swallow ;)

***** No worries! I'm glad you read.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The answer here, of course, is that it's not the ending - that's why the [WIP] tag. Looking back, it's indeed not clear that this isn't just unedited but unfinished narratively (because I can't figure out exactly where to go from that point). Hence you're asking after things that are /supposed/ to be mysterious at that point in the story - and I don't tend to do sad endings overall.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Spoilers follow.

Hmm. I've been trying here to convey something about the culture of this part of Sade Hall, which is that the consent protection to a certain extent gets treated like a nearby volcano or faultline: it's notionally cataclysmically dangerous, but is rarely observed to do anything more than make a warning rumble here and there, and so due to the constellation of poor (except that the stopped clock happens in this case to be telling the right time) risk assessment heuristics common to human-style consciousness people simultaneously mythologize it as being wrathful and volatile out of proportion with reality while /acting/ like the actual probability of cataclysm is far smaller than the data would seem to suggest (except that volcanoes don't take into account personal behavior).

#+begin_quote
  Those things don't necessarily make for a worse narration, but they do kind of break the suspension of disbelief when it comes to this being a translation.
#+end_quote

As Cheryl herself says:

#+begin_quote
  Note also that I'm focusing here on /telling the stories/. I've tried where possible to convey the 'feel' of the original Infernal text relative to its source context (as best I could figure that out, connotation marks can only take you so far) by rendering things in ye olde Anglish or other such kinks, and I'm not trying /not/ to write pleasing sentences, but at the end of the day when I'm translating these stories I am clarity's bitch.

  Huh. So the fairy-like person did/wanted to do something non-consensual?
#+end_quote

Good catch, thank you. The intention here is that this was a genuine accident and Beauty saved her, but based on how the consent protection is seen working elsewhere that's not clear. //me adds to fix notes/

Also, on a purely word-of-god level: the lower bound is - it's generally observed - intention you're in the process of acting on, and most people seem to observe it not to act until the absolute last minute, and in the most minimal possible way for the situation.

#+begin_quote
  Wait, she actually bleeds in two colors that don't truly mix? How does that work?
#+end_quote

Nectar/ichor and fluid dynamics is an interesting relationship. It seems to operate more by meaning or something like that but I'm not exactly sure...better go do some detailed investigation. :)

Thanks :) And don't worry - I've already filed you under "useful negative critique".
