Actually, having the simulacrum supply its non-shared memories back to him sounds like a very good idea. Sure, they can't just seamlessly integrate, the author has made that clear, but Zorian is skilled enough to make memory packets.

Still risky, of course.

Yes, I would expect Zorian to be able to achieve something with his mind magic, eg a memory packet. However, he's nowhere near the level I would expect him to need in order to attempt any kind of personality integration, even with quite small divergences. He may be a master mind mage by human standards, but remember his reaction to opening the Matriarch's memory packet. He's way behind true masters.

  Spear of Resolve seemed to have found a way to turn part of her mind into a magical calculator, could somehow temporarily separate her mind into multiple parallel threads of thought and could integrate perceptions of multiple araneas into a unified, coherent whole. And that was just the stuff he could figure out in the short time he had been given.

Considering he hasn't even done the more simple mind modifications mentioned in chapter 54, he seems to be pretty far behind when it comes to the Aranea. Maybe when he opens the secret door in the Cyorian Aranean Treasury, he'll get some useful information like integration of perceptions which could help with simulacra.

*** If the simulacrum was good enough to also be capable of memory packet creation, and if the original and the copy both carry telepathic relays, then they might be able to update each other in near-real-time, plus the simulacrum might be able to 'upload' itself back to him if it was backed into a corner and had to commit suicide.

For that matter, since the simulacrum is attached directly to his soul, can it keep functioning after his death? I guess that's the further step of becoming a lich. Hmm...if the caster of a simulacrum was killed, but then a necromancer immediately trapped their soul in a jar, /probably/ the simulacrum would continue, at least for a time.

And can a simulacrum make use of his limited-range Key detection ability?

***** Hmm. Just reread chapter 27, and it seems like yes, a lich's soul is physically located in its body - but firmly anchored to the phylactery, so in the event of disconnection from the possessed body for whatever reason, it snaps back to the anchor.

Presumably things are a little different with a simulacrum, since the soul remains in the caster. A simulacrum's connection to the soul is remote - which might, perhaps, impact on the plan to have an army of mana-assimilating simulacra replenishing your reserves almost instantaneously. On the other hand, it might still work so long as the caster (and thus the soul) remains in an area with plenty of ambient mana.

No, but see chapter 23, "Apparently there was a way to assimilate ambient mana faster if you sat completely still and focused on doing absolutely nothing else." So it ought to at least be possible for one simulacrum to do some mana meditation while Zorian is busy doing other things (or vice versa).

It's not clear whether there is a hard limit on the soul's assimilation rate, or whether having multiple attached minds would give further benefits.

********* Fair enough :). Potentially useful, but not sudden omnipotence.

Might be helpful to have one Zorian doing that while the other is in the Black Room; even at 30x time dilation, it's still better than nothing. Though I'm not sure how they'd agree on which one should do which job; one gets a day of meditation, the other gets a month cooped up with Zach, but also gets first dibs on whatever they learn inside. It probably makes more sense for the original to go inside so he can practise shaping.

Do simulacra need to eat?

EDIT: Thinking it through some more, this probably wouldn't work. First, because the Black Room is designed to isolate the inside from the outside, which is likely incompatible with the connection between simulacrum and soul; second, if the original Zorian goes inside, then his soul is in a zero-mana zone, and no amount of meditation will help. Oh well, they have crystals for that.

First, I would expect better bandwidth, and maybe better transmission fidelity, by having a simulacrum embed a memory packet. Assuming it's a high-quality simulacrum.

Second, I think it would be politically advantageous to have a simulacrum assemble whatever memories are important to it, and package them up for transfer to the next loop. He's been doing this for a bunch of friends and spiders, so it should feel relatively natural to his copy, and might ease its existential angst.

Third, whatever's in a packet, you don't forget.

My point is that with mastery of blood magic he could increase his manapool, even if it's "just" to magnitude 9 or 10, by making the ability permanetly use 1 instead of 2,3 or whatever it is using now. As he said in this chapter.

Anything that involves gathering information, rather than increasing skills, could be a candidate. So, browsing the library (including stealing a pass and getting into restricted areas), helping Kael with alchemy, investigating cultists, that kind of thing. It might be worth equipping his copies (why make only one?) with telepathic relays, so they can report on anything important or call for backup.

Yes, /but/, remember when he was attacking all those people in order to get practice reading memories, and why that was hard? How much easier will it be if they're his own memories - and will that be an effective form of practice?

There's part of me that's expecting him to keep a sub-mind for the simalcrum, as some further evolution on the memory packet, which eventually gets built up into a cheese way to both loop more people with them, and to get those people out of the loop.

AFAIK, if he can pull off full sub-mind storage and injection, then the only thing they couldn't carry out of the timeline "in" Zorian would be the soul growth (mana reserves, etc); but, "two is a silly number" - if they can get even one person out after Red Robe, stands to reason they could get two (or more).

The "end game" that comes to mind for me, is that if they need to gather a bunch of geographically dispersed bits of key (and get all of them in one turn of the loop), it would be awfully convenient to have some additional manpower to go running around the place to grab multiple bits in parallel.

Although, sharing a single Zorian-sized mana pool would be a bit of a tight constraint (unless they send out simul*Zach*ra instead)... and given he can teleport to eliminate travel time, it's not necessarily possible to get very much of an advantage by having simulacra get individually "into position" before doing the mana intensive bits in sequence.

Unless of course they're able to devise low-mana strategies for obtaining the MacGuffins, in which case we're back to potentially sending out an army of Zorian clones.

I'm thinking the opposite. I had never considered (or heard of) this theory before now, and this chapter made it feel as if it was being hammered into my head.

I think the reason for Zach's large mana reserves is because he had/has a long-term simulacrum using his mana. Note how he mentions that he has exactly twice the mana his shaping skills would suggest.

Also, note that since Red Robe has no soul of his own, the search spell Zorian cast would naturally only find Zach.

I don't think there's any doubt Zach would summon a long-term simulacrum - he clearly hadn't considered the dangers this time around, he wouldn't do so before. And the soul/looping issue is something he would have to solve in order to make a truly long-term companion for his looping, anyway.

I'm now thinking it very likely indeed that Red Robe is Zach's simulacrum that wiped his memory. Though questions as to the exact mechanisms of how it intends to escape the time loop remain, of course.

His reaction might be that both people should find a way out. But if one of those people were a simulacrum, my guess is most people would probably not value the "right to life" of the simulacrum.

Red Robe as Zac's simulacrum is a possibility if there is some way to get a semblance of a soul. I still feel simulacrum!Zac would be pretty genial, but it's possible he might have, for example, incorporated the soul of Veyers somehow, leaving him somehow unhinged.

The main issue is that simulacrum!Zac has only one loop to get a soul and a marker. However, the original looper can add people to the loop, and would know the other functions of the Sovereign Gate. This knowledge might have been enough to allow simulacrum!Zac to make himself a looper.

- Zac creates a simulacrum.
- Zac and Simulacrum find him a soul somehow.
- Simulacrum marks its soul for temporary looping.
- Simulcarum makes the mark permanent.

With Zac's prestige and power, simulacrum!Zac may have been able to swing all this.

*** There are a few ways I could see a time-looping simulacrum, and after this chapter I'm back to thinking that is what's going on. It depends on stuff like how hard it is to change your "starting point" in the loop (Zach's real body is touching the Gate but his loop-self wakes up in bed, so it's possible), if simulacrums have read-write access to the shared soul, how hard it is to duplicate a soul and other minor quirks of how the Gate handles edge cases.

But the real important stuff here is the information about simulacrum being half of what's needed to become a lich. Between that, comments made about spirits and the one time we've seen a simulacrum burst, I'm pretty sure you can transfer your soul into one, effectively making it your "prime body" instead of having it be a spin-off self. So long as Zorian can reach the point where he can cast simulacrum as a soul (thanks to endless shaping exercises) and keep his soul from passing on for a few seconds (not yet, but with further out-of-body practise...) he has a solution to his lack of a body when escaping the time loop.

But even if he is, the loop mechanics imply nothing of the sort. The only thing we can reasonably assume is that realworld!Zach (if he is indeed the original gate user) has a marker on his soul and that /someone/ activated the Gate and we know there are some agents (angels, most likely) that have that power. As for the looper, nothing is needed besides the marker itself.

Unlike any other cases, the simulacrum has /exactly/ one month to and one attempt to rebel, subdue Zach, /craft himself a soul/ and get himself a copy marker, then erase Zach's soul magic skills (remember, Zach /can not/ cast the spell, he'll need more lessons from Alanic). That's just too complex for my taste.

The competing theory that Zach being a careless goof that he is, told a high ranking cultist about time loop and paid dearly for it is much simpler. Cultists are necromancers check, cultists dabble in mind magic check (the want to subdue a primordial!), cultists are in secret high ranking officials check, Zach told multiple higher ups about the invasion check.

  In fact, [Zorian's magic missile] was so mana-efficient at this point that it was playing merry hell with his ability to judge how far his mana reserves had grown. He could cast about 35 of them in quick succession, which was more than four times the amount he could cast before the time loop -- that shouldn't be possible, especially since he was sure his mana reserves still hadn't topped out yet, so the most logical conclusion was that his magic missiles required significantly less mana now than they had in the past.
#+end_quote

I noted the flawed logic ("I can cast 4× more MM than I could, therefore they must be 4× more efficient than they were") and assumed that at least part of the disparity was from an increase in mana capacity.

I don't recall the story contradicting that in later chapters---it largely veered away from hard numbers about his capacity---but I admit that I'd forgotten my initial reasoning for my conclusion, which led to me thinking it was justified in the text itself.

Frankly, if there is such an extraordinary variance in the efficiency of magic missile then its use as a basis for an objective ranking for capacity is minimal, as Zorian himself noted. If that's truly the best method then we can't be sure that Zach is magnitude 50 either; though his missiles are at the very least far less efficient than Zorian's, they may still be more efficient than the average mage (and the fact that shaping skills, tied indirectly to efficiency, are related to capacity further compounds the issue).

Hang on, can a /simulacrum/ do that? It's linked to the same soul, and has essentially the same skills, so I would think it can?

And...we know that there is a running mana cost to maintain a simulacrum, but we also know that it's not large, because it's possible (however inadvisable) to maintain a simulacrum for days. Whereas a mage in Cyoria can fill up his/her reserves in a few hours, even less with concentration and the right technique (which Xvim taught to Zorian).

So a simulacrum in an area with plenty of ambient mana could in theory represent a net mana /gain/...which means that the only obstacle to using multiple simulacra would be the politics...and with enough of them, you could assimilate ambient mana as fast as you could expend it...

Am I missing something here?

3. If they have enough mana to get two or more keys simultaneously, then great. Otherwise, they do short rests in between attempts, allowing for each person's soul to regenerate to full. It would still allow them to get all the keys in one day and with minimal rests due to casting teleport five times.

Or for powers (like soul sight) that you're able to copy from others, but wouldn't know how to cast as regular spells. Clearly the Noveda bloodline, if it exists, is not a regular enhancement, since it massively increases mana reserves rather than tying them up.

Incidentally, if it is indeed feasible to copy bloodline powers through blood magic, then that bloodline would be amazingly valuable to any blood mage. They wouldn't even necessarily have to be evil; I'm sure there are non-fatal ways to use blood magic on a willing target.

**** Interesting theory, but I don't think it can explain Zach's reserves adequately.

Zach told Zorian he can cast 232 magic missiles before he runs out. That's pretty specific, not just a guess. Therefore he has tested it.

Now, according to your theory, he was rapidly regenerating mana during the test, throwing off the results. However, if he was concentrating on casting magic missile, then that regeneration would just be the passive soul-generates-mana-from-nothing, not assimilating ambient mana. According to the latest world-building post, that normally takes about nine hours, so our enhanced Zach would take 4.5 hours.

How long is the test? We know he can cast it reflexively, and presumably he tested after reaching that level of proficiency. Let's generously assume he casts every five seconds (it's probably much faster, not even counting swarms). At that rate, he takes just under 20 minutes to cast 232 missiles and exhaust himself. Not nearly enough time for his regeneration to give the impression that his reserves were twice as big as they really are. He would need to regenerate as if he were /over magnitude 600/ to throw his test results out that far.

If the souls are combined, it neatly explains Zach's comment about his actual natural reserves (50 magnitude) vs his natural shaping skills (25 magnitude) this chapter.

If Zach is anything like Zorian, he probably didn't have a good grasp on the size of his reserves before this year. Zorian was a better student, and he didn't seem that aware of what his natural reserves were, or how the maximum increases after years of usage. So I don't think Zach actually knew what his reserves were before the loop. He's not particularly clear about it in his conversation with Zorian this chapter.

Why would it be a proportional system? If it's used to sustain it then it should just be however much mana it needs so that Zach could get lots of enhancements.

Also the whole blood line thing, why not once you're old or about to have kids if you're a woman, enchant your blood line to the max (diminishing returns means you'll always have some mana left anyway 10% of 10% of 10%... is never zero) and then have a bunch of kids? And then those kids do the same thing.

Unless the mana limit applies to kids too.

Also if demons just value life force why not use non sapient or evil magical creatures in the summoning rituals, or stock up your life force like you'd give blood. You could carry life force crystals like mana crystals no?

Also the simulacrum sounds incredibly dangerous. Would you be ok being bossed around by someone who claimed to be yourself? You know you're the real version, but this other person who looks like you is telling you to do what they say. Alaric's right and makes me really surprised it works with Liches because who is more independent than Liches. You really need a real desire to kill yourself to save yourself. Since every simulacrum knows their life is forfeit from the moment they're born. They won't get the pleasure of knowing that they will revive in another time loop.

***** I am pretty sure the narration was translating the issue into amounts relative to his mana pool because we haven't seen absolute quantities for mana costs the way e.g. /The Waves Arisen/ has.

Furthermore, that segment comes on the heels of this:

#+begin_quote
  Every magical creature needed a certain amount of ambient mana just to stay alive and fuel their magical abilities. The more powerful they were, the higher the ambient mana levels had to be to support them. Stepping into an area too thin in ambient mana to support them wouldn't immediately kill them, but they would find themselves quickly weakening and wasting away. This was the main reason why powerful monsters from the deeper levels of the Dungeon didn't overrun everything -- they would effectively starve to death outside their home areas.

  A human, regardless of the manner in which they acquired their magical abilities, also had to pay the price to maintain their existence. A portion of their mana reserves was effectively lost, permanently tied down in the maintenance of the magical enhancement. Their mana reserves maximum would be permanently lowered.
#+end_quote

The cost for magical creatures is flat. The cost for humans is explicitly compared to that. So I read the cost for humans to maintain enhancements as also being flat, just subtracted from their mana cap, and depending on how large your mana cap /is/, that could range from a minor annoyance to a massive hobble. Since Zorian has below-average mana cap, he's interested in eking as much efficiency out of the ritual as possible.

Of course it does. The reason for the mana cost is because the abilities need mana to function. If you expend all of your mana reserves on abilities, you've effectively given up all possibility of generic spellcasting in favor of a fixed set of abilities.

Of course, there are two situations I can think of which would allow Red Robe easy access to a red robe. The first being a red robe guarded by wards that Red Robe had previously learned how to disarm effortlessly (the owner of the robe is away) and the second being an inner cult member who was erased from the template (like the Cyorian Aranea) which would allow for easy access to a "soul killed" body donning red robes.

** Fantastic chapter, as always.

Red Robe being Zach's simulacrum and possibly wearing Veyers' body sounds spot on to me, a great theory. It does raise some questions, though. For instance, Red Robe actually knows the Simulacrum spell:

#+begin_quote
  For a moment, the matriarch was afraid that they had killed the man, making all her preparations and plotting meaningless... but the reality turned out to be far worse than that. Instead of erupting into a shower of blood and gore, the robed man simply... turned into smoke.

  The opponent they had been fighting hadn't been the third time traveler in person. It had been merely an ectoplasmic shell infused with some of his skill and magic. A simulacrum, meant to test the waters and distract them.
#+end_quote

And the simulacrum seems willing to die for him. Plot hole or clue? If Red Robe was a rebellious simulacrum, surely his own simulacra wouldn't be terribly obedient? Has RR also learned how to control them? Also, Zorian remembers Zach being chill even before the loop. Red Robe is, to put it mildly, somewhat of a dick. Did SZach just freak, like Alrick said they sometimes do, when he realized he's a simulacrum? The freak-out, combined with having to do whatever fucked-up shit he did to save himself beyond the loop reset and to wipe Zach's memory, would have pushed him along a darker path. Also, like Zach, Red Robe seems talented in many ways, but not that... clever. He bought the arenea misdirection hook, line and sinker, and then just brute forced his way through the problem.

I also have some general thoughts about the story far. (Notice me, senpai!!!) Personally, I am looking forward to Z&Z investigating the lesser markers and the expel from loop spell further.

Expel's utility is obvious - they're going to have a hard time reliably getting all of the pieces of the Key without it. For example, getting Quatach-Ichl's piece. First few loops, assaults on him, trying to hit him with the expel spell. (Speaking of which, has the expel spell been shown to be blocked by magical defenses and wards or, since it's kind of an higher-level admin tool, if you're hit you're done?) The next few loops after that, an assault on wherever his remains are at the start of the loop and expelling whatever resistance there might be in the location. Every loop after that - wake up, teleport, grab it, check mark on the list, go grab a coffee.

And the lesser markers would be crucial in arranging this. Getting Xvim and Alrick in on it for multiple loops at a time would save Z&Z days of getting them to believe them and weeks of getting them up to speed and getting them to fully trust them. As for the ethics of it, well, they've already told them that they are copies of themselves who get wiped out once a month and that's like 90% of it. Personally, I think if I was made aware of being in someone else's time loop, I'd prefer to have six months over one. Xvim and Alrick seem like the tough, old, responsible bastards who, if asked, would agree to it for the cause. I wouldn't use it on the rest of Z&Z's close circle, though. That would suck.

You don't need to expel them at the start of the month. Zorian had already spent a month hunting them in the caverns before. Next month, most of them immediately flop down, aranea-style, they're probably reinforced, a few more purges like that and investigating the gate might work. But QI needs to get expelled first.

And, again, the alternative is fighting them all anyway, but at the end of the month, when they're in full combat mode and with hours left on the timer.

I'm not saying it's easy. I'm saying the other options suck a lot more. At least, using the tools we know of so far. I mean, sure, they could find a "bitch slap QI to death reliably and with ease any time they want" spell, then they can just do that. But that would... not be amazing storytelling.

Ugh. I conflated the bit about magically enhanced beings needed ambient mana (or reserves) to survive with the simulacrum. I should have gone back to double check before posting--my bad.

I knew the simulacrum had to draw from the caster's mana pool to cast spells, but thought I had read that they could absorb ambien mana to pay for their upkeep, and possibly spells.

Now I'm not sure they can use ambient mana at all. You might /need/ a soul to do that. Well, to share with a human anyway. People can't just use ambient mana--absorbing it without converting it first is harmful.

/However/, I'm pretty sure Zorian has created devices that cast using stored reserves of ambient mana. They /could/ have used crystallized mana, but I thought there were ones that basically just had a storage chamber of some sort.

He used them for defense in one of the invasions of Cyoria, IIRC, but I'm not terribly confident in my memory after my earlier mistake. I'll re-read to look for it after Finals week, I guess.

** So... this seems to me like an anomaly.

It's clear that in MoL-verse, minds and souls have separate existences. You can have mindless undead powered by enslaved souls; Alanic had to create a magical brain in order for Zorian to retain self-awareness while disembodied; and now we've established that you can have multiple independent minds attached to the same soul.

So.../how does the Gate maintain continuity of the Controllers' minds/, if all it retains is the soul? (Remember that the Guardian didn't seem to have any awareness of Red Robe as an individual; it only pays attention to the soul marker.)

Is it simply because their souls contain all of their memories, so they're actually newly-created minds, but running on all the old data? If so, then why aren't simulacrum memories likewise imprinted on the soul? The author has explicitly stated that simulacra are /not/ automatically reintegrated with the caster; but if the soul contains a record of everything the attached mind has experienced, how can that be true?

Especially since we are told that simulacra resemble liches, and surely when a lich's magical brain is destroyed, and its soul snaps back to the phylactery, it will remember what happened to that brain.

*** It makes more sense if you think of things in terms of programming, particularly in terms of scope and controlling mutability. What that means is that some spells create a mind that can write information onto the soul, whereas others do not.

*Magic Brain (a la Alanic)*

This spell is specifically designed to create a single mind that can write information to the soul. Alanic had to cast the spell in such an isolated environment---indeed, even isolated from light---and this spell may be one reason why. This would mean the spell is very difficult, dangerous, and fragile.

*Simulacrum*

(We know that simulacra share mana, but not memories, so their mechanism is likely different. This may be because mana is more or less a binary thing---do you have enough or don't you---whereas memories are more complicated. This discussion is aimed at how memory information is dealt with rather than mana information.)

Simulacrum is designed to work with at least two concurrent minds. The mind reads and writes information to the soul. With two minds, this back and forth process can get complicated and may create conflicts. (This is a headache familiar to programmers who program for multiple cores when they allow for mutability.)

For example, what if one mind improves shaping and the other mind improves mana capacity (which limits shaping ability) and then the soul tries to read that information? The result would be a conflict. One solution is a complicated set of rules, perhaps with bugs or loopholes, for how and when to mutate information from the minds. Another solution which eliminates /all/ of that complexity is to not have the simulacrum change the soul at all.

Also, taking into account the magic brain spell Alanic used, there may be a source of difficulty other than the information safety problems I mentioned above. It may simply be very hard to make a mind that can has write access to the soul, and that's why Alanic needed a special ritual that was isolated from the rest of the world. Those kinds of connections may be more delicate, which might limit the usefulness of a simulacrum spell.

Aside: Alanic said that half of becoming a lich is learning the simulacrum spell. In other words, it's a spell that allows the user to give a separate brain access to your soul's mana pool. Perhaps another piece of the puzzle for the lich ritual involves giving that mind access to the soul's information storage as well. I would guess there is a lot of additional modification to the spells that needs to be done as well . . .

The other issue with the simulacrum having continuous read/write access to the soul is that the minds of both the caster and their simulacrum would have to deal with two sets of sensory input. If memory serves me, even Zorian struggles to actively control of his own body /and/ get sensory input from another body. Usually, he has to concentrate to see through the eyes of another being and he able to use mind magic to filter the information. If both a caster and their simulacrum were getting straight information dumps, it might be harder to focus, which would make the spell more difficult to use.

It would still be nice to get an information dump when a simulacrum passed away, and that might be a possible modification of the spell (I can see that feature being important to a lich), but that would also be a dangerous feature. Say you're in a battle and your simulacrum is eviscerated and you suddenly get a day's worth of memories plus a ton of pain dumped into your brain. The distraction might give the enemy the chance to kill you.

*The Gate*

I'm guessing the Gate creates a normal connection between the souls it creates and the minds they work with. Souls that are marked get shunted into the new pocket universe and are connected to the new mind. When the Gate finally deactivates, the soul is reconnected with the original mind.

I wonder if [[/u/nobody103]] has any insights he can divulge at this point in the story . . .

Read-only Access: In reality, it doesn't have read-access---it's just duplicating the caster's mind and the information contained therein at the time of casting. In other words, it's second-hand read-access.

Memory Updating: I think that if sensory input from the simulacrum are converted to memories in its magic brain then transferred to the soul, this would update the sensory input for the original caster. I can see what you're saying, but I feel you'd need a filter to prevent the simulacrum's sensory input from arriving continuously in the caster's mind.

Either way, we know from the story that the simulacrum spell copies the mind at the time of casting and does not at any time transfer mnemonic information to the soul.

When programming and you make a copy of something, it's useful to be able to modify that copy and not have the original also change (call-by-value). You can have the copy point to the original as well (call-by-reference), but it can create issues. Both have their place, and I wouldn't be surprised if the lich ritual involves modifying the simulacrum spell to work like a call-by-reference.
