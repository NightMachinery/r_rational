Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** (Names not final. Just needed some because people laugh when they see someone named Firstname Lastname or a planet named Planet1, Planet2)

Tentative Name: Worlds Collide

Currently the planets Yuna and Wildis are occupying the same space, which is possible by space tech magic (make up better sounding thing, for now just call it planetary phase shifter) but only for a little while longer. Certain times each planet sees the ghostly overlay of the other. Shift gates have been setup to help communicate between worlds to solve this issue. There also small experimental watch size individual phase shifters. Satellite connections are intermittent, tides are effected, nothing can exit the atmorsphere. Wildis's two moon may or may not also be phasing in. This situation has been dubbed the Merge by the inhabitants of the two worlds. Current best proposed solution is to rotate Wildis 1/4 turn and only phase the crust and outwards in, or some variation of this plan. Due to how the continents are distibuted, this would prevent any land mass overlap, but will still cause oceanic disruption, climate change, etc.

Yuna

The high tech planet. The stationary planet involved in what has been dubbed The Merge.

Secrets

Has a mostly friendly AI (working name Prometheus) that is working towards solving the Merge problem, and puts out the quests it needs done through through different organizations secretly. Many of the quests the characters do end up being for the Prometheus AI, even if they don't know it.

Wildis

Prehistoric planet involved in what has been dubbed The Merge. Phase was triggered on purpose by the last remnants of formally space faring races on this prehistoric planet. Their univers was being swallowed by a massive black hole, and this was the farthest habitable planet they could reach from their respective sectors. They have some designs, blueprints, knowledge from their former universe. This shift got them away from a super massive black hole in their dimension, but some calculation was off. The odds of phasing into another planet are supposed to be low, but here it is happening anyway...

General Background

Standard D&D races involved, but each race is only found on one of the planet previous to the Merge. Magic started appearing when the Merge started happening. The Warforged are known to be the creation/children of the Prometheus AI that turned into a wizard when the Merge started.

Speculated Background

Wildis appears to be Yuna that dodged an asteroid impact in the distant pass from alternate dimension. Continents still in a super continent, but all the landmasses on Yuna could fit into roughly the same shape. Would explain the orbit and planet size being almost exact matches.

Secret Background This is designed to be a game campaign. The first time a player dies (have to watch the challenge rating while the characters are weak), it will be revealed they are in a simulation and they can roll back to before the last major confrontation. Knowledge is kept but items are lost. The characters are told that their whole world is a simulation and meet the Olympus Research Group (or their avatars) that explain that they want the characters and inhabitants to solve the puzzle or they will have to regenerate new npcs. If they can solve the problem, they can guarantee they will leave the simulation running for at least 5000 subjective years from the point of view of the simulation without further interference. Any new technology developed will lead to longer uptime of the simulation. The Deities that people believe in did mostly actually exist, but they were avatars of the Olympus Research Group. This suggests but isn't explicitly stated that the simulation is on a much faster subjective time.

Olympus Research Group:

Carl Ronos - Project Lead/ CEO?

Herold Ades - Lead Developer (Life Generation Algorithms)

Peter Oeisodon - Lead Developer (Physics Engine)

Zack Eus - Lead Developer (Story Scripting and Event Generation Engine)

- others

Possible Side quests (not tied to main story line)

Dinosaur/ prehistoric animal retrieval for study and genetic samples

Forge alliances between specific races

Be a magic researcher and learn what magic is/ create magic items. (may require random components)

There is more background and stuff floating around in my head as ideas. This would allow a campaign to have everything from dinosaurs to high tech AI to magic. Big thoughts: Once the characters realize that they are simulation/programs, how will it change their interaction with the Prometheus AI? I would appreciate any critiques or worldbuilding ideas.

*** I feel like as a player, finding out it's all a simulation would be disappointing. Also, I would have a hard time being convinced that simulating two entire planets is going to be the most efficient way to solve any interesting problems, unless the simulation highly resembles the real world, or is some sort of prediction. The AI quests sounds cool though.

**** Thank you for your feedback. I will consider if it being a simulation will detract more than it adds. It could be that this is happening to a real planet elsewhere and they are using this to get more time to solve the problem in the real universe, since simulations could have more subjective time than reality to come up with possible approaches.

*** Hmmm.

Some thoughts:

- Simulation hypothesis would seem to cheapen the player's choices. Doesn't matter what they do, if they anger the Lead Scientist it gets instantly rewound. This messes with player agency and... may cause problems. (Also, if the Lead Scientists have AI - which they must in order for Prometheus to exist in the sim - then isn't it a better idea to use that computing hardware for a team of dedicated AI Thinkers to figure out a solution to the problem, instead of simulating an entire world?)

- Interphase interactions could be interesting. Presumably the biggest dinosaurs are nearly unique to Wildis, since phase gates can only be made so large (but some people will bring eggs over from one side to the other and try to raise them).

- I can imagine a magic device - "Phase Goggles" - that lets you see what's happening in the other phase at any time (but not interact beyond that). A scientist planning a risky experiment might use phase goggles to inspect it from the other world, while a spy might use phase goggles (accompanied by either phase headphones or an ability to lipread) to spy on a secret meeting.

- One way to prevent a meeting from being spied on by an out-of-phase spy is to hold it in a basement or near the top of a high-rise building, where there is no building in the other world. However, spells like "Fly" or one that allows moving through rock make those precautions tricky to use successfully.

- A better way is to have people guarding the other phase of the same location as the secret meeting. On top of that, a small percentage of guards (in both phases) have their own phase goggles (and a communication protocol based on hand signs) so as to keep in contact with each other.

- If two people stand in different phases such that their brains overlap, is telepathy between them possible? If so, would it be voluntary?

**** The phase goggles is a neat idea. If this makes it to campaign, I don't want the players to feel their actions don't matter, so the simulation will probably get pulled. I think there is still enough hook and possibilities without it, just have the AI quest chain be more important. The Olympus Research Group could just be researchers stranded in space on their space station and the Greek pantheon references are just a red herring to make them think they are more important. It wasn't the original intent, but the guard procedures would be like the Long Earth series (people could step from one Earth to the next in an ?infinite? chain of Earths). Meetings are held in special bunkers that don't have a corresponding underground location, and you could definitely employ guards/counter-intelligence agents on both sides. Thank you for your critique and contribution
