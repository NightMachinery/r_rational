** This is about the writing process for the story, and contains nothing new on the plot end. I'm just...thinking aloud here.

HSTW has some similarities to r!Animorphs, in that I might have a general idea of how things are /likely/ to go, given the present state of things, but I don't actually /know/. The primary reason for this is the size of the cast: there are more than a hundred moving parts in this story and while some of them will only appear on screen for a single chapter (or might never appear, for that matter), they can still have an immense influence on the course of the story.

Meifeng Wu is an example of this. When I first thought of her, it quickly became apparent what Giathi and Takitini were going to do with her. With her at the helm of their operations, China would, as one of you have said, /industrialize/, and the situation in Asia would turn very, very interesting.

Then I realized that, you know, everyone is the main character of their own story, and maybe I should take a second look at how Mister Bao would handle the situation that he had found himself in, and that's thrown events wildly off course from my original projections.

It worries me a little, because I can't guarantee a satisfying ending on account of how, every other month, everything that I know about that ending changes. When I first started working on this story, years ago, Viejo didn't die like she did a couple of chapters ago and this interrogation never happened. I didn't plan for Meifeng to be dead so early, either, but so it goes.

On the other hand, the situation is the same in r!Animorphs. Whether the Yeerk invasion succeeds or fails, and at what cost, is still up in the air so far as the story's author knows, and that doesn't seem to be posing a problem for anyone. So I have some hope that HSTW will work out.

I do want to make this explicit though. I've previously mentioned that HSTW is an experiment and that the characters sometimes send things off the rails, but I know that the story has picked up some readers since then and I'd hate to find out that they missed those comments.

(And if you haven't read r!Animorphs then you really ought to do so.)
