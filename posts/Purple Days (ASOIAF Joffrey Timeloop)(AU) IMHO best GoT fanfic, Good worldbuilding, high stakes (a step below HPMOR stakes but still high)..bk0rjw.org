** I generally like this story, but I'd advise people to wait until it's finished if you haven't picked it up yet.

The story just has some nice worldbuilding and characters, but it's 640k words long and the pacing is off. It feels like the story was 50% written at 600k, then realized that it had to finish the other 50% by 700k.

It's still a recommend for me, but there's a probably high chance of it going off the rails.

** I liked this one a lot. The early chapters (after the prologue) are a bit of a slog, because Joffrey starts the fanfic as his charming canon self, and reading about his stupidities gets old really fast. But around chapter 7 he gets hit with character development after the reality of his situation sinks in and he hits rock bottom, and that's when he starts to become the likable protagonist he will remain throughout the rest of the story. I particularly enjoyed the Yi-Ti arc, though the TVTropes page [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/PurpleDays][says]] a lot of people thought it went on for too long.

The awesomeness reaches a climax when Joffrey finds out the true nature of his curse and its relationship to the White Walkers. Unfortunately, shortly after that the fic adds another looper, and I didn't find the second looper nearly as interesting as the first, so my interest waned and that's when I dropped the story. Maybe I'll come back to it later, after it has progressed a bit more.

In terms of rationality, I'm not sure it's a good fit for this sub. The characters are all [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][level 1 intelligent]], and there aren't any blatant plot holes or incoherent worldbuilding, but the same is true of the source material so it doesn't count as a deconstruction. The mysteries are not particularly solvable in advance by the reader, Joeffrey gets a lot of help from The Powers That Be, and he doesn't display any unusual cognitive techniques or scientific knowledge. On the other hand, the sub needs content, so we can probably let it slide.

** The prose is very stilted and awkward. Numerous grammatical mistakes, dialogue doesn't sound natural, inner monologues are awkward, suffers from the 'look how cool, but angsty and tortured but also so strong my protagonist is' syndrome. Justified somewhat by the concept, but seeing the near-end state of the loop is a terrible mistake to start with. You need to build to that, not keep forward. It's a payoff without a buildup. Author has to 'earn'that Joffrey. This is based only off of my reading of the prologue. I'm planning to give it 1-2 chapters to change my mind, but it's pretty bad so far.

**** So it has the same problems at least through chapter 7, but the author effectively builds on the concept and handles Joffrey as he is, and doesn't shift his character too far forward in each loop. I've been converted somewhat as it continues. Joffrey's derangement is interesting to read.

******* If you don't read the story, you don't care. So spoilers are only an issue if you read the story. The point of the search would be to locate a point in the story where the spelling quality (which is easily evaluated) is sufficient to be engaged with. This method is probably preferable to "just skip to the latest chapter", as it probably provides less spoilers. (The amount of spoilers a chapter may have, increases with the chapter number, so the latest chapter has the most spoilers. 1/2 way through should only have half as much.) Additionally, significant spoilers are not guaranteed. You're not reading the chapter, just evaluating spelling/etc. quality.

In fact, with the way the story has progressed thus far, it has also been rendered obsolete in terms of content too (many of the plot points not having been explored the way they were implied to have been in the prologue.\\
IMO, scrapping it entirely would probably be ideal (instead of leaving it in as a 'teaser' of what is to coe) as the readers are very much /meant/ to dislike Joffrey at the beginning and let the story the follows try to persuade you otherwise.
