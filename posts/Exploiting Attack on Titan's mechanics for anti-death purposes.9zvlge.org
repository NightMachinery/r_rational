Spoilers; I believe the anime has covered most of this by now but I haven't been keeping up.

​

Titans are basically giant braindead zombies that have a near-unlimited healing factor and don't need food, freely ignoring several laws of physics. (Some) humans can be turned into titans. They can then be turned back into humans by eating one of the 7 Unique Titans, at which point they can freely shapeshift into the Unique they ate and inherit its properties, but will die after 13 years. While in the mindless titan state, humans don't age (Ymir was a titan for decades before returning to human state), though they seem to experience a prolonged unpleasant dream. Turning a human into a titan and back will grant a healing factor that brings a character back from the brink of death; this process is used for emergency medical purposes at one point.

Seems exploitable, but tricky. Healing, stasis, etc, but you have to have the patient kill a Unique to return to human form and there can only ever be 7 active at the same time, and then the patient will die after 13 years. Currently the setting seems to be ontologically magical, so we should assume that trying to trick the core rules wouldn't work (ingesting spinal fluid seems to be the mechanism for transferring the titan and Unique Titan characteristic, but presumably the Unique has to die in the transfer because the obvious exploits would surely have been tried in-universe).

Stasis via turning people into mindless titans is the easy step: there's no limit to how much you can do this, and they can be stored indefinitely since they're indestructible and don't really do much unless humans are nearby. Toss any number of them on an island that DOESN'T have a walled country in the middle and you're good to go, technically nobody dies.

The tricky part is getting them back out, since you can only bring out 7 at a time and they only live for 13 years (plus whoever you revive gets some bullshit superpowers, massive security issue). One option is to just keep titanizing everyone who dies until medical technology advances to the point that you don't need to anymore, at which point you slowly restore the backlog of titans and let them live 13 years more than they would have, over a looooong timeframe. Not amazing.

Best exploit I can see is to titanize the dying until there's a technology that lets the humans who have the Unique titan powers persist in some way after being eaten; brain upload, clone and brain transplant in such a way that doesn't violate the magical rule system, etc etc. Then no matter how many titans are in storage when the tech is discovered, they can be restored at a much higher rate than 7 every 13 years.

Let me know what cheeky LW-cheese you find in this setting.

** Not needing to eat + predictable behavior + wanting to eat humans = free energy. Any design which harnesses zombies for power should work with titans scaled up with sufficiently durable materials assuming no hostile special titans (which gives the series an excuse, sort of). But you only really need a few titans in a secure facility to produce a lot of power, which isn't a huge security risk. You can have it underground for more special titan security or outside the walls for better scalability

*** Not to spoil, I'll just say this works and has been done in that universe, even easier than that because one of the unique titans can control regular titans.

** I thought titans became more active during the day compared to night time or something. This probably suggests that they get their energy from the sun or something.

** With their technology and population, it seems pretty hard to exploit this mechanic. But its true, you can get infinite flesh aka mass from these titans, free energy? You could also build a hamster wheel type structure which you can get energy from. Using wild titans seems hard but human hybrids can be exploited in many ways because of their size-changing nature, they could be transformed in an enclosure(underground?) which only has a human-sized exit, once you have them there im sure they can be used in one way or another.

I don't think titans can walk under the sea but its possible, they already ignore so many laws.

*** Titan mass is destroyed when severed from the titan. The only exception to this is the titan crystal, which only shifters can use at will. (Or titans with the capability given the directive by the Coordinate power, as seen with the walls.) You could use this for building really fast, but not much else. The only other thing I think is viable is using the heat given off by their regeneration as a source of energy, or just harnessing the colossal titan's steam release ability. Those both have resource costs (wasting the materials that can damage titan skin, building a colossal titan sized steam plant, etc.)

**** You could probably burn their bodymass if you're fast, only reason that wouldn't work is the setting's magic. There are a bajillion ways to get free energy out of them, though.

***** Depending on how fast the mass disappears, you can still build a crude (and morbid) purely mechanical perpetual motion machine. Drop into a wheel repeatedly severed titan limbs, and as long you can get more energy out than it takes to cut the flesh, you can drive the blade off the same device, and collect the difference as output.

** Just a few things: there are 9 unique titan shifters, not 7. Mindless titans need at least some amount of solar energy to operate, even though the amount required isn't the same from one individual to another, so it's not like they produce energy out of nowhere. Also, while the mechanism of "eating a shifter to become one" has been covered in the anime, the 13y curse and 9 unique shifters are not yet revealed so be careful with spoilers.\\
Other than that, very interesting ideas.

** Attack on Titan has the most inconsistent universe. Most of the rules about how Titans work are designed for maximum drama, and clear that they never thought of them when the earlier episodes were being written.

I'm sure if the humans ever figured out a way to harness energy from a Titan, a magical teleporting titan would show up just to smash it all and disappear again.

*** I agree about the inconsistency of it all. One of the biggest plot holes is that it's once stated that the Titans are really low density and light (which I suppose is sort of meant to obviate the fact that this mass is created from nowhere? Perhaps we should really believe it's just condensed sunlight?), but then when they attack they totally seem massive and cause comparable damage. If they really were light they could be knocked over with no effort by all the cannonballs they instead tank without a problem.

#+begin_quote
  the obvious exploits would surely have been tried

Or there could be surprise effects - half the power may be transferred, but then both live for 6.5 years (or less) instead of 13, etc.
