** I'm currently rereading the whole story since I need to remember everything that happened so I haven't left a review on the latest chapters. I forgot how good this shit is since it's been quite a long time.

Thanks for continuing to update the story, I was actually hoping the other day you'd continue the story then out of nowhere you updated literally within day or two lol.

I just finished rereading the Wave arc (on chapter 19) and something about the way you convey fights is just awesome. You do it in a manner that isn't drawn out, fast and quick actions while still showing the character's on the fly thoughts and reasoning for what they're doing in that moment. It really seems like how an actual ninja fight will go down.

*** Cheers, I'm glad you like it.

I actually think the fights in Naruto are one of the best aspects of the manga. Sure, some of it is just boring power-up nonsense, but what sets it apart from other shonen like Bleach is that there's a whole established combat system. This makes it amazing for fanfiction since you can have characters pull off clever tricks using already established rules without it feeling like an asspull.

Almost all Naruto fanfiction completely wastes this opportunity. Even the stories that are liked around here have combat scenes where you just have two characters punching each other and then the writer decides that one of them gets a hit in and they win. It's completely devoid of tension because the outcome is so arbitrary. Besides, there is simply no reason why two ninjas would ever fight hand-to-hand for more than 2 seconds, because one of them always has a comparative advantage to doing something else instead. Why fight on your opponent's terms if you can fight on your own?

The way I write combat scenes in NTBS, I start by writing down each of the character's abilities (where things like "superior weapon skill" counts as just one ability), and then see how these abilities match up against each other. I ask myself "What would be my opening move if I were this character? What would I expect my opponent to do? How would I counter that?" I go through countless iterations before I finally settle on a script that makes sense.

The other driving philosophy behind my combat scenes is the idea that one hit is lethal. In regular Naruto fanfiction, people always get little cuts from knives and such to try and drive up the tension, but this actually achieves the opposite effect: The reader doesn't worry if their characters get hit because they always survive it. In NTBS, all characters are trained to assume that all weapons are poisoned. This also means that ninjas don't just randomly taunt each other during fights - they're fucking terrified of getting hit even once. And the reader feels that terror in them, I think, and it adds to the tension.

All of that is just a long way of saying that I'm really proud of my combat scenes, so I'm glad you like them. :)

**** You're rightfully proud of your combat scenes. You put so much thought and work into them and it shows. I like your philosophy on being hit and taking damage. You ever noticed some stories will have characters being thrown through fully healthy trees and yet somehow the character takes it as if they just bursted through a thin wooden plank? Even though characters can achieve amazing "supernatural" feats, I've always felt like despite that I'd take a more grounded approach to damage if I wrote a story. Trees are infinitely more sturdy than fiction as a whole gives them credit for. While they can breathe fire and do all sorts of crazy stuff they're still humans. I view ninjas as glass cannons (besides the few exceptions who can seriously tank damage).

Naruto absolutely has my favorite power system of any media. I'm always fascinated by the interworking of chakra and the dynamics of fights as a whole. I enjoy seeing the jutsu's writers come up with just as much as the actual story itself. Chakra is just so intricate and layered in what it can do. You can achieve endless creativity when it comes to creating techniques because of all the systems. Nature manipulation and how chakra natures interact with each other, shape manipulation, the actual chakra system and itself and the way it flows through the body with chakra points, how it's molded, the way Yin and Yang work, how you have Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and Taijutsu and how they can be used in conjunction with one another, etc. It's one of the reasons I think Naruto is such a popular series to write fanfiction for.

I always ask myself when I see magic in a form of media: what dictates that this particular maguc spell is a flaming dragon head that shoots fire? You never know, it just /is/. Which is fine, but with Naruto you actually have systems at play which you can use to explain why. Yin is the spiritual side in which you gave the shape of the dragon, Yang breathes life into the form and so on.

I've always used DBZ's ki as a comparison. I'll love DBZ until I die but ki is just so one dimensional in how it works. DBZ's fighting system basically devolves into who has the strongest power output. With chakra there's SO many other factors at play which lends itself to far more strategy. One characters abilities may counter another characters abilities. Just because A beats B and B beats C doesn't mean A beats C you know? I've always felt like even though Sasuke and Naruto can go toe to toe with each other, I don't think that Sasuke would have faired as well against Pain as Naruto did. Sasuke at the time is more of a finesse technical fighter that shines with one on one combat and I don't think he could handle the Six Paths as well as Naruto's could with Sage Mode and just his sheer power output when it comes to techniques that is needed against Pain in particular.

** Having binge read the story, I think I got why the perpetrator of the Nine tails attack did what did. Let me lay down the logic:

| The one upside that Ao had figured out, the one reason they were able to muster any defence

| at all, was the fact that the enemy was seemingly unable to teleport into a place they had not

| already visited. Ao had only once seen such a powerful teleportation technique before, and

| that had been far away in a distant land, and in a different era. The Fourth Hokage Namikaze

| Minato's Flying Thunder God technique... Could it be? Are we fighting Konoha once more?

​

First, I posit that Ao, correctly figured out the teleportation technique being used, which is Flying Thunder God. If the perpetrator of the Nine tails attack is Obito (likely), he does not have Kamui.

Now, if you want to put Flying Thunder God in all your secret hideouts, you cannot have another hostile user who can sense and then teleport at will to all those markings. Minato had to go.

Obito not having Kamui also explains why he avoided a direct confrontation with Minato, and did this elaborate assassination instead. His victory would be unlikely at best.

** How grimdark is this?

I was considering reading it, but grimderp recap I read in the current chapter made me reconsider.

Is it really representative of the story as a whole, though?

*** I would characterize the story as not feeling very dark. Its a story about ninjas, trained killers, there is a lot of death but it's not there with the intent to make life terrible and dark for it's main characters. Its just trying to represent it's setting accurately. Overall the characters take the deaths in stride, and it never breaks the reality of an arc by being ridiculously grimdark, nor does it dwell on the deaths for too long, having the characters bounce back, and ending up with a strong emotional range.

*** I don't think it's grimdark at all. I hate depressing stories and have never been able to finish them (I could barely sit through grave of the fireflies), so in NTBS I've made it so that characters tend to quickly move on from any trauma they've experienced. There's also plenty of lighthearted stuff in between. For example, this is an actual quote from this very same chapter:

#+begin_quote
  The illusory Naruto turned and thrust an angry finger at Sasuke. “You! I knew you were behind this somehow, you jerk. How dare you make a fully-sentient simulation of me against my will, you bastard!”

  Sasuke plugged his ear with one finger as if to block Naruto out, even though that made no sense in this context. “I figured Naruto might be better able to motivate you since the two of you got along so well at the academy,” he said. “It's only an illusion, but he keeps saying stuff like that without being prompted and it's really quite unnerving.”
#+end_quote

I dare you to try and fit those paragraphs into a grimdark story. I double-dog dare you.
