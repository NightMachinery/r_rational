Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I had a dream last night that I could see text messages from the future.

That's easy to munchkin: just sign up for a service that tells you the best performing stock for the next day, or have a friend text you once a day with the most important thing you'd need to know in the past. Or have a second phone and text it to yourself. Like the black pill(?) in that SSC story.

So, for something a little more interesting, it should be limited (or, at least, I'm saying that I don't want 100 different variations of "play the stock market" or "predict sports": assume that well is tapped unless you have something really innovative). You can see text messages from the future, but only messages that aren't sent in an attempt to "use" your power. (Ignore the fact that the definition of this sort of thing is more "I know it when I see it" than objective.)

So you can just see the "normal" messages your friends or spouses send you. Also, things like medical test results or appointment reminders. IDK.

(In my dream, FWIW, I used the power to determine whether I should be sending my ex text messages or not based on whether I was getting good responses, because dreams are dreams.)

I don't really get a lot of normal texts. Like basically zero other than for communicating instructions or immediately relevant information. If the power has a built in censor that shuts down deliberate manipulation, I'd have to actively go out of my way to make friends on [[/r/wallstreetbets]] or something in hopes of making a few friends who would naturally text about stock market movements. You could also seek out the kind of conspiracy theorists who will text incessantly about things that happen and what they /really/ mean. You should be able to gleam some general information about events, once you discard their personal spin on it. But that just gets us back to circumventing the rules you set.

If you could subscribe to major news sites and have them text you breaking news stories, you could use that to decide whether to pull the trigger on assassinations, major crimes, etc.

Really it all comes down to the censor, and what they decide to block. If you're allowed to seek out people who naturally talk a lot about specific topics, that helps. If I'm limited to going through my daily routines until I get information I can act on, the power is basically useless for me. Although I suppose it could still serve as some kind of disaster detector, since friends and family would be quite likely to text if they or I were present at the scene of some major natural disaster or similar.

**** I really appreciate the idea of curating text messaging friendships in order to "naturally" receive stock and natural disaster tips. Because you're right, future seeing powers are so hideously broken that the best choice you have is to try and unbreak it.

(also by "text message" I meant any sort of texting-adjacent service so Signal, Telegram, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc... though then you get in easy to munchkin territory by just joining the biggest group chats you can find)

***** Would i.e. a stock market summary that goes out to tens of thousands of people a day get filtered? If not, you're set; if so, just sign up for a bunch of daily news digests on various subjects. Even if not directly related to your goal areas it will be extraordinarily useful.

*** not really a powerful munchkin, but consider:

- write fiction is small, SMS sized increments

- send it to a professional editor/ghost writer to polish it.

- have them send it to you back as a text message

due to the way this future power works, you would just be getting constant stream of decent quality writing, without actually having to write anything or pay for anything, just the intent to do so would be enough to "trigger" the texts.

** You have the ability to have whatever ability/abilities the largest number of your enemies believes you have, where enemy is defined as a person who is actively seeking to harm you in accordance with what you believed to constitute harm immediately before receiving the power.

The specificity of any gained power is also defined by the largest quantity of people with specific beliefs as to their nature, with aggregate unconscious expectations being what determines their character if no specific beliefs as to their nature exist. You are also not above even the most heinous of crimes against humanity

*** The solution to belief-based powers is almost always starting a cult.

In this case, it is a little tricky because only the beliefs of your enemies count, your followers beliefs don't matter. So you would either need to convince your cult that you are the enemy, or get a cooperator to start a cult and designate you as the enemy of their god, then ascribe all kinds of supernatural powers to you as reasons for why god has not killed you yet and why none of the cultists should try.

*** In addition to the strategies mentioned by other commenters, you should try to cultivate mind-control and memory alteration powers. For example, as soon as you have the ability to alter beliefs and attitudes of a few people, as well as the ability to erase yourself from the memories of others, you can now sustainably give yourself any power you like.

Given this hypothetical, the most efficient way I can think of is some sort of JigSaw involving orphans, probably. It would be something like:

Capture a bunch of orphans (attack an orphanage or immorally abuse the foster care system until you get a good amount of orphans).

Convince that bunch of kids that they need to defeat their captor in a death game to escape. Technically the captor would be you, so you would be the enemy, but you would also be acting as a third party in opposition of the "captor". This way any abilities that they attribute to the captor or the helpful third party both apply to you.

Start convincing them of supernatural abilities and look to snowball in power.

First would be ability to detect lies. This will help "refine" the power source.

Then some ability with the capability to deal visible damage or kill. Use ability to detect lies to "root out" the most skeptical. Using this ability on the most skeptical will solidify the supernatural into far more believability.

Then some ability with the capability to help. With supernatural belief solidified, one should probably be able to convince them that the third party has the ability to strengthen them or heal wounds.

After that, I think it's a good enough foundation to eventually get to some power that would make any remaining problems trivial.

Memory rewriting, reality warping, time stop, precognition, omniscience, omnipotent, etc.

*** Tell your allies all about how great you are and how your powers can help them, then betray them to make enemies. Tell everyone slightly different details so that they don't know your actual power, since only the parts they agree on count.

Alternatively, be extremely benevolent and kind to make as few enemies as possible, and ruthless in the shadows to take out the few enemies you do make, so that the majority of your enemies are a harem of exes you cultivate, who are still a little bit in love with you. It's a more fragile state against sudden groups of enemies but it comes with better utility powers, since the love bitsjust make you better at everything.

Second alterative: just go full ham on being a psycho so everyone believes you're capable of anything, then build on that legend.

** You are a weak reality bender in [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][the SCP setting]]. By a lucky, improbably chain of events, you have come across a set of classified documents that describe what seems to fit your abilities, as well as the SCP foundation's (as well as their rival organizations) countermeasures for dealing with reality benders.

Because SCP foundation's canon is rather loose, here are some more specifications to your powers (as described by the documents... I am mostly following a few canons including these [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-supplemental-humanoid-guide][excerpts]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/clef101][seminars]], and [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-supplemental-thaumatology][lectures]], but I added details to better fit the Saturday munchkinry needs and to tie things together):

- At the initial unaware/unpracticed level of power (Phase 1), Reality Benders mostly have a high degree of luck (as shaped by their subconscious). I.e. they feel lucky/optimistic they have good luck, they feel unlucky/unoptimistic they have bad luck. This fits with several odd strings of events that you have experienced over the past few months.

- At the intermediate level (Phase 2-3), they start taking direct control of this luck. Whether through superstitions, religion, occult, self-help books, somehow they learn to consciously direct this self-belief and thus luck. Depending on the exact nature of the beliefs they fixate on this power might self-limit or self regulate in someway, for instance a superstition driven control means might be limited by the complexity of the superstitious rituals required or a religion based means of control might be limited by theological beliefs or guilt tied to the religion. You only have one instance in which you think you consciously controlled your powers... you recently tried to will yourself into finding an explanation for your strings of odd luck recently, and this seems to fit with you finding these documents.

- The majority (90-95%) of potential reality benders get stuck at Phase 3, but some move on to Phase 4. As they learn to explicitly control their powers, the reality bender becomes capable of explicitly intervening in reality often with various forms of power including matter creation, telekinesis, slowing or speeding up time (time reversal is much rarer, possibly not truly existent), mind alteration, retroactive rewriting of events, imbuing powers into objects or people, and more.

- As awesome as the Phase 4 powers sound... the users typically go insane, becoming obsessed with getting more and more power. Older research suspected this was simply a result of all the power leading to megalomania, or that mental illness was correlated with gaining reality bender powers however more recent research suggests that several specific actions tend to begin the spiral into insanity. The clearest cause of insanity is attempting to bootstrap their powers by altering their own mind/belief state. Other possible factors (the research is still being developed) in insanity include murder, altering other minds without their explicit consent, alteration of other's bodies without their explicit consent, rape, attempting to bootstrap powers by retroactively altering ones past, other forms of permanent self-alteration, and pacts with otherworldly entities.

- Phase 5 benders are mostly theoretical, it is thought that a few major disruptions to reality were the result of Phase 5 benders using their powers and accidentally erasing themselves or banishing themselves to pocket dimensions in the process.

- No matter how powerful reality benders get, their powers are bound by their perception of reality. If they can't perceive something, (in at least some sense) they can't affect it. In weaker reality benders (Phase 3 and early 4), this means they have to explicitly see or feel something, for more moderately powerful reality they can use hearing or memory of seeing something (Phase 4), the most powerful can work off of accurate imagining of something (later Phase 4). Related to this, extrasensory powers and super senses are rare in reality benders, for some reason they have a hard time enhancing their own sensory ability.

- Creation of anomalous objects is possible but unreliable. They generally only have a single power and quirky/esoteric/dangerous side effects that are partly random and partly based around the subconscious biases of the reality bender.

- Reality bender powers are also often limited by information as well. For example if the bender tries to bring back a dead person, the resurrected person be missing memories and aspects of their personality, only possessing memories/personality that fit with living people's memories and factual information that is available. In the case of a weaker reality bender the resurrected might only have memories that match the bender's memories. Likewise permanent biological alteration might require the bender's continued use of power to remain stable as they can't fully visualize the complexity of living biology. This limitation can be /partly/ bypassed by working around it or with careful research and collection of information. In the case of raising the dead, it might be more effective to retroactively make it so they didn't die in the first place. The more inconsistencies in reality this would cause, the more power it takes to do. Careful planning of the reality bending to minimize inconsistency can partly work around it. Likewise, with permanent biological alteration, careful scientific research to ensure the end result is biologically possible and self-consistent will reduce the need to actively maintain it.

- *You'll only be able to manage one or two minor Phase 4 powers and the occasional anomalous object (a few months of artistic/creative work to produce an object) if you avoid bootstrapping/self-alteration.*

Of the countermeasures:

- The SCP Foundation heavily, automatically, and actively monitors the stock market and lotteries for unlikely chains of events. They also have a slower, less active manual review of news reports and internet media for unusual phenomena.

- The Foundation has sensors called "Kant counters" that can sense the reality fluctuations caused by reality benders when their powers are active. Kant counters are non-directional, it takes a set of them and timing information to triangulate reality alteration. Also, unless the reality bender is actively using powers, they cannot identify reality benders themselves. Phase 3 abilities are almost undetectable unless the bender is right on top of a sensor, various Phase 4 abilities are detectable from different distances: retroactive alteration of reality (with no inconsistencies, which is hard to do) from hundreds of meters, telekinesis/mind alteration/matter alteration from a few kilometers, matter creation from tens of kilometers, retroactive alteration of reality with minor inconsistencies from tens of kilometers, retroactive alteration of reality with heavy inconsistencies from hundred of kilometers, creation of pocket realities from hundreds of kilometers, altering the flow of time from hundreds of kilometers. Multiple sensors exist around all major SCP foundation sites along with additional (disguised) sensors at U.S. military bases, various scientific institutions, and in major cities.

- The Foundation is mostly based in America, Russia, and places where the American or Russian military can strong arm their way into control of anomalies.

- For Phase 3 benders, the Foundation actively monitors them after identifying them. For Phase 4 benders, the Foundation typically attempts to bring them in with sedation and then neutralize their powers with a "Scranton Reality anchor" (a device that counteracts the reality fluctuations tied to reality bender power usage). If they can't be brought in, the Foundation shifts to termination.

- A rival organization, the Global Occult Coalition has a zero tolerance policy, even Phase 2-3 reality benders are terminated at all costs.

- The GOC doesn't have Kant counter but instead has Elan Vital Emission (EVE) sensors. These sensor, which in implementation are work like bulky cameras, can identify reality benders on sight, but can't detect them from a distance.

- The GOC is mostly based in the European Union, with a minimal presence in America.

- The preferred method of termination (for both the GOC and Foundation) is a sniper bullet fired with a velocity faster than the speed of sound is the preferred method of execution, as most reality bender lack extra sensory ability. Other methods similarly focus on being lethal, fast, and surprising.

- Another organization, Marshall, Carter and Darke, caters to the tastes of the rich and powerful with anomalous artifacts and objects. It is speculated they have a handful of more stable reality benders on retainer that they pay for anomalous objects, even with the dangerous side-effects they often have. You have no idea how to contact them other than the fact that they are tied to various super wealthy people.

- The Serpent's Hand is a collection of cults/secret societies/magical organizations with access to a massive extradimensional library. They are rumored to offer either sanctuary or banishment to pocket dimensions to reality benders.

So a few prompts/questions:

Best ways to abuse your luck control without being caught?

What minor Phase 4 powers would you pick to get the most out of them while avoiding detection and insanity?

Would you risk the insanity for just a bit more power?

Any ideas for clever tricks to increasing your self-belief without going insane or losing touch with reality?

Clever ideas to throw the Foundation or GOC off your tail?

Ideas for establishing contact with MC&D or Serpent's Hand?

How would you optimize or improve the Foundation's or GOC's approach to reality benders?

** *Time Loop and WW2 era Poland:*

On September 1 , 1939 Poland was attacked by the Nazis, and 2 weeks later by the Soviets.

Imagine if the second the clock ticks 12 PM , on September 30, 1939, every Pole was sent back to September 1, with all the knowledge they got since. (For the sake of the argument, this is purely mental time travel like in *Mother of Learning*).

How could Poland use that power to fend of the Nazis and the Soviets and keep their independence? How many loops would it take until they could win decisively? What would be your strategy if you were the leader of the Polish army and knew about the Loop?
