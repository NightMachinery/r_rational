[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4x4w7v/biweekly_challenge_black_and_white_morality/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Black and White Morality". The winner was [[/u/blasted0glass]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4x4w7v/biweekly_challenge_black_and_white_morality/d6lp2or][Won't Do You Any Good]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/blasted0glass]]! You are the winner by default, but no less of a winner for it.

This time, the challenge will be *"Underground"*. The only requirement is that the story takes place mostly underground, whether it's in a cave, a bunker, a basement, or during a journey to the center of the earth. Suggestions for stories or settings to rationalize (if you prefer not writing purely original content); The Core, Wool, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Dante's Inferno, The City of Ember, or Faerun's Underdark.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, September 7th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

Next time we'll be doing *"Moloch"*. If you haven't already, go read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]]. If you're too lazy for that, I think it can be best summed up as "many systems are composed of individual elements with their own optimization functions which work in their own favor but to the detriment of the system as a whole". This is a very abstract topic, and I highly suggest making it concrete by thinking about 'Moloch' in the context of a business, government, colony, species, etc.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 9/7.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zg37r/challenge_companion_underground/][is here]].

** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcTFMA1yy9SzxZTMw_i4Lv5nytISJyKS0ELYrR-RUI4/edit][Echoes]], a short elaboration on the history behind certain events in Undertale. Spoilers for it, of course, and this isn't particularly rational, but I did promise to put out SOMETHING for this challenge, and my fanfic isn't quite ready to publish yet.
