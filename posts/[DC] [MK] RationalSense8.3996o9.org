So I recently finished Sense8 ([[http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80025744?trkid=13462047][Netflix]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense8][Wiki]]), and the world that it laid out was quite interesting. I found the series didn't focus as much on the mechanical exploration of the central conceit as I would have liked, but that's why we have [[/r/rational]]. I think we can come up with some cool possibilities based on the following observed rules of the universe. Please, inform me if I'm missing any, or if any are imperfectly accurate.

- Some people in the world are born "Sensate", and have special abilities beyond normal humans. It is unclear the basis for this.

- When are person is born as a sensate, they are linked to the rest of their "cluster" who was born at the exact same time, although this link is inactive.

- Any sensate, whether or not they have been reborn, has the ability to visit other conscious sensates they have been close to and locked eyes with. The difficulty of this depends on both parties: some can force a connection against resistance including reading surface thoughts, while recently reborn have difficulty controlling it at all.

- When visiting someone, you leave your body on autopilot under subconscious control: you cannot perform complex tasks such as driving, but you will stay standing, walking and talking.

- While visiting someone else, you are as a voice in their head, able to communicate without audible sound being created. You can also sense anything they can sense. You cannot sense anyone else visiting them, unless everyone is part of of your cluster.

- While someone is visiting you, you cannot communicate to them except via mundane means - you will appear to be talking to air to anyone else, unless you are all part of the same cluster.

- An existing Sensate who is part of an active cluster may through a great effort of will, "birth" a new active cluster, causing 8 passively linked Sensates to be "reborn" as an active cluster.

- A reborn Sensate can instinctively visit anyone in their cluster without having previously seen them. They can also "share" exclusively with their cluster: accessing each others' knowledge, language, and skills. Knowledge, memory, and language are shared passively, while skills often mean the other member of the cluster must drive your body temporarily. This is seamless, and can feel as easy as somebody handing you something they made.

- There is always some level of feedback within a cluster for powerful stimuli that others can feel without actively visiting: loud music, powerful emotions (including arousal), gunshots, etc.

Given these constraints, how do you push the boundaries of possibility? Obvious spoilers in comment section.


** Try for a polyamorous relationship immediately. You are going to be living with these people having access to your mind for the rest of your life. So try for the best possible connection.

Focus on specialization. If all skills can be shared then figure out what you are better at learning than everyone else in the group and learn it. Of course if it turns out that a skill can be enhanced to superhuman level by having more than one person independently learning it, then there should be an overlap of at least two (or more depending on how skills scale up with number of people) people knowing the same important abilities.

If everyone focuses on learning the same thing at the same time, then skills should be acquired very quickly. More so if it's things like combat where the group can 'see' both sides of a fight. This translates to better problem solving.

Since there's a telepathic connection, it can be abused for whenever information needs to get from one part of the world to another very quickly without anyone else outside of the group being able to intercept it.

Sorry I don't have anymore ideas since I haven't seen the show. Thanks for the interesting thought exercise.

**** Hmm, good point. I assumed it was something where he wanted based on his repeated admonitions to take them alive. Unclear if that was just a means to an end for him though.

***** I believe he wanted them alive so that he could look them in the eye and be able to find the rest easier [[#s][last episode spoilers]]

** Aggregating resources (money, time, skills), moving out of respective life positions temporarily, and setting up abstract defenses like proper encryption and psychic security protocols until the big bad is dealt with. However, the series already feels pretty rational. The exploits that work tend to take a while and a lot of the show is them realizing their powers.
