** I think it's more that "power level" type stuff is a profoundly lazy way to set things up. I haven't watched much of DBZ, but from what I've seen of the combat a fight between the strongest people in the universe this week is (as you say) much the same as a fight between the strongest people in the universe two months ago. They grunt and float and teleport around punching, kicking, and launching big flashy orbs and rays of energy. We're just meant to understand that this week's big glowy ball represents ... more joules of spirit energy, I guess? They're moving faster, punching harder, and absorbing harder hits, but all this is under-the-hood because there's no way to depict that in a visually coherent way with a cartoon.

In RPG terms, they're using the same old techniques, but with higher stats. Good RPGs don't do that; they gradually introduce new abilities that expand your options and broaden gameplay. If a new DBZ enemy required a change in tactics, or if the main character acquired a remarkably different new ability, that would mix things up. It would also require considerably greater effort to pull off and keep going long-term, so they have power levels. Raising numbers is easy, and they don't even have to tell you what the numbers are in this case.

** People may not like it but IMHO power caps are good and make stories more interesting. When there's a power cap suddenly strategy, tactics, deceit and other interesting combat methods mean something.

​

You can have armies, and other valid group on group combat situations. Little optimizations and interesting combinations make a difference. Armor, weapons and equipment tend to be more relevant.

​

It's the old 'Limitations are what make anything interesting' and it's variances in writing and game design advice. If characters can just get more powerful indefinitely suddenly a lot of interesting scenarios and events, will never be able to appear in the story coherently or rationally.

*** I don't think it's a lack of a power cap that causes the problem. I think it's the lack of a plan. You can see very similar phenomena with "event fatigue" or stories that keep throwing out big reveals with no overarching plan.

As a case in point, /Burn Notice/. If you're unfamiliar, the story of /Burn Notice/ is that Michael Westen used to be a spy, but got burned by forces unknown, and is now trying to track them down. And then at the end of the first season he does that. But then in the second season, he discovers that there's another conspiracy. And then another one after that. And so on for seven seasons, until it becomes total absurd.

So the key is not to stop advancement, but to have some idea of what people are advancing /to/. You have to understand in advance what the end-state of the progression is, and write things so that getting there is satisfying. And my impression is that DBZ pretty much didn't do that at all. It just keeps not getting cancelled and they just keep making characters more powerful, without any overarching logic.

**** That is definitely an issue that leads to a similar outcome, in your case more of a the author planned this much story but people want more and his editors and employers force him to continue until it stops making money.

It happens a lot with tv shows, anime and anything that it's existence is dependent on it's popularity and (or) it's inherent purpose is generating income. I think some of the bad arcs and the decay that tends to happen can and often are a conscious decision of the author.

Sometimes the story is over and you just want to move on and start the next one but you can't because your editor or publisher won't let you because this one is at peak popularity, which is arguably the perfect point to stop quality wise but the worst one financially.

My issue with lack of power caps comes more from, what I already said and, how they remove some of my favorite parts and interesting situations I'd like to see explored in that world / magic system. I prefer nuanced creative displays of skill, rather than my number is higher / I trained harder / I have an OP gimmick (that's not munchkin and I lucked upon) so I win.

But don't you still get that dynamic for everyone below the power cap? Even if you can only go up to 10, you can still beat up someone who's an 8 by training more.

Ultimately, I don't think there's a setting-level way to avoid this kind of problem. If there's any power variance (and there always will be, even if it's just "I am the President and you are not"), there will always be underleveled opposition to fight. The author just has to be smart enough to realize that a story about a guy who goes around curb stomping everyone who gets in his way isn't very interesting, and opt to write a story about appropriately leveled opposition instead.

****** The problem isn't that there's variance and that people can have different levels of power, but more so that if there isn't a limit to individual power levels problems tend to rise up.

There are ways of making power scales where numbers still matter even when the difference isn't stupid like 10v1, where raw power isn't the defining factor in combat, where there can't be such a high difference in speed and response time between elites that most combatants become irrelevant..

What I hate about this trope is that it retroactively ruins great character dynamics, especially between a protagonist and a foil.

To use another example: The Daniel Craig Bond films.

You start out with "Le Chiffre is working with terrorists." That's set up at the very start of the film. Then you take a step back, and learn that Le Chiffre and Vesper Lind are under the thumb of a mysterious organization called Quantum. This is set up in the first film, and paid off in the next; that's all fine.

But, in the third film, we meet Raoul Silva, who is set up as a foil to Bond, that is, a character who is much like the protagonist; someone who the protagonist can be easily contrasted against. Both of them have been through trauma at the hands of MI6, both have reasons to turn against it and to seek revenge against M. Silva does, Bond doesn't. That is the basis for a great character dynamic.

Then /SPECTRE/ comes along, and Silva is now, retroactively, a pawn of Blofeld's. Instead of being about a man who remains loyal to an organization and its ideals, despite all of the abuse it's inflicted upon him, against a man who is willing to bring that organization down because of the abuse /he/ has suffered, /Skyfall/ becomes... the agent of "the good guys" against the agent of "the bad guys."

And that seems to be the pattern with Matryoshka conspiracies; they're set up to be some sort of foil to the good guys and their intentions and goals, but then the next layer of the onion is revealed, and the relationship between the protagonists and the layer they just defeated no longer makes sense, as the old villain wasn't /really/ out for their own twisted version of what the main characters want, they were just pawns in a bigger game.

**** I think /Burn Notice/ works as an episodic show because it has one formula, the formula works, and it sticks to it without fail. Any given episode is a tightly plotted story with some action, some explosions, and some spy intrigue. The episodes are very formulaic, with Michael his pals bringing the same skills to the table each time, and in each episode you can generally rely on a twist or two followed by some improvisation. But it works because each time you get to wonder, /okay, how is Michael going to bluff his way out of this one?/ and it always manages to be entertaining. And every once in a while you'll get a Big Villain like Larry to spice things up, and on occasion it will have a nice way of tying in the overarching plot to the plot-of-the-episode.

I don't think the series' overarching plot is its strong point, and I also agree that it sometimes throws things out without a plan, as evidenced by some of its loose ends, but I disagree with your characterization of it as 'conspiracy behind a conspiracy', and I'd say each season generally moves the story forward with reasonable pacing. Season 1, Michael is out in the cold, know idea what's going on. Season 2, he's forced to work for the conspiracy. Season 3, he's rebuked their help, he's out in the cold again, trying to get back in with the gov. That blows up. Season 4 is somewhat similar to season 2, but he's more than just a grunt in the organization now, and he actually strikes a deadly blow against the conspiracy at the end. Time skip here, good decision, we don't have to sit through them working their way through every grunt of this org. Season 5-6, dealing with the very last man from this same conspiracy. This part has some good reveals in it, too. Season 7, new villains entirely, but now it's the government with their screws in Michael. I think this last season was the weakest, actually, and I also thought Tom Card was an uninteresting villain, but for seasons 1 - half of 6, Michael isn't dealing with a conspiracy-behind-a-conspiracy-behind... he's mostly just making actual progress clawing through one big conspiracy. The audience understands the end-goal: take down the conspiracy that burned Michael and get back in with the government. This /actually happens,/ and then we get a new goal: Michael is sick of this shit and starts talking about retiring with Fi, and Michael has to spend the last couple of seasons dealing with the obstacles towards that goal.

** This entire setup is based upon the false assumption that you need character growth only along a single axis, and that 'power' only exists on that axis, and that there are no drawbacks for using it. It assumes the "Goku problem".

Such limited works, such as DBZ, invariably write themselves into a corner both because they never considered this when they started, and the series went on for far too long. If the series had ended after the first few major story arcs, it wouldn't have been so bad, but the /first arc of the series/ had people who could move at FTL in hand-to-hand combat while also being capable of employing attacks that could /destroy a planet/. And this was /excluding/ any transformations or 'power upgrades' (well, except by the main protagonist, who had to use his semi-transformation to keep up with the villain). Each new arc just cranked things up to a ridiculous level, but the writers would try and obfuscate this with the numbers, nevermind that later they claimed certain feats were impossible or had the characters gasp in awe at something one did... even though such a thing may have been done many times in previous arcs.

What do you do when your dial was already cranked up to 11 in a story based around combat? The wrong choice is to just stay on that one axis and crank up the numbers, which eventually gives you the "Goku problem".

The trick is to write your stories that use more than one axis for measuring their characters--so that they can have things outside their comfort zone that require growth and so that other characters might have a chance to shine with their set of skills. Or both.

This is what I like to call the "Superman solution".

Take Superman. He is functionally the most physically powerful being in his multiverse. There is no real limit to his strength. He has literally lifted objects of infinite weight. *But*... he has many other limitations. He is not omnipresent, he is not omniscient, and he adheres to a code of morality. In his universe, he could easily go out and murder anyone who opposed him with only the barest minimum of effort, if he chose. Lex Luthor? Easily dealt with (and no, not that Metropolitan Man nonsense that requires you to hand him a giant Idiot Ball to lose with). Even high tier threats like Darkseid can be defeated locally, if not permanently. The thing is, he /won't/ choose to use this power except under certain conditions. In short, he is really good at *hitting things*. So what do the writers do? If he's a main character, they put him in situations where /hitting things can't solve his problems/.

Then there's the kryptonite issue (as well as the 'weakness' to magic). His power has loopholes which can be abused, such that his ability to instantly win can be potentially be taken away. There are threats which he can not deal with directly, but he /can/ think his way around them, either coming up with another solution, or being forced to rely on *other people with different skills* to assist him. Sometimes the former is the latter, and so you see him ask help from the Justice League, or even his non superpowered friends. Sometimes, though, the guy who is good at hitting things has to surprise his opponents by /outsmarting/ them.

A third potential possibility is to include *drawbacks* for using ones strength. In both DBZ and DC, the higher power 'good guys' generally don't want to unleash their maximum potential inside an inhabited area, while the 'bad guys' sometimes have no issue with this. Thus, the characters can't just unload at full strength, but have to get crafty. (DBZ loses this later, obviously, by setting everything in places the audience doesn't really care about.) Another option is to seed a 'cost' or 'drawback' into the primary axis of power. Male Channelers in the /Wheel of Time/ series by Robert Jordan steadily went crazy the more magic they used. In the case of /Avatar, the Last Airbender/, the Avatar State was an insane power upgrade, but if the Avatar ever died in that state, *it was gone forever*, and for a protagonist who reincarnates down through the ages, that was a truly final fate. Both are extreme examples, but it's not difficult to come up with lesser scenarios.

There are numerous ways to handle the "Goku problem", but most of them require a bit of planning and forethought... both in worldbuilding, and what the story hopes to accomplish. Also, it helps to assume (even if unlikely) that at some point you might want to write more, so leaving an 'out' as to how to continue it from the beginning is probably a good idea.

** In EverQuest and World of Warcraft and most other MMORPGs, there is "mudflation" of skills and abilities and power levels with every release of new content.

Consider the strongest monster in a game, a scourge on the world that takes dozens of the strongest players in a raid to defeat (and we will hand wave away the fact that it respawns for another raid an hour or a day later). Then a new expansion comes out with a higher level cap, better gear, and a new strongest monster. Suddenly it only takes one group (usually 5-6) of players to defeat the old big boss. Then yet another expansion comes out, and some players can solo the original big boss.

But of course these players still can't handle the guards in the main city. Why aren't those guards going out and clearing the world of the sorts of menace represented by the original big boss?

** I think this kind of thinking is missing the forest for the trees. The reason progression fantasy gets stale is the same reason series where the status quo is God get stale. Except unlike those stories, which usually at least have a broad cast of characters that interact with each other, progoression fantasy is set up so that any excess narrative weight gets discarded, like alliances, characters, motivations, and everything else.

Relaged to that problem, we never see characters in situations where "punch problem to make it stop" is not a valid solution. Drought? Don't worry. Plague? Not in this story. Character conflict? You'll get to punch them later.

There's a webcomic, Strong Female Protagonist, that is explicitly about this. The main character retires from superheroing because she realizes that most of the world's problems are unpunchable, and the stories are mostly about her trying to figure out what she /should/ be doing with her tragically punching-centric powerset. Unfortunately it's been on hiatus for a long time and is probably dead.

These are the conclusions I came to when writing my litrpg. Going for primarily 1 (setting to accommodate), but a little bit of 2 (power level/conflict is not source of tension). I won't talk about 1, because that would be way too specific to my story and way too long. But as far as 2 goes I am using rationalism to solve it; people here like paragraphs of text thinking through problems, identifying biases, solving mysteries, deconstructing tropes, and often accept that as a decent form of tension.

Heck my first major conflict stretches across three chapters (4.5k words) but I'm pretty sure less than 10% of that is the actual conflict.

** I think this view of the problem misses the mark. Construing it as a treadmill of power is actually a way to lead yourself right towards the mistake. What causes stories to go stale so quickly is that their authors don't know how to keep them fresh, not so much that what they're doing is intrinsically an issue. The problem with Progression Fantasy specifically is more than the wealth of examples new writers have are not very good at mitigating structural problems.

Stories need to constantly and consistently reinvent themselves to stay fresh. New character dynamics need to be introduced, new situations, new information. A powerup is a possible answer, but has diminishing returns when used over and over again, so good stories know how to pace those and sandwich them between other fresh ingredients. I would argue the main problem Progression Fantasy stories have with mitigating staleness is that most of the effort that goes into the writing is poured into the powers and their escalation, while all those other ingredients are left in a superficial state and not developed very much. They usually end up reading like some kind of novelized walkthrough to a videogame, rather than the experiences of a character (or more) being faced with new situations and having a reaction to them. Emotions are muted. The writing doesn't give developments the weight they need.

The Gamer, to use a well-known example, has Gamer's Mind, an ability that exists solely to justify the flat emotional landscape of the protagonist and the superficial nature of his relationships with others. Is it fun to see him gain more and more power? Yes. But when the story tries to sandwich that between interactions with the setting or other characters it ends up feeling immaterial and like a waste of time. Eventually the escalation loses luster and the story feels stale.

To use another well-known example: "Kumo Desu ga, Nani ka?" spends so much time with the protagonist killing and eating in a survival scenario that it fails to develop anything else, and by the time it tries to shift gears there's no way to salvage it. Very few people will accept and enjoy the shift to third person and to seeing the protagonist from the perspective of weaker characters.

The simplest way to give weight and depth to things is to dedicate wordcount to them. Falling into the trap of having most of your wordcount be an exploration of numbers going up without a plan B is a recipe for staleness.

** I agree with you generally but it doesn't have to be bad writing ( though clearly is in DBZ) It doesn't make sense that someone relatively weak has heard to the most powerful people in the universe. Part of the treadmill is that you gain agency that you also will also gain awareness or the ability to travel farther. When you're a kid your world is limited to first walking around the house , then your neighborhood with a bike, and the the city with the car.
