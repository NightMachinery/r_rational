I saw on the last batch of chapters for WTC a lot of ideas of gold magic, and how Juniper might be wrong about its lack of thematic function. The biggest one was that it lets mortals match dragons by amassing a 'hoard', which is interesting on its own, and maybe implies that "gold" magic is just a subset of "hoard" magic which dragons just know more about than most people. But I didn't see anyone talking about a different thematic connection, and I wanted to bring it up now.

Gold Magic is the absent father.

We've seen a lot of magic at this point, for more than a few of them, they've been emotionally connected to Juniper, or some member of the party. Grak is a warder because he feels walled off from the world, Solace teaches flower magic because she tries to generate personal connections, Raven's library magic is an extension of the desire to organize a world that doesn't make sense, and even water magic involves Juniper tapping into an understanding of depression. Similarly, I think gold magic reflects one of these deeper issues, and specifically I think it's the effect that money - or a job - can have on the parent.

To a young kid, it can often be confusing to have one or both of your parents missing for big chunks of every day. Growing up as a latchkey kid really highlights this; you're on your own, you're taking care of yourself more than being taken care of. Even if you're in a single-provider home, where it's probably your dad going off to work and taking business trips, it creates this feeling of cold aloofness that seriously harms your ability to make a connection with that person.

The call of the gold is, metaphorically, the job. But not just that, it's prioritizing the job /over your family/, which we see Juniper do almost right away. Tactile telekinesis does a lot of stuff, but the two biggest things are almost impervious armor, and the ability to fly. It makes someone untouchable. It makes them distant. Even as it motivates them to cut away their emotional connections, it mirrors that by letting them cut off their physical connections as well. And if you ever ignore the call of the gold?

Well, if you call in sick too many days in a row, you get fired. And you may find yourself with more free time for your family, but the connections you let atrophy are still damaged in the aftermath.

Anyway. That's my little take on it. I like looking for the emotional themes in WTC's magic, because it feels like most of the systems have /something/ going on in them. Though I haven't got a clue what the thematic undertone for blood magic is yet. Maybe someone can catch me up in the comments.


** I love the ideas people have here, so here's my two cents!

A - Ultra Wealth.

and

B - Sunken Costs.

A represents the endless acquisition of wealth. You don't need to have this ludicrous amount of gold. You could probably spend it better then on Gold Magic in most situations, just hire an army or purchase some personal entads with your literal tons of gold. By leaving it unspent, and just as importantly denying others access to it, you warp the world around you and gain direct personal power.

B, on the other hand, is the one I consider most likely, because /in for a penny, in for a pound/ is a literal description of how Gold Magic works. You can't tread water with Gold Magic. You either give up the power you have, or go to ever greater lengths to hold on to it. The longer you maintain your magic, the more your power and wealth grows, the more you have to lose when it ends. The more you listen to the voice telling you to do whatever extreme actions it demands, the more you've already paid for this power and wealth, the greater the sunk cost and the more willing you are to go further next time. Becoming a Gold Mage itself is a sunk cost: You can only do it once. Gold Magic is digging yourself in ever deeper rather then taking the loss.

The path of a successful Gold Mage ends one of two ways: The willing surrender of all that power, or tragedy.

Related, the Skill for Gold Magic doesn't correlate to the raw power of the gold mage. We don't know what the actual skill does, only it involves dealing with gold magic rather then directly being it. Does it represent the ability to resist the voice, to balance on that knifes edge to minimise the increase and needs? Or is it the other way, unlocking new possibilities without actually helping with the escalating costs you pay?

I think a possible reason the powers of Gold Magic don't look as detailed or thematically tied as the others of Aerb is because its a waste to give something more nuanced to Gold magic: The core interest of Gold Magic is the treadmill it puts you on and its inevitable loss.

** #+begin_quote
  the ability to fly
#+end_quote

Fun parallel: the /Flying Man/ in Earthbound is also a symbol of the absent father. He's a big protector man who you don't know very well, but who is willing to swoop in and protect/die for you. Why is he called the "Flying Man"? Well, besides the literal-layer stuff (he has an eagle head), Ness's father is always away travelling---flying. Ness only talks to him over the phone. And when he does, other than a little always-the-same patter about how he's proud of Ness, the main thing Ness's father does is throw money at him.

I think the fact that Gold Magic's flying ability is "implemented as" tactile telekinesis, is where the dissonance comes in: it's pretty obviously just a reference to /Mistborn's/ allomancy---the "burning" of metals to gain magic abilities. The two most common types of allowance in /Mistborn/ are burning Iron to become magnetically repulsive, and burning Iron to become magnetically attractive. Neither of these is "gold"; but gold /is/ still a metal, so it's kind of intuitive (if DM-Joon had read /Mistborn/, but not /recently/) to say "oh yeah, let's make 'gold' magic---a magic with metals, so like /Mistborn/, right? What-all did that magic system let you do again?" and then remember the Pushing/Pulling stuff before anything else.

  thematic undertone for blood magic
#+end_quote

Ever watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/469/Karin][Karin]]? The feat for blood magic is "hypertension", and you can heal people by transfusing blood into them. So assume the protagonist of this show is a prototype healer-build blood mage.

Ever watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata][Kyokai no Kanata]]? The Claret Spear is pretty literally the weapon of the female lead in this show; and the ability to /harm/ people by putting your blood inside them (whether you intend to or not) is one of the central conflicts. So assume the protagonist of /this/ show is a prototype combat-build blood mage.

Then just realize that they're both /high-level/ characters of their respective builds, so you need to invent some lower-tier abilities for the build to have. Maybe base them on monks---qigong meditation is essentially about purifying the blood to give yourself more stamina, right?

In both of the above presumed-sources, blood is thematically about 1. irrevocably connecting people whether they like it or not, with both potentially positive and negative consequences; 2. a symbolic barrier of inherent "incompatibility" between people that must be overcome. Both are good focus-points at the /start/ of a fellowship story---so blood magic is mostly going to see a lot of use in the beginning of a story set in a world where it exists, to explore those themes. Once characters /have/ been irrevocably connected and broken through any inherent incompatibilities, it's kind of irrelevant.

** Very astute. I like the emotional approach, and it's a good effort. I still think it wouldn't have to be telekinesis. A sort of shield you can move and bash with and stand on would make more sense to me. One that is literally gold. I suspect that the interlocutor for the call is actually a devil, and gold magic and gold mages are how they interact with the living world on a more regular basis than non Anima. I'm probably also wrong, but I also noticed it seemed to be very precisely putting strains on his personal relationships. Blood magic could be the inexorable march of technology. Juniper starts with fire, then spears, but soon it's allowing him to fight more creatively and even come close to flying. At insane upper levels, it allows a person to make a bomb that could take out most of an EZ. Or maybe it's saying that conflict and combat are inherent in how humanity interacts with tools. "It's in our blood."

** I think the issue with gold magic as articulated in the chapter is that the source of the power (acquiring gold) has nothing to do with the conferred power (tactile telekinesis). With emotional magic, for example, the conferred powers are thematically related to strong emotions, like moving fast when you feel fear. To get access to other powers like revision magic, you have to revise away a year or do something similarly thematically connected. Tactile telekinesis is a cool thing, and gold acquisition is a cool thing, and you can come up with thematic resonances to other concepts for either. But they aren't themselves thematically connected, which is the issue.

** Hurm, I think your theory that gold magic represents "capitalism" and the wage slavery it imposes on the many makes perfect sense. It's not even subtle if you think about it. I suppose if the voice in his head ever starts screaming at him to literally impose 100% slavery on people, it'll have more than a small amount of merit.

While not explicitly in the text... it's a fair assumption that Aumann had slaves working hard to increase his personal wealth and power - it would be outrageously out of character if he didn't. The employees that appear onscreen are merely the inner upper crust of his organization - [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs][every pyramid scheme requires a few token examples of affluence]] to give false hope to those on the bottom of the system. And the loyalty of your military is priority #1, as it's the only thing that matters in these power systems.

I see this being rather depressing to explore, as it brings up facts like how [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcCxsLDma2o][the US constitution still allows slavery to this very day]], and how people are Perfectly Fine with this. Due to that, I do expect Joon will be dropping this skill sooner than later.

Or maybe we'll have a 50 page arc on how he really, really wants to cut wages and benefits for the frog people and starts bullying Grak into doing some contract work on the side... maybe start up a theme park in the locus's territory with doe rides and such... yeah, we need to move on to woodworking sooner than later.

Insane robot army made of wood, with value misalignment. That's way more fun.

Edit: I've changed my mind once the theme park idea occurred to me. A "Joon becomes a total asshole" arc will be great if it focuses on him monetizing his friends in stupid ways, and not so much on exploiting his peasants.

** Great analysis here on Gold Magic, it really ties it all together well. My thoughts on Blood Magic though:

Blood Magic is about your place in the world and relationship to it. You draw power directly from yourself and your body (your blood) and shape it to affect your interactions with others and the world at large (through the usage of external spells) and as means of using this power/knowledge for altering yourself (through buff-related spells). The transfusion-esque applications (like the bloodline spell) are a recognition of social connections, with your decisions influencing the actions, abilities and capabilities of others.

Narratively, the fact that the first magic Juniper learns, after entering a world directly patched together from his own ideas, is a reflection of the strength of recognising your influence over the world reinforces Juniper's burgeoning understanding of the scope of the story as a whole, and his place in it. Blood Magic becomes less a focus as the story progresses, as his understanding and interactions shift from "being the lever that moves the world" to being an actor on a stage, so to speak, both in terms of how much of his path is laid out in front of him by the DM, and in terms of how many other actors are on this proverbial stage (all the different beings and organisations of power and influence). Whilst Juniper can still exert his influence over events, there are constraints and boundaries imposed by how others will both act and react.

All that said, most of that thinking came from sitting around waiting for my dinner to finish up in the oven for ~15 minutes, so I've focused on fitting things together rather than poking holes in it to properly test this theory. Right now, it seems a little suspiciously tidy for me to wholeheartedly support what I've written out, but my food's waiting so I'll stop here.

(Also something something food for thought)

*** Second of all, I acknowledge your food for thought pun.

First of all, I do quite like the thought of blood magic being about centering the self in a world, and being more narrative than in-universe emotional. It's weird that Juniper learns it quickly, and then it's.. not thrown away, exactly, but it's just sort of background noise from then on. And that being narratively linked to how he's not just fighting his way through a hostile world anymore, and more trying to shape a world that's already tamed, is interesting.

I suspect it may just be cool.

Either that or it's some sort beating heart, love, mixing of blood metaphor for closeness, given how often it's used in situations with people that Juniper loves.

As the father of a 3 year old, this hits hard. My son definitely doesn't understand why I choose to/have to be gone all day. I love coming home for lunch and spending some time with him before he goes down for his afternoon rest, but he wishes I could stay with him all day. He goes to bed at 8 pm, which leaves only a few short hours of the day for time with Dad.

One piece of advice I'll give to other parents out there that my father gave to me: Most kids will not miss you as much in the morning as they will in the evening. A bleary "Good morning, I love you, got to go!", or shared hustle as you all go through the motions to get ready for the day is only confusing when they want you to stay home and spend time with them. Instead, if at all possible, get to the shop at 6 or 7am so you can be home when school is out/rest is done. That is far better than working 9-5, splitting time with your kids to an hour in the morning and 2 hours, one of which gets taken up by dinner and a half hour of which is putting them to bed, in the evening.

** hmmm that is... one way to look at it. Of course it's not known to be /wrong/ per se, but I don't really grok the impulse to push stories this deeply into metaphors when there isn't much or any explicit reference confirming that metaphor over others. Maybe sometimes, maybe even often, an author does have some hidden themes they're exploring for fun as they write a story. But to me, unless the author explicitly shares their intent, trying to fit story elements into deep yet unconfirmed metaphors fails to gain my mental buy-in because there's no way to validate the result. It's a free-association exercise where I can think of completely different metaphors that also "fit" just as well. If others also fit that's demonstrating both a lack of explanatory power and a lack of any certainty in the connection to the reality of the story's universe that would give the explanation emotional weight. Worse, if I then buy into one metaphor over another, I'll have skewed expectations. My skewed expectations then make the story less enjoyable when in all likelihood the author doesn't deliver on whatever random metaphor I took as a promise from their setup.

Maybe others can find emotional impact without that connection to whatever the objective truth is within the world of the story? or maybe they find theories compelling without regard for whether they allow us to predict the world of the story? If so, I struggle to imagine where that comes from since for me systematization is done with intent towards creating usefulness.

So that said, like the other magics I tend to take Gold Magic at face value and stop there, with meta ideas being limited to noting how it matches with the nearly-universal requirements of good stories. Powers often have costs just because it's a way to create challenge for dramatic tension. If the power lacks a drawback then the challenge in the story must come from something the power can't solve. Superman was explicitly referenced when Gold Magic was introduced, and superman, being the paragon of physical prowess, is then most strongly challenged by problems where physical force can't just instantly solve the crisis. Gold Magic provides a clever twist to that mechanic wherein the immune-to-physical-power challenge is inherent to the source of the power itself, rather than the wider plot having responsibility to provide such challenges to avoid trivializing the rest of the story. That's what makes Gold Magic an interestingly modular, working design for a story element regardless of what may have inspired the author to the design.

Could gold magic be a metaphor for an absent bread-winner parent? Sure, but it could just as easily not be. Could it be connected to dragon-hoard magic? Sure, but it could just as easily not be. Because unless I completely missed something, we could make tons of alternative metaphorical ideas. Like the demands making the gold permanently inaccessible as a resource could be a metaphor for the transience of investing wealth into improving the body as it ages, or it could just as easily not be. The requirements not to trust others to handle wealth could be a metaphorical exaggeration demonstrating how a person's respect for other people's property and in return, a person's trust in the character of others, is strained when a person has unsupervised access to the assets of someone who feels much richer. Or just as easily not. The transience of God Magic's power could be a metaphor for the religious trope that sin leads to short term gains but long term loss, or it could just as easily not be. Or a hundred other metaphorical ideas. So to me the only way any of these earn the /right/ to our head cannon's limited storage is if their competitors are excluded by future revelations of the story.

Anyway, I don't intend this to be an attack or judgement against your having the idea, and I hope you don't take it that way. Like, I know from your own story's explicit themes and author's notes that we think very differently. And that's fine; we're allowed. I'm just thinking out loud here to try to get closer to understanding where you get started from because I think there's value in being able to /correctly/ simulate other people's processes.

I, for one, unquestionably also enjoy systemization with no intent towards usefulness. This sort of super-unconstrained solving is a nice mix of an intellectual and creative problem. I mean, much of all rational fiction is fan fiction systemizing something. Does the fact that this systemization has a real, if small, chance of actually being intended by the author reduce it's funness?
