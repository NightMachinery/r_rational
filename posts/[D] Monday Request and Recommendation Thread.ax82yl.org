Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I read over the weekend the ongoing webfiction [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][Vacant Throne]] and was pleasantly impressed. It moves a little faster than I would prefer, not allowing the MC to really explore her new world. But the characters & their motivations, the magic system, and the overall plot were all a step up from most of the self-published fictions you generally find online.

Kudos to the author for improving their game over *Void Domain*, their previous work, which I dropped partway through.

** I was recently in the mood for some rational romance and finally got around to checking out [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aqwvxm/d_the_oops_better_late_than_never_romance_in/][the Valentine's r!romance thread]]. [[/u/JanusTheDoorman]] had an interesting take on why r!romance is scarce, though I don't agree that utility maximizing motivations are "inhuman" or necessarily antithetical to pursuing (emotional) satisfaction. Plus, characters like that are pretty much by definition unsatisfied with some aspect of society's status quo, but they might have a soft spot or blindspot for some social institutions.

All this is to say that I think I've got the perfect recommendation for JanusTheDoorman's request at the end:

#+begin_quote
  It'd be interesting to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are selfish and amoral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources,

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][*Birds of a Feather*]] by babylonsheep

You might know the author from his community artwork or from his previous Worm fanfiction, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/][Tabloid]], one of the best rational explorations of day-to-day cape life. I don't want to spoil anything, so let's just say Tom Riddle is a shoo-in for the selfish, amoral, rational protagonist award in this coming-of-age AU.

P.S. Great scene setting for 1930-1940s England too.

**** Never came across one, nor have I looked for that premise. It seems pretty darn hard to find a good one, since there's much less canonical material to work with during Dumbledore's 19th century school years. Also it'll probably be slash, which shares the same kind of fanfic stigma as pairing fics.

However, I assume you're at least partially interested to see the life and times of a genius in Hogwarts, so all I've got is another very canonically plausible Dumbledore during Riddle's school years. Probably my favorite depiction of Dumbledore in fanfiction, though the protagonist is still Tom.

** [[https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways][/Freeways/]] is an extremely fun game, in which the player designs highway interchanges and is scored based on (1) the average speed of traversing vehicles, (2) the amount of concrete used in construction (affected by how much roadway is present and whether the roadway is at low, medium, or high elevation), and (3) the complexity of the interchange (as measured by an algorithm that is opaque to the player). The player has a limited (but usually fairly generous) amount of concrete to complete each puzzle. Traffic inputs and outputs are not limited to the edge of the map, but may take the form of rectangles inside the map.

The game definitely isn't perfect: the lack of an undo button or an erase tool forces the player to delete the entire interchange and start the puzzle over if he makes a mistake; a long play session will leave the player's wrist aching from constantly holding down the left mouse button for the "draw roadway" function, which can't be rebound to the keyboard (compare /Minecraft/, where the "mine" function /can/ be rebound to the keyboard); and vehicles occasionally will block each other when transitioning between elevation levels when it seems they shouldn't do so. However, at $4 for a DRM-free purchase, it's a steal!

A gameplay video can be watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDlzPVXzcsU][here]]. Several animations of puzzle solutions have been posted [[https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/thread/2711773#p2720237][here]].

**** It's not.

I really like girlgenius, and I second the recommendation, it's a fun action-adventure with a complex plot and fun characters, but it isn't rational.

Off the top of my head, I can't recall anybody holding the idiot ball, but the workings of the spark are pretty opaque so you never know what's actually possible. Rationality-wise, the best that can be said is that one of the main antagonists is really well-written, coming into conflict with the protagonist out of his justified belief that it's necessary for maintaining peace in his territory.

**** The aesthetic is somewhat close to it. Characters are fairly smart, have reasonable beliefs, and mostly act based on their incentives, biases and personality. It's all very cartoonish and exaggerated (eg, it's the kind of story where the protagonists would start looking for a spy in a dinner party, except it turns out /everyone/ at the party is a spy for a different government organization), but within the bounds of the medium everyone's decision and personality makes sense.

Also, the aesthetic is pretty rational-like. This is the kind of story where the villains often say "Screw this, let's play it safe" and immediately shoots James Bond; where the protagonists will say "You know what, let's make a backup of the Giant Evil Portal Disruptor, just in case the first one fails", and otherwise makes fun of similar adventure story tropes.

Everyone gets a career class once they start working, but Artificer became more popular than Adventurer years ago. There are dungeons, but they've been sealed. There are dragons, but they were nearly hunted to extinction and now the nature preserves are well guarded. Prostitution isn't illegal, which is good, because Cinnamon Wallace likes being open about who and what she is. The gods left the world years ago, it is said that they will never return, not until all the world is dust, and the stars rain like fire from the sky. And so, when an Oracle prophesied that Cinnamon Wallace would one day meet a god, and be judged for her sins, the Oracle's words were dismissed. Surely, if the world was going to end, someone else would have also foreseen it?

I would like to recommend [[/r/JumpChain][r/JumpChain]] specifically their [[https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/58wjvc/relevant_jumpchain_links_jumps_builds_etc/][jump link page]] that has a huge list of CYOA's for various different fictions.

The premise of jump chain is that every ten years you go to new a fictional world and get to select perks and disadvantages, baced on a pre made CYOA document, for that world. As you can imagine, after a few 'jumps' if you are picking perks intelligently, your character becomes an unstoppable God and it ceases to be a challenge.

If you only take jumps on there own, or impose challenges on yourself, it can be a stimulating mental exorcise to maximize your odds of survivel. I enjoy balancing the perks and drawbacks to get the most power with the least risk and I find it fun to look at a jump after I have finished a series.

Also this [[https://i.redd.it/u4x6m9e3l3k21.jpg][picture]].

*request*

I have come to despise nigh omniscient characters in fiction as all the examples of them being used I have seen tend to cause plot holes when the don't take the actions they should to achieve there goal. Or worse were added to cover up plot holes in the worse possible way. Infinity War, Worm and The last god kubra are all examples of this to some extent.

Dose anyone have a recommendation for something containing a nigh omniscient (or something like that) used well?

EDIT: spelling.

** Any positive Warhammer 40k stories? I'm aware it's a bit of an oxymoron.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/embers-in-the-dusk-a-planetary-governor-quest-43k.10642/]] Embers In the Dark is a decent quest wherein which the players actually have a hopeful future.

**** Wait that sounds amazing! This the one? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/649448/chapters/1181375]]

How much familiarity with 40k (and the Culture) is needed?

***** I wasn't very familiar with 40k and had only read one culture book and it made sense to me. That is the one though I read it originally here: [[http://sync.in/ep/pad/view/ro.f7Ii2bq8IM01rFxsOm/latest]]

Not sure which is more complete.

** Any other great Harry Potter fanfics? Over the past few weeks, I've read HPMOR, Seventh Horcrux, and (from this thread) Birds of a Feather. Wondering if there are any other strongly recommended stories of similar quality.

*** If you were into the comedy aspect, the aptly named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] is one of my favorites.

I also really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]], though the protagonist and writing can be hit and miss for some people.

*** The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter is very good. It's AU. James and Lily give birth to a girl named Harriet who at 11 chooses to masquerade as her male "cousin", Archie Black, to attend a Hogwarts that non-Purebloods are banned from attending due to the machinations of highly successful politician Tom Riddle.

One of the main draws is that Harriet is a potions nerd and the author devotes a lot of attention to plausible academic theories and practical challenges of the subject. It doesn't take a Brandon Sanderson approach of describing all the rules in advance, but it makes you feel like there's real scientific intellectual work going on just out of sight. This is the best described magic in HP fanfic I can recall seeing.

Lots of stories have prodigies who seem more like idiots. This one has a prodigy who is genuinely smart, so it's very fun.
