** Damn, sasapariller. That's some Ace attorney stuff right there. Or was it Higurashi?

Unresolved threads in no particular order: - Randall Flagg/story jumper? - We've got two people poked and dying at the moment. Is it really the lion that's going to be revived? - Who's the narrator of Aslan's story? It's got to be the dad, yes? Deeply religious, maybe; maybe just super jaded. Presumably narrators are immune to Aslan's "Stop Time" geass, so it's nobody at the table. Also note that either Aslan can selectively turn off the geass, or people who have broken stories before (Skylar) have an easier time breaking it. - Where's Delmutt in all this(helping at the stadium)? Is the Dog about to Yoink something(doggies no like boring)? - I likes the color, but using color for Haley and regular for Sean means that the author plans to have Sean be the narrator for the majority. I wonder if there's a use case for third person.

** "I threw that debate you know" /understatement of the week/

The pink text for Haley's narration is a neat idea, although with my awful eyesight it does make it slightly harder to read. I don't know what the limits are for formatting on AO3, but might I suggest using different font styles as a substitute?

If I'm to be honest, the last couple chapters lost me on the meta-narrative thing that was going on. The explanation given to the 10 year old really helped clear up what was happening. And now I can't help picturing the Ultimate Showdown being canon in this story.

Also, what in the hell happened to Randall Flagg's narrator to make a Gold Dragon fail a constitution check? Goddamn it must suck to be that guy.

Also also, I totally called it that the dagger was going to be Aslan's demise! Looks like I can chekov at least one of my predictions as coming true! Score's now 18-1, ball's in your court, Formerly.

Also^{3}, if there's one thing I know about web serials it's that backlogs never last, so don't worry too much about trying to keep an unsustainable schedule if time conflicts prove to be a long term problem. But that's a bridge for another time I think. Rest assured we'll still be here whenever a post comes online.

Last Also, if you do find yourself in a coma, may it be of the food variety (with Freedom Day just around the corner and all).

Seeya on the next episode of +Dragon Wife+ M&M's!

Rolled a '1'. Critical fumbles still happen on saving throws.

Beings as R.F. is a monster of primordial chaos that seeks to undo all things orderly and sane, I find it as no surprise he messed up his narrator in some horrible fashion. It fits. Besides, Stephen King put himself in the Dark Tower series as a character, so its established in their own personal canon that the narrated characters can cause harm or influence the narrator. It's a bit meta, but it fits perfectly in this story with R.F. seeking out his own narrator to do terrible things to him.

** I can't see how a simple /heal/ spell doesn't fix a slit throat. It cures basically anything up to death. Maybe toss on a break enchantment to fix any curses on the dagger.

Even if there is narrative conflict, Sean is as fully in Haley's narrative as he can be, and her magic should overrule any other stories. It would be kind of bullshit narrative wise if conflicting story logic only prevents Haley from using magic on others as it is intended to work and not others from using their magic on them.

*** /Heal/ is a 6th level Divine spell, so well within the realm of Wish.

Of course, the rules on Wish *specifically state* that it can be used to bring back the dead.

Sean and Haley are still fairly low-to-medium tier munchkins, and haven't really tested their abilities to find their limits in the real world. At this point they should have already experimented by finding some roadkill or dead people or the like and tried to bring them back, both in the real world and their pocket dimension, to find out if its possible. Same with healing magics, creating simulacrums of their foes to interrogate them, divinations to locate their enemies and resources they need, etc.

From this chapter we learn that magic should work on them /just fine/ if they 'accept' her story as their own and become part of it. The only people that resist this seem to be the narrators.

**** Other fun things include making an arbitrary amount of clones as the spell in the pocket dimension. That's both biological immortality (because a clone remains in stasis and does not age, so wait 30 years and kill yourself and you de age when your soul hits the clone) and each one is a get out of death free card.

Also they should have spent a full lifetime in the new dimension. It would have taken what, a few hours real time? Then just use the clone trick to de-age Sean again, only be gets a +3 age bonus to all his mental stats too for hitting venerable, and Haley hits great wyrm level power so she can cast 9th level spells in her own right. Like time stop. Or power word - kill.

I'm imagining the look on Flagg's face when a new Sean teleports in 6 seconds later as the clone activates, and its great.

** Notes while catching up.

I have quite a weakness for dnd and dragons and litrpg with real stats, so this is right up my alley.

I'm a bit concerned with the party imbalance. The imbalance isn't just power. Haley starts out as the rational and moral one, then gets dragon body powers, dnd spells, and instant attribute and skill increases. Any one of those would be OP. Together they really do completely obsolete Sean. She even takes knowledge engineering first so he couldn't even compete if software development suddenly became relevant again. Maybe the story will just be fast paced and over before she gets super powerful? You can keep making situations where Sean is somehow relevant, but it will get more and more contrived as time goes by.

Sean seems to have misunderstood the chinese room thought experiment because he made it sound sensical.

The 'effective altruist' callout is a bit cringy. Maybe that's intentional, or maybe it's just me.

She jumps to 'It's narrative causality' really quickly with rather circumstantial evidence. What about putting those rationalist skills to work and figure out how you might test that hypothesis?

Similarly the freudian ego/id/superego is a bit of a random. Like maybe its true, but she just jumps on that explanation... I did really like the 'kill the crazy one not the sane one.'

Aslan is properly horrifying here (as he should be if you don't grant him the assumption of perfect benevolence from the start). He also seems to already have connections with hardcore merc groups. Has Aslan been in contact before the Swap?

I'm a bit concerned about the 'mega crossover' angle. In my experience they very rarely work. Too many moving parts maybe. Not clear yet how it will function in this story though.

Similarly whenever you introduce meta-narrative it gets weird. I find it emotionally disconnects me from the story and characters, and makes me generally unengaged in the events, since the story has already said the events and consequences are happening for a meta-narrative reason rather than the features of the world, and actions of the characters.

O'dim and for the tower? And working with Aslan. That's not a great sign...

He's assuming they gave the actual address of their bunker. Is that really likely?

Ooh, I'd be leery of evil spells when you don't know what metaphysics you are running on.

Oh I didn't realize Charles was the narnia kids dad. Interesting. Glad he got a moment of awesome. But... taking advice from R.F. is a bad idea.

Typos chap 17:

but there's nobody in charge ofme.I think.So,”

I can'tmakeit

Haley closed her eyes, did the math required by the feat. It reallywasludicrously easy. Thehardpart was going to be keeping me alive.“Rulethree.Youdo not threaten my husband.”

Well they can always wish for rings of 3 wishes. And he can use that (with no xp/gold cost). Not sure what would happen if he wished to be a fast maturing gold dragon.

Sure is going at a fast pace.

Not sure what great insight he has had into himself. 'Death is change?' Yeah, a particularly terrible type of change. Was he not always going to look for ways to improve himself?

Haley, at least wish up some inherent stat buffs for the poor sod. And make some contingency items of wish that are controllable by him.

"We spent some more time working around the rules, and discovered that any magical effect that applied to the weapon would work just fine. So no +5 pistols for Sherriff, but we could produce one that applied any effects to its ammunition." I don't understand. Why can't you have +5 pistols? Besides cost.

Oh, she can't age in the demiplane? Shame. She should still be able to work on her sorcery right?

"So we can't count on help there, aside from the fact that I am narrating, in some fashion, so my survival may be assumed." Err, I wouldn't bet on it if I were you.

"There may be a God, capital G, out there. Given what we know about stories I'd say it's almost a guarantee. But Aslan was never the real deal." I don't see why the stories would tell you that. The capital G is usually used to denote the three Omnis. Being part of a story would kinda preclude that.

In what way did she think she earned the power, so that she's upset to learn he gave it to her? Doesn't make sense to me.

If she can be her own narrator, she's even more OP.

The children are actually children, and he's attacking their religion half the time. Why don't they have Haley and her stratospheric stats do the debating?

Well I guess Randall understands that talking is a free action, if he can do all that before Haley can do anything. Why wouldn't he have a bunch of awesome contingency items and buffs up is the question. Maybe Randall popped an AMF silently or something?

/This/. It's been present since the beginning of the story, but is getting more pronounced as we go along, and has really ramped up now, especially since Sean is basically her 'weak spot' in /every way conceivable/. Not just emotionally, but if he dies her entire story is likely to unravel. It's rapidly appraoching the "Superman Dillema" levels where you have one super-godly character and a bunch of normies running around together, when they should clearly be tackling /completely/ different problems.

What's nonsensical about the Chinese Room thought experiment? Makes perfect sense to me. It boils down to "A sufficiently advanced program can be mistaken for sapience". Maybe it was easier to accept since I'm a Mass Effect fan and the game world is full of examples of this, called VI's.

#+begin_quote
  O'dim and for the tower
#+end_quote

I don't see Randall Flag every saying "For the tower!" in any way that isn't ironic. Considering his primary goal is to /destroy/ said Tower and undo all of existence.

#+begin_quote
  Ooh, I'd be leery of evil spells when you don't know what metaphysics you are running on.
#+end_quote

It's running on Pathfinder logic, which is heavily modified 3.X logic from the D&D days. A lot of it doesn't make sense. In theory, Infernal Healing is an 'evil' spell because its component is devil/demon blood, and thematically the spell enhances it and puts it in your body to repair it. That's roughly like saying eating meat from an evil cow is an evil act because the evil substance sates your hunger.

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand. Why can't you have +5 pistols?
#+end_quote

Because a +5 pistol gives a +5 /enhancement/ bonus to *your attack rolls*. Yes, the weapon is magical, but its giving its buff to you.

Why she doesn't have her 8 million+ simulacra cranking out fat stacks of +1 /shocking, flaming, thundering, frost, corrosive, dry load, phantom, Bane/ (of each creature type seperately) ammunition is beyond me. Bane ammo makes you 10% more likely to hit, does more bonus damage than any two other damage mods, and ignores all the damage resistances (but not immunities) of the foe. It'd be messy carrying ammo of different Bane types for different creatures, but I'm *pretty sure* Magical Beast (Aslan) and Outsider-bane (Randall) weapons would work really well right about now. Humanoid (Human) would probably be the most common, though. Being able to fire them underwater or in a vacuum, while also doing a little of each of the elemental types of damage (letting you see what the target resists and is weak against) seem like very handy additions.

Nor why those pistoles aren't of the /distance, ghost touch, glamered, impervious, merciful, plummeting, seeking, shadowshooting, silencing, and veering/ variety. They would have extended range attacks that can optionally not kill the target, hit things that are ghostly or not fully in our dimension, knock flying enemies out of the sky, ignore cover and concealment for the purposes of hitting things, make no sounds when they fire, can create their own quasi-real ammo, and appear to be any object of similar size that the wielder desires--an illusion that goes away when they are used to attack.

I know the writer doesn't want them to munchkin too bad, but I /really/ can't understand why those pistols don't have /Merficful/ on them, given Sean's nature. He'd have guns that can blow up objects but would be able to shoot someone unconscious rather than kill them--something he could turn off if he needed lethal attacks. Combined with the Phantom ammo, eh could literally shoot someone into unconsciousness and they'd have no wounds or bruises from the ordeal. I also don't know why /Seeking/ (ignores concealment) and /Veering/ (ignores cover) aren't on there, either. Even being able to see a creature's pinky toe behind a bush or sticking out around a corner would let him shoot them as if they were standing in the middle of an empty street. Combined with Sheriff's skill at weapons, he'd practically be a Roland Deschain clone, able to shoot entire /towns/ of people, but not actually have to kill them in the process. Only things with obscene amounts of health (fully grown dragons, for instance) would be able to tank that for long enough to stop him.

Of course, this gets back to the power disparity bit. The power disparity /has/ to be intentional, otherwise we'd likely see stuff like this.

The chinese room thought experiment is supposed to be proof that AI's can't really think. That they can't have understanding (unlike humans).

Our logic says that there's no reason Infernal Healing should be actually evil, but pathfinder metaphysics says it is capital E Evil. They haven't really mapped out how pathfinder and real life logic interact (eg have they tested if the squareroot of 2 is 1.5?) So I would be very leery of using something that is specifically called out as being Metaphysically Evil, even, or especially, if I can't understand why.

I'm not sure why he would say that a +5 pistol is enchanting the user to make them more skillful instead of simply being a much better weapon, as that isn't stated or implied in the rules (iirc). Things that buff a creature will simply say so. For instance a masterwork weapon has a +1 bonus to hit (just like a magic +1 weapon), but is clearly not enchanting the user, just the weapon being of high quality.

#+begin_quote
  Nor why those pistoles aren't of the distance, ghost touch, glamered, impervious, merciful, plummeting, seeking, shadowshooting, silencing, and veering variety.
#+end_quote

I get the impression they haven't actually started crafting at super speed in the demiplane so are limited to 25kgp. Doesn't really make sense though. You do need a base +1 so can't fit quite all of those on.

He can also just equip thousands of contingent items, that are contingencies to go off when he twitches his thumb or whatever. That's assuming that standard push a button magic items don't work for him for some strange reason. Get some traps to reapply his buffstack at the necessary intervals and he's at least moderately competitive. I guess pathfinder removed polymorph, but did they remove all the ways to mind switch (depends on how many splat books you allow)? Gate in something awesome and do a true mind switch. There are lots of ways to make Sean awesome, though admittedly not quite as awsome as Haley.

Seems like the author doesn't want them to be complete munchkins, just paddle in the shallow end. Really though, once the author allowed infinite wish loop, the, err, genie was out of the bag, so might as well go for broke. I'm guessing it doesn't really matter since he's having stories fight at the level of narrative, not straight mechanical power.

The issue of imbalance is even worse here, since Haley is super intelligent, wise, and charismatic. Why would Sean be the point man in the trial? Why would he come up with the plan, and Haley not be able to think of a better one?

Not so much contrived as /necessary/. They pretty much have to split to handle problems that they are able to handle, because having them together means one of them is always in dire danger of death or the other is just bored as problems are handled with a snap of the fingers.

#+end_quote

I don't see how it's proof they can't think at all. The primary difference between an AI and a VI/Chinese Room is self-awareness, ie: sapience. The secondary difference, derived from the primary, is that an AI can modify its own behavior, something that the Chinese Room can't do. You can't both fake self-awareness and consciously modify your own behavior. If the machine is capable of doing both, it /is/ actually self aware and sapient.

My personal belief is that AI can't be created directly, but starts in a VI-like state that has to achieve full AI status through adaptive learning and processing of sufficient input. But that's neither here nor there.

Why? Only Pathfinder's metaphysical good or spells/abilities that target said Evil would apply. Since there aren't any of those that aren't controlled by Sean's story, then there is no threat.

#+end_quote

You make the attack roll. The weapon doesn't make the attack. Like in the real world, guns don't kill people, people kill people easier using guns. You the player roll the die, and add the stat's that your character has to add to it: BAB, Dex modifier, all sorts of various other mods including luck, competence, etc, etc, and /enhancement/ bonuses. The weapon enhances your roll.

If it makes you feel any better, I offer a second explanation: Sean is not a Pathfinder character. He /doesn't have an attack roll to modify/.

#+begin_quote
  but is clearly not enchanting the user, just the weapon being of high quality.
#+end_quote

I never said that it enchanted the user. I said it applies a bonus to the /user's attack rolls/. It has nothing to do with magic. If the weapon somehow granted the *Weapon Focus* Feat to the user for its own attacks, then Sean would still not get that bonus. If it offered a /luck/ or /competence/ bonus somehow, it still would not work for him.

#+begin_quote
  Even if they are acting limited by 25000gp they can get a lot if you enchant a single ammunition with that.
#+end_quote

You don't wish for the item. You wish for the materials to /create/ the item. "I wish for the equivalent of 25,000 GP in materials that are a suitable contribution toward the end goal of crafting a /+10 pistol/." Repeat as necessary.

Don't have the crafting feat? Make a custom item that grants you the feat. Worried about XP? She's passively generating a lot of self-XP over time simply by existing for some reason. Use it.

#+begin_quote
  You do need a base +1 so can't fit quite all of those on.
#+end_quote

At least two of those mods are a flat +GP value, not a +1 bonus. And you can 'upgrade' items with the crafting rules. They don't have to be crafted or wished for all in one go, although it would help to create the 'base' form (the equivalent of a +3, which makes 18,000 GP worth, and whatever other flat +GP cost mods will fit) with the Wish and then add to that.

Oh, it takes time? Demiplane. Oh, the rules say you have to compare it to real world time? Make four pistols, give him two now, have Simulacra working on the other two ultimate weapons. *NOTE*: The Author might actually have those going on in the background.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They didn't so much remove it as 'nerf it from its godly broken state'. As it is, the Mind Switch must be able to affect the targets, so again it needs to be part of Seans story or those who are directly opposing Haley... and I'm not sure I'd want to give my enemies a dragon body. As Sean is the Narrator of it, I doubt they'd work on him.

#+begin_quote
  Why would Sean be the point man in the trial?

Why bother indulging in their story at all? Pathfinder is all about a collection of plucky heroes rising up against tyrants and overthrowing them, saving their world from destruction. Make it the /Pathfinder/ story, not the /Narnia/ story.
