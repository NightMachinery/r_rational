Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I've been toying with one idea for some time. 'Eldritch computers'.

First, [[http://imgur.com/gallery/zBtoQ][inspiration]]. Slightly more [[http://windows95tips.com/page/4][there]].

The driving idea was: come up with devices which could plausibly actually behave this way, postulate further that the devices are widely distributed, then figure out how the rest of the world must look like. The result:

Imagine a Lovecraftian world full of eldritch beings. Simply /existing/ there as a human is dangerous. Hordes of inhuman abominations would torment you, eat you, erase you, mindrape you, inflict a fate worse than death on you, propagate through you, etc., etc.

Despite that, a high-tech human civilization exists there. The safety of its citizens is ensured by technomagical 'eldritch computers'. ^{/It's never safe to turn off your PC./}

They're capable of mostly everything our modern PCs are capable of. In addition to that, they work as autonomous wards, i.e. protect people's apartments from eldritch beings. They detect incrusions, try to stop them; give suggestions to the humans when an incrusion is happening. Offer ways to fight back. They have supernatural abilities/functions which their owners could use. Hardware for sacrifical rituals is among them. They have magical control over their owner(s), which the owner could use to manipulate his/her perceptions, memories, emotions...

Naturally, given the setting, they're quite scary themselves. They're partially organic. They /grow/ organic parts as needed. They make eerie remarks. They may or may not be sentient. Ordinary, non-specialist people don't know what they even /are/, exactly. They could easily suggest doing something horrible like cutting off your hand and sacrificing it to stop a demon attack. They could /do/ something horrible, such as turning off your emotions or paralyzing you in a dangerous situation, going as far as destructively uploading you, sending you off to another city, then detonating the tactical nuke embedded into them to prevent an Outer God's invasion into this reality. So on.

Questions to consider:

How were the eldritch computers developed/found/summoned? How they defend people: do they constantly and automatically perform highly-complex warding rituals, or do they lend their computational power to Yog-Sothoth in exchange for protection? What exact functions they have? How would people view them? How would a programmer's job look like? How would programmers/engineers be viewed? What shape the society would take?

Or whatever else you may find interesting to do with the idea.

*** I'd imagine that the process of Eldritch incursion was a pretty slow one. As each new being started to interact with reality, ancient societies figured out rituals to prevent some/most of their influence. As time passed and technology progressed, more and more eldritch beings started to converge on the universe. Eventually the sheer number of beings and the complexity of rituals involved grew to the point where nobody could know and perform all of them consistently enough to defend themselves. Enter Windows 95, which uses the tortured collective souls of all the previous ritualists to make everyone who installs it a master ritualist.

*** There's some Mythos lore from [[http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/gods-teeth-a-delta-green-campaign/][RPPR's Delta Green campaign God's Teeth]] that could be useful here. For the game, they introduce a new aspect of Bast called Sredni Vashtar, based on the short story of the same name, which represents animalistic predators and feeds on other parts of the Mythos. It's powers and servants can be, and are in the game, utilized to defend humanity so long as you keep feeding it like a tamed wolf. Don't expect to housebreak it, though.

There are extreme downsides, of course. Only pre-lingual people can communicate with Sredni Vashtar, since it's based it totemic and atavistic rituals, and the way it's summoned in the game is by abused children who haven't been taught to speak so they couldn't call for help. In addition, it hungers for anything that's been touched by the Mythos, including victims of it. If you don't want to listen to the game, even though you should, you can get a summary from their [[http://slangdesign.com/rppr/2016/09/podcast-episode/rppr-episode-133-gods-teeth-campaign-post-mortem/][post mortem discussion]].

*** Perhaps once, the only way humanity could survive in this dark mirror of our universe was as slaves to dark lords, destined to have children and then be immediately sacrificed in unspeakable rites to protect the next generation from the horrors in the sky.

Then came the Enlightenment, a ritual where some of the most mad of the dark lords, such as Descartes, Bacon and Newton, trapped a minor god of chaos in a maze, leaving a measure of order in it's place. From that order came the Thaumo-Industrial Revolution, which made it possible, for the first time, for humanity to survive without the mass sacrifices. Instead, people could be sent to factories, where their bodies and souls could be modified on the assembly line to be strong enough to survive some of the eldritch horrors.

With the invention of computers and mass-spellcraft in the '80s, that process became largely automated and decentralized. For the first time, humanity began to find a measure of peace. Songs and movies were created for no purpose other than entertainment, and the Dominion of Washington Immortal saw it's average life expectancy rise above 30.

Then, in 1995, Kurzweil and the burgeoning Cult of the Singularity did /something/, and computers haven't quite worked properly since.

*** This makes me think of something like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokethulhu][Pokethulu]] with a mass produced [[http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Porygon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)][Porygon]] equivalent. It could also be something like [[http://bogleech.com/mortasheen.htm][Mortasheen]] with a larger emphasis on electronics.
