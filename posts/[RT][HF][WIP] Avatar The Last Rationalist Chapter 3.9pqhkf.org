Thanks for reading if you do so and please review if you can.


** Alright, I skimmed all three chapters. Some feedback:

- First off, I don't know if you're going to get a lot of attention here with this story. "Character from the real world gets swapped with main character from this series (and also gets convenient vision giving him background info)" is a really fanfic-y kind of story that most people aren't really interested in. You might get more interest from a forum like Spacebattles, except /these/ guys hate rationalist branding and your fanfic has a lot of that.

- The first half of chapter 2 is almost nothing but the intro of /The Last Airbender/ in prose form. This is the kind of stuff you normally want to get past as fast as you can so you can get in the meat of the action (if you don't just start /in media res/).

- You really need to use commas in your sentences. For instance, "Fishing was all about patience something Sokka knew Katara could never understand" should be "Fishing was all about patience, something Sokka knew Katara could never understand". As it is, some paragraphs are flat out unreadable.

Overall, aside from the fact that I'm really not in the initial concept (Avatar is a setting that really doesn't need portal fantasy stories), it looks like you just need to get better at writing. I don't really have the skills or the technical know-how to give you advice, but in general I think you need more direction. Like, ideally, each scene needs to have a purpose, information or emotions it wants to convey, and deliver them in as few words as possible. I didn't really get this impression from reading your fic.

** You should really have a description, especially on ff.net. Many people need more to go on to read something other than knowing that this story involves rationality and is set in the A:tLE universe.

Look at HPMoR's for example:

#+begin_quote
  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell.
#+end_quote

It doesn't spoiler much but it at least gives you an idea of what you're reading before having to actually invest time.

*** I suppose you're right. I was planning on not interracting with readers because of later plot developments. I'll change it now. Thanks!

** read the first chapter until after Dr snow and the woman leaves and have some feedback if your interested:

To cut strait to the chase, basically; it's boring. The writing itself is good and it's only the 'story plan' that needs work on, and in very subtle non obvious ways.

You would think that it would be interesting, there is action, intrigue, interesting and well written characters, but its missing the core that puts it together, and I'll try explain what that seems like to me as best i can:

- You don't know the rules of the world. So it starts off as if the avatar reincarnated into some kid, but then you see its just a normal world, and then out of nowhere come some supernatural people hinting they know about his avatar powers. All these things are so... random. You try to instill some context in the world and then break it immediately, it just gives the reader a sense of confusion, not understanding what is going on and that detaches their interest from the story, making them not care about the characters, intrigue or action. Pretty much the whole time I was reading i was thinking 'when is there going to be some explanation' until i dropped it.

- The MC is not relatable. I tend to not like this criticism, because he doesn't need to be, but i can't think of a better way to explain it. We jump through his life too fast, it all seems pointless and like useless information, a better way to do that (if you really want to) is flashbacks, a good example being WOC. If WOC went through all the flashbacks first, and only then to dropping down, with the basic world's rules explained to us within the first few paragraphs, no one would have got to that point.

- Too many changes to the world. One pitfall I see in a lot of stories is adding too many random things to the world that doesn't necessarily push the story forward. I guess its kind of more like: either change it all or none of it. Establishing an earth like world with one supernatural difference, then adding a second out of nowhere and so on causes the same problem as the first point. Even if you explain it later, at the time it is just confusing.

I think this is why the commenter below wanted a summary. So he could know whether its what he enjoys and if its worth continuing. Hope this helps.

** I agree with [[/u/Dragfie]], the intro is long and confusing. It took me a while to get through it, and I almost gave up. I'm glad I didn't, because the rest shows promise.

Unsolicited advice - trim the prelude to just the last few paragraphs. Let the woman in white be a mystery that is slowly revealed thru flashbacks or dreams or something. The prelude will then let the reader know who/what Arthur is, some mysterious background info, and where the next chapter will pick up.

The rest is fairly decent, and I hope it goes somewhere good.
