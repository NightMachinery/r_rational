Hi [[/r/rational]], I hope you all don't mind that I'm self promoting my new story called [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37438/salvos][Salvos]] here. It's a litrpg evolution story about a Demon, following her from her birth as she grows and learns more about the world and how everything works. The twist is... there really is no twist. She's just a survivor.

#+begin_quote
  Salvos knew she was different from the moment she was born. She was indomitable. She was curious. She was always longing for more.

  When faced with adversity, she would never fold. When met with something new, she would always learn. And when she crested to the top, reaching where none had ever reached, she would never be simply content.

  But that was not why she was special. There were others in the Netherworld--- other Demons amidst the mindless masses who behaved like her, who thought like her, and who had an endless craving to evolve like her.

  And yet, she still stood apart from them. She was still special.

  Why?

  Because she was a survivor.

  -----

  Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias that can lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence.

  Now the question is: why do some survive where others just as capable as them fail?

  Is it hard work? Is it destiny? Or is it just chance?

  ...does it really matter?

  Salvos is a story about action, adventure, and evolution. It follows a Demon's journey from her birth and onwards as she grows and gains experience from encountering new things through the various lenses of her life.

The origins for the premise of the story stems from me watching sports interviews and hearing the responses most athletes give when asked why they would win. "I'm built different", "I train hard every day", or even "it's because of god"/"I'm destined for greatness". At the top level of sports, everyone is 'built different', everyone 'trains hard', and everyone believes the world 'wants' them to be at the top. And it's the same thing whenever a billionaire says that as long as you persevere, you'll become a billionaire eventually-- that's the most commonly used example for survivorship bias. I just used the sports example because it's never brought up in sports, and honestly, hearing the same thing over and over again in every interview makes me lose my mind a little /tiny/ bit. Sorry for the rant lol

Of course, this is something that will not be explored immediately, nor will it ever be fully in the fore beyond the subtext. The main focus of the story will be the growing motivations and reasonings of a creature that is born fully sapient but with no understanding of how the world works. And the world-- or the Netherworld-- is a chaotic place with no laws and no morality.

The only thing governing her actions is her basic instinct to want to evolve, her curiosity of the world at large due to her nature as a fully thinking being, and her... well, /pride/ that comes from seeking to be acknowledged as a subject in the world, and not just any ordinary object. And that last bit gets extremely difficult when you're simply treated as a means to gain experience to level and evolve from. Especially since she starts off with no language. The ability to communicate is one of the most important aspects of recognition, after all.

I'm not exactly certain if this is a /fully/ rationalist fiction, but it does appear to fit into Aspiring Rationalism, which is why I'm promoting it here on this sub. I hope you guys give it a shot! It's my second ever written story, so it might not be the best, but I have very much enjoyed writing it so far!


** Your rant about survivor bias is pretty interesting and it relates to psychological studies done on the effects of luck. People who are very lucky develop a very similar mindset to those who were born to privilege. They forgot that others don't have the same resources or chances, and start thinking that either there's something wrong with other people or they're just better.

They got the lucky break because they deserved it and not others. Luck can erode empathy.

Someone online made an analogy using Joy from Inside-Out about this. She's very peppy and happy to share her cheer with others, but she just basically bullies Sadness. It's not out of malice, she just doesn't have the empathy to understand what it's like to not be lucky or constantly happy. Her "life" was too charmed that it blots out other's misfortune.

It can even show up in minor ways. Finding a quarter on the floor can lead to people thinking there is a higher chance an attractive individual is flirting with them minutes later.

This effect is magnified in the individuals who are at the far extreme of the bell curve in being lucky.

*** That's very interesting! I never knew that before. Although I do wonder why there's a need to distinguish luck and being born to privilege; isn't being born to privilege an extension of luck?

**** The distinction matters, because while being privileged is being lucky, being lucky doesn't mean being privileged. And all of the effects I mentioned still holds if someone is lucky without being privileged.

** You really should include the part about survivor ship bias in the rr description.

I clicked your story once in the past and then clicked away, because it sounded too similar to absurd current project.

But the part about the bias really caught attention and now will give it a try.

*** Thanks! Yeah, I'm just trying out different blurbs, seeing which attracts the most readers. So far, the one about survivorship bias seems to have the most success. But I might do a poll on it soon, just to let my readers decide since I'm indecisive XD

** I've been reading Salvos for awhile, and I will say that it's quite well written and the story is interesting. It is interesting watching the MC essentially build themselves up from nothing, and figuring out who - and what - she is and how she fits into the world.

About the survivor bias: I definitely agree here. The story does a pretty good job of showing that those who survive manage largely though luck. Everyone we see is born equal, and they only manage to grow at the expense of others they start out with equal stats, and kill others to gain XP. Sometimes fights are won either because the one side is smarter or opponent is weaker, sometimes it's because it's just a bad match-up.

You really took that to heart. Not that I disagree.

*** Haha thanks. You're the guy who wrote the long post on RR, right? I liked that comment.

Honestly though, that was actually something I considered from the start, since I had just finished reading Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirits for Uni when I began Salvos, and Hegel makes language/communication out to be an important tool against alienation and attaining recognition. The only problem is I'm a pantster, so sometimes I write things that is probably better saved for a later payoff time, which I'm glad you pointed out.

** I read your story after seeing this post but I'm not sure if I plan to continue.

In the latest chapter(8) Salvos was able to kill a demon a whole evolution level above her without any advanced preparation. Her winning strategy doesn't use any of her established Skills. And it requires her in an Agility vs Agility contest against a higher level Agility focused opponent (the hell hound's only skill is a speed boost, it's Agility focused). And she scores a critical win despite needing to perform an insanely complicated aerial manoeuvrer with no actual abilities to maneuver in the air against an opponent who only needs to step to the side.

Meanwhile the hellhound makes every possible mistake. It mostly ignores the DPS to focus on the tank, despite the tank not having any Skills to draw aggro and Salvos repeatedly attacking it. It seems to have only one Skill despite the protagonist having two a whole evolution level earlier. It charged straight into the spear despite the fact it logically could see it (dogs are taller than larvae: Salvos' limbs are described as "nubby protrusions" while the hellhound has proper legs. Also Salvos is short enough to fit underneath the spear). Then when the spear is falling it chooses to growl rather than take a step to the side and dodge it.

This doesn't feel like aspiring rationalism or a plausible rpg mechanic, it feels like plot armour where regardless of established numbers the protagonist will always scrape out a way to win.

*** Heya, thanks for giving Salvos a shot.

I tried making Salvos as resourceful as possible in that fight which gave her the win over the wild Demon [Hellhound], but it appears I might have let rule of cool take control somewhere in the middle of it.

** Pretty good so far. I think the blurb about survivorship bias is pretty useful context; without it I would have interpreted a lot of the story in a different light. But, if you do plan to explore those themes more explicitly in the future, then that might arguably be a good thing in that it allows it to be a 'twist' of sorts.
