[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a3kagk/biweekly_challenge_punishment/][Last time]] the prompt was "Punishment". Our winner is [[/u/conradin6622]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a3kagk/biweekly_challenge_punishment/ebkdjnn/]["Where the Water Comes From"]]. Congratulations to [[/u/conradin6622]]! (And my apologies for the delay.)

** This Time

   :END:
This time, the challenge will be *Flaws*. It's a more open-ended one, but the kernel of the idea comes from looking at corner cases where systems tend to fail, or the way that we attempt to fix aspects of ourselves that are broken, or the ways in which simulations sometimes don't map to reality. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, January 16th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *Endings*. Sometimes things come to an end, slowly or quickly, with or without forewarning. Your challenge is to write an ending, either with a whole story that can be inferred from the text of the ending, as a play on a traditional plot that the audience will be assumed to be familiar with, or as an alternate ending to an existing work. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit. *This will be the last challenge.*

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 1/16*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/acesg0/challenge_companion_flaws/?][is available here]].
