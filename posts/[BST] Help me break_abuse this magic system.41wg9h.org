** To split the axes a little more bluntly:

- *Love:* Pacifist endurance
- *Hate:* Violent endurance
- *Fear:* Reactive precognition
- *Hope:* Proactive precognition
- *Joy:* Super-speed (distance)
- *Sorrow:* Super-speed (time)

I think this is good, though I'm not so sure about the Love/Hate split, since you're including violence as a feedback and it's already an emotion-based system and those seem like they'd be baked in. So I think I would go back to look at "endurance" and see if you can find a better way to split those; perhaps hate is endurance via regeneration while love is endurance via shielding?

I'm also not sure about putting limits on who can use what, since that seems like it's also baked into an emotional system. The only people who can use an emotion are people who strongly feel that emotion, emotions fade with time, you're already at the right limits.

For some meat, I think you need to consider drugs. Take a dose of something that induces extreme paranoia, get reactive precognition. Take a dose of something that induces psychotic rage, get extreme endurance. Take ecstasy, get super-speed. But I'm not sure that you want to go in this direction, nor am I sure that it's sufficiently awesome.

The most powerful people are those who are least emotionally stable, which is interesting, as those people are probably also the easiest to manipulate (cowards, hotheads, etc.). The burnout factor blunts this somewhat though.

As for meat ... what you want in a story is a driver of conflict, and ideally you also want something cool and splashy. I think given your framework, one of my solutions would be emotional clades, groups that all focus on a single emotion that they can reinforce within each other. It's easier to be joyful when people around you are joyful. It's easier to feel hate when you're within a culture of hate. This doesn't preclude anyone from forming their own group of mixed emotions, but it does provide some instant tensions. The gang of hatemongers all wearing red get pissed off when the yellow-dressed joyweavers come walking by, because it's a direct affront to the emotion they're trying to cultivate.

  if overused, it can numb one entirely - someone that keeps using anger to fight would eventually be unable to get angry anymore, and so on. [interesting consequences of this are especially appreciated]
#+end_quote

I suggest instead, maybe keep emotions normal and human (sensitizing or desensitizing as normal humans would) but balance overuse and or overpowered variants via negative effects in keeping with the cognitive biases they create.

Love should be an exception, gets stronger with greater use time. But, love may cause /other/ emotions to go haywire - not magically, just because the actor is human (like you might get too much anger if someone hurts a loved one, or too much fear that they will get hurt, or too much joy from being together) and this makes it the most dangerous to use of all. False versions of love - clingyness, infatuation, etc - may create a lethally inaccurate /perception/ of invincibility. You have to

Too much anger, like love, has no /magical/ drawback - it is it's own punishment. via causing excessive violence.

Too much fear causes reactive precognition to very minor threats that could have been safely ignored or returns visions of events that have only a very low probability of occurring, losing predictive value.

too much continuous sadness leaves you trapped in an extremely still, unmoving, isolated sad world which cannot move on, till you go insane or fade away due to the physical weakness effect.

Too much joy and you start going too fast to control, making it easy to get ahead of yourself and accidentally kill yourself.

Hope in inappropriate, truly hopeless situations causes the precognition solution to be extremely unlikely to work (the precognition scramble to find /some/ solution, however unlikely).

Nice side effect of this is that emotions will be synergistic in a manner which imitates life.

Joy + love + hope (positive triad) = you're going fast, but physical endurance of love prevents you from injuring yourself, and hope gives you precognition to help you control your speedy body.

Anger + sadness + fear (negative triad) = slow down time, but the physical weakening is canceled out by Anger, and fear keeps you extra safe.

Joy + fear (thrill, exhilaration like a roller coaster) = going fast, with precognition to avoid crashing into things.

Joy + anger (bloodlust) = Superspeeded violent maniac slaughters everyone, physical endurance bonus prevents self-injury

Joy + sadness (nostalgia) = creates moments that last forever - often happens when your kids are getting married, etc. Time slows down but you speed up, so you move normally to your own perception even while everything stops. If you share the moment with someone it's extra fun. Very powerful in other contexts if you manage to trigger it.

** Random ideas:

For different 'users', you could have states that are difficult to access because they require a certain amount of training to access reliably. These wouldn't be more powerful, necessarily, just more obscure because of the time/expertise required.

Examples:

1. *Clear-headed relaxation/calmness*- hard to describe, but if you've ever meditated, its that really calm but alert feeling you have right after meditation. Maybe this could give you a certain degree of blanket immunity to damage while removing your ability to deal damage. Like you're 1/4 as capable fo doing 'damage' but are only affected by 1/4 of the damage you'd normally receive.

2. The prototypical *'mystical' experience* William James (and many others) wrote about, variously described as transcendent, euphorically happy, a dissolving of self, etc.

   Maybe it gives you a short-lived powerful 'Master' ability where you have massively boosted empathy and reading of people around you. So you could predict their attacks or words but you'd feel so much empathy for them that you'd have to be quite detached or strong-willed to actually harm people while in this state.

3. *Extreme focus/obsession*-- I've had this when sober, but to explain simply: the hyperfocus you get while on amphetamines or other stimulants. The resulting power would give you better senses and intuition regarding your object of focus. A resulting disadvantage would be a corresponding lack of attention to everything but that object. So if I 'pull' focus and think about someone I want to kill in fight, I'd have a sense of their weak points, their location, etc. but also become numb to what's going on around me.

Maybe instead of overuse causing permanent numbing (too bleak to me, personally) it causes a corresponding weakness that last for a disproportionate amount of time? Someone who pulls love for too long or too hard will be weaker for a couple of days. etc.

** I love this. The bonus effect - that you numb yourself to that emotion - is amazing. It's neither clearly a downside nor clearly an upside. You'll have groups of people for whom that is the primary effect of magic, /not/ the actual magic.

That said - it's unclear what the "numbed" emotional state of someone is. If I have no hope, do I have despair, or fatalistic apathy?

I think you've also got a population that reversibly Vulcan's themselves. Cognitive traditions (like, say, memory palaces) would develop to deal with numbed states, as well as to induce emotion for specific states.

Historical note: Has magic always been around?

More thinking is required. I don't like the pain-as-enchanting aspect; it's too clearly "good/bad". I love using magic for science and operating machinery!

I like the idea of the magic working in direct proportion to the emotional mix you're feeling. I don't think it's overpowered.

You have a hugely effective self-balancer in that a) legit emotion is literally mana (big effect for big numb, long effect for long numb) and b) your most effective mages will be seriously emotional people.

Also, group ritual casting? Theater and symphonies. Hot /damn/.

**** Emotions are complicated and weird. For example, although depression is commonly thought of as /sadness/, it is actually (according to Things I Have Read) a lack of energy with which to feel things. AFAIK, this is why antidepressents lead to suicides - depression and sadness, while not the same, do tend to occur in the same situations, so pumping people who feel bad all the time but have to where-with-all to do anything with energy... Yeah. You get them to do something.

** [With changes to the system. Also, imagine a properly alchemical language and style. Also also, clearly this theory is all wrong in some way, because all theories are!]

The Theorem of The Equilibric Universe: As within, without

We know from the art of engines the principle of /thermodynamic conservation/ - that is, that all power arises from a thing being separated from it's natural state. Water raised, temperatures outside of norm, fuels unburned, so on and so forth. Work, the /purpose/ of energy, is then done by diverting the course of the universe's re-alignment to equilibrium. The falling of water powering the water wheel being our most observable example.

As such, when looking at the magical arts, we can observe the same: the human heart, reaching a state of /disequilibria/, has /created/ energy, and the human soul, alone in the world in it's singular ability to enact /magic/, may extract work from this disquilibria in the course of equalizing.

As to the notable effect of /selective depression/, by which the magi becomes /numb/ or otherwise /subdued in an emotion/, we can liken it to the effort required to once again raise the fallen water to a height. A thing that naturally occurs, as the cycle of precipitation, but nonetheless one which takes /time/.

Now, to our main point of discussion, the emotions of Eurasia*, which we divide into the six humors:

Fear: Fear arises from what could be that is not desired. The Universe works to Equalize your soul by showing you that which can occur that you might make it /not/ occur. Fear equalizes to /fatalism/ - the one cannot change one's future, and with it, calm.

Hope: Hope arises from what could be that /is/ desired, and equalizes to /ennui/. As one knows the path to victory, one knows both how reachable and unnatianable it is, and with it, calm.

Sadness: Sadnessess arises from things that are that are not desired. The Universe works to Equalize your soul by giving you time in which to accept the state of the world. Sadness equalizes to melancholy. As one is able to contemplate their woes, they are able to consider how things could be worse, and that they are not.

*Researcher's Note: Just as having words that describe colors gives you the abililty to see those colors, so too does having words to describe emotions give the ability to feel them. However, it is more pronounced - the stories that one learns as a child, which then inform them as to the emotions one may feel, have the strongest effect. As such, the peoples of the Indies conduct subtley different Magicks as befits their different emotions.

--------------

This is an "eh" stab at what jumped out at me. Another compelling set up is to have a cycle - love leads to anger, anger leads to fear, fear leads to hope, hope to joy, joy to sadness, sadness to love.... Potentially, both could work in the same world, depending on how your character's cultures promote what makes you feel this or that. Either way, however, having some principle that explains why each emotion leads to the magic that it does would be very helpful - except then you pick one (or more, or in parts) to break that rule to some degree because theories are always wrong and in the early days it was easy to spot exceptions.

** Does it get easier to channel love if you are numb to anger? Because if you can use any five of the emotions just enough to feel numb to them, then the ability to solely focus on the remaining emotion should be dramatically magnified thus enhancing the power of that one emotion.

** How hard is pulling? Can it be done accidentally? Because as an avid minecraft player my mind already has some intricate baby farms designed.

Plus once you've extracted all the emotions for material goods, I'm guessing they'll be very pliable. You could leave a bit of love in there, get them some dogma, a nice Big Brother figure, and form the perfect loyal army.

Actually, forget babies. Even in the least forgiving interpretation of the rules you could teach them to pull early, say at four, and hold sessions to help rid them of those filthy, filthy bad emotions as early as possible. Apply drugs as needed.

And regardless of any of that, You have posited a world where people can remove certain emotions from their lives permanently. Surely there will be some strange social or religious groups that focus on that.

** u/CCC_037:
#+begin_quote
  Geniuses can be made to separate from a person and attach to an object when the person experiences enormous amounts of pain. It attaches to an object that's core to the pain (i.e if you're getting tortured, then it would attach to, say, a knife or something).
#+end_quote

...this is /begging/ for a Villain to kidnap people, torture them to get their Genius out, kill them, and keep the new magic item. Either to sell for massive amounts of money to his black market connections, or to keep for himself. (And he keeps enough for himself to be a near-completely undefeatable fighter - Fear goggles that let him see danger at /any time/, activatable Anger armour that keeps him safe... that sort of thing. With the downside, of course, that every such piece of equipment is an actual torture implement and he's wearing them all...).

It's /also/ begging for a character to sacrifice his own Genius to give the Hero a Hope weapon at some point - a weapon that shows you the optimal way to use it (whether "optimal" means "allow me to survive this conflict" or "kill my opponent" makes an interesting dichotomy - it may be that only one of the above is possible).

Actually, if a Villain tortures someone with his bare hands, can he get a second Genius for himself, thus allowing him access to vastly more powerful and/or versatile magic, perhaps tapping more easily into two emotions at once?

--------------

Here's another thought - what happens if you have /no/ emotion, if your Genius is completely blank? Could that possibly open up a (very rare, virtually unknown) "invisibility" power, which allows you to take actions unpredicted and unpredictable by Fear and Hope (but not necessarily /actually/ making you invisible)? This leads inevitably to thinking of a very zen assassin who specialises in killing people with threat-spotting Fear goggles...

It's also begging for a scene where someone sacrifices their genius

** Employers would like their workers to be happy, and would like them to spend that joy and love being faster, stronger, more resilient and more effective. Those interested in short-term workers will be happy to burn them out, those looking for the long term will have methods developed to find a sustainable pace.

Soldiers and law enforcement will go out of their way to fight their opposition in a calm, predictable way. They must be stoic and relentless, to discourage Hope, but also gentle and fair to discourage Anger, Fear and Sadness. Again, Joy and Love are the greatest weapons in this regard.

A savvy criminal mastermind, then, will want to focus on Hope or Fear. The former would probably be inspired by confidence in the leader's ability to out-think the law. The latter would be inspired by the leader selling the very real dangers of the law's effectiveness. Fear is easiest, but necessarily short term: It breaks confidence even as it builds power. Hope requires more work (and skill) but will pay longer term benefits.

That gang leader will also, by the by, want to be just as polite, stoic, calm, and reasonable as his opponents... for the same reasons.

Also, getting discouraged in order to work through an intellectual dilemma is probably going to be a thing. /Work/ that sadness. Physical weakness isn't a big hassle in most of our everyday lives.

MEAT: The bit about Love requiring focus is a very solid limitation, rich with storytelling and motivational potential. Try to incorporate that into the other emotions. Purity of emotion based on specificity rather than a nebulous "strength". What outcome, exactly, do you Fear? What is the most poignant single source of your Sadness? Which specific aspect of their person inspires your Love?

Lots of great story hooks there, as well as establishing intriguing limitations. The most powerful pathomancers would all have a specific focus that, once known, could be attacked (physically or rhetorically). Weaker, less focused emotion would get less impressive results but be significantly more difficult to unwind.

Ya know, if you want to make this rationalist, there's a variety of cognitive benefits to the various emotions.

For instance, sadness reduces or eliminates several important [[http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/four_ways_sadness_may_be_good_for_you][cognitive biases]], and I expect this generalizes. (Those emotions evolved for a reason!)

** It feels to me like this system would likely result in, effectively, monastic orders of powerful magic users of a particular type, carefully husbanding their usage of the magic so as to not run themselves dry and working together to make their geniuses as purely colored as possible. I'm thinking a sort of Jedi/Sith split, with a similar organizational structure, but with eight sides rather than just two.

I suspect alliances between magic using orders would be rare, as contact with other magic users would likely weaken your devotion to your chosen facet. Though the positive emotions won't fight each other often, they probably won't work together often unless there is an existential threat.
