Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** How would a world change if a *PERFECT LIE DETECTOR* was invented?

Some rules:

1. The plans of the detector are freely available online, not patented, and it is relatively easy and cheap to make (on the level of about 1000$ in off the shelf parts)
2. The Detector does not "know" what is the *objective* truth/falsehood, only if the person wearing it is telling (what is to them) a falsehood on purpose. Simply, its not a truth oracle, but a Catch-A-Liar detector.
3. The Detector is 99.9999% effective to detect lies in case of YES/NO questions, and 99% effective when discovering lies in open-ended questions. (ie: it can be confused to inconclusiveness if the lie is extremely long and logically convoluted, but only if the liar is also confused by their own lie, or deeply insane).
4. The detector is an electronic crown that plugs into a smartphone-like device. When it detects a brain pattern representing a lie in the making, it emits a loud beep and red light, as well as a pattern diagram of the lie. However, to make a full detection, it is necessary for the person to at least attempt to say the lie.
5. The pattern diagram can be used to derive what part of the lie was the actual falsehood (Example: "I did not kill MY wife" vs "I did not KILL my wife" vs "I did not kill my WIFE".), but the accuracy here is <60%, or even <30% if the person is autistic, has a mental disorder or is a child.

For the sake of the argument, lets say that before anyone stops it or bans it, the plan on how to DIY the Detector is spread all over the known Internet, and countless companies churn out their Detectors. You could buy a cheap but effective one of ebay, or a slightly nicer looking model of the shelf at the local mall.

*** I would expect devices like this to become ubiquitous in every civil and criminal trial. The accuracy in both yes/no mode and with open-ended questions is better than the accuracy of the US justice system, which has an [[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-many-people-are-wrongly-convicted-researchers-do-the-math][estimated false conviction rate of 4.1%]]. With this device, juries would only be needed to decide if the defendant and witnesses are mentally competent enough to understand and remember the truth, and to ensure their questions and answers were phrased so as to leave no ambiguity about the truth.

This would likely also be used in interrogations of captured soldiers, spies, and terrorists. Interrogators could ask open-ended questions like "Tell me everything you don't want me to know", and use torture or "enhanced interrogation techniques" to force responses until the prisoner truthfully can answer 'yes' to "Have you told me everything you didn't want me to know?" There would obviously be a variety of other, similar questions, to ensure the prisoner has provided a thorough and detailed accounting of names, dates, plans, passwords, etc.

These devices may also be used by organized crime, guerilla, or paramilitary forces. People may be kidnapped and forced to give information like their bank account details, bank vault access information, details on government projects (like naming every person assigned to an investigation, and providing their addresses if known), etc. It probably would also be used in loyalty tests - every so often, every member of the organization has to swear that they haven't leaked any information to the authorities, plan to never do so, and don't know of or suspect anyone else of having done so.

This is obviously going to pose an enormous threat, and a substantial amount of effort would probably go into ensuring that people do not know things that would be risky to know. People involved in investigations of organized crime would likely only know each other by pseudonyms, and know nothing of each other's personal lives. The same would likely be true of organized crime, terrorist organizations, spy networks, etc.

In more sophisticated organizations, this might even be combined with a dead man's switch arrangement where each person needs to occasionally go to a personal lie detector combined with a speech-to-text encoder and truthfully state "I haven't been compromised and I remain loyal to [person/organization]". These devices could be rigged with explosives and anti-tampering mechanisms, while failure to return and make the required statement on time could also cause it to detonate. A random number sequence in the device would need to be sent on time to confirm that you're still loyal, so a missed checkup would result in any future meetup plans that involved you being canceled. Thus, if you catch one person, you've only caught one person. The rest of the organization continues functioning.

Lie detection would probably also make its way into politics and news. We would finally have an objective measure of whether or not someone is telling the truth, so it would be feasible for countries to require news organizations to tell the truth, and there would likely be substantial democratic pressure to make that happen. Politicians would probably also end up needing to tell the truth from time to time, e.g. while swearing their oath of office, while testifying, and possibly while debating each other.

Overall, this technology will probably favor dictatorships. It will provide a perfect loyalty test for dictators, and in some cases regime forces might go door-to-door asking people to affirm their loyalty to the dictator. In democracies, it could be used to make sure politicians are telling the truth, but the thorny issue is that it must only be the truth as they perceive it. People who are gullible, biased, and have been heavily propagandized may create an echo chamber of disinformation where no one is lying, but no one is actually telling the truth either.

** Thinking of a setting with fucky gravity, which is expressed mostly by fucky water. Feedback welcome.

This is a high fantasy setting with a lot of magitech. Also decent scientific knowledge imported by isekai'd planars, though the vast majority of it will be inapplicable in the current plane due to something I'm calling technological entropy.

--------------

The center of our existence is an inscrutable hollow sphere known as Keramos, several dozen times the size of mother Gaea, our homeworld from our plane of origin. In this plane there is no sun in the distance, no planets or stars, not space as we know it, empty and dark and and infinite, but instead a grey expanse of non-visible nothing extending into a long finity.

Keramos is made of massive black beams of inviolate black material, woven around each other like a round, black basket. Around it are millions of rocks and glowing comets of all shapes and sizes orbit, as well as all life on this plane; including over a dozen extraplanar originated sophont races in a state of constant war with one another. Over millions of years rock and dirt has calcified around the beams by some kind of intentional process, closing or severely narrowing most gaps between the lattices. The few gaps that remain are known by all as golem spawns and avoided at all costs, as those monstrous facsimiles of life are absolutely inimical to it.

The exception is the two massive apertures at the two poles, which are always either "exhaling" steam from its core or "inhaling" water into it. All life on Keramos pivots around these two processes, which waxes gradually over about 2 months, maintaining peak output for only a few weeks--whereupon over 80% of all affected matter is exchanged--before waning over another 2 months, and then reversing course. Separately, these two processes are know as the "Rise" season and the "Fall" season. Together, they are known as "the cycle", and are considered to make up 1 year.

Little else is known about Keramos, built by unknown creators for an inscrutable purpose. What is known is its strange effect on water and gravity of this cosmology as compared to our home plane, detailed below.

* *I. WATER AND GRAVITY*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: i.-water-and-gravity
  :END:
In any of its states, water outside a living being does not interact with any gravity other than that of Keramos, the hollow sphere.\\
-As a liquid it will always fall towards Keramos.\\
-As a gas it will always rise away from Keramos, unless attracted by the gravity well of a mass of bright ice.\\
-As a solid it will just float aimlessly and not react to any gravity well, not even Keramos, with one exception, that of other masses of solid ice. It also projects its own pseudo-gravity well which strongly affects other masses of solid or gaseous water in a manner almost reminiscent of magnetism. For the purposes of Newtonian physics, ice does retain mass in accordance to its distance from the Keramos gravity well and react accordingly in action and reactoin.\\
-Plasma has never been replicated and so can't be studied, but there are theories that it happens inside the Keramos core...

* *II. WATER AND LIGHT*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ii.-water-and-light
  :END:
Water reacts strangely with light, absorbing it and producing it. Since there is no star, all light on this plane produced by these processes.\\
-Liquid water behaves the most like water from our own plane, and is transparent or opaque in accordance to its composition as one would expect.\\
-Gas is mostly reflective to light, and but only in a diffuse way. The reflected light becomes 'soft' and loses its blue tinge. In sufficient concentrations the vapor itself will appear as a smoke-like grey mass. Note: the color is almost identical to what passes for "space" in this plane. Make of that what you will.\\
-Solid water produces light, glowing in a off white, vaguely blue hue. The brightness varies according to many minor factors in mostly unknown ways, and one major factor, the rise and fall seasons. The brightest peak for ice luminescence coincides with the peak of Rise season, when Keramos is expelling steam. The nadir coincides conversely, when Keramos is attracting ice during the rise season. In effect, Keramos has 2 days a year, where "noon" is never very bright, and night is never fully dark.\\
-Plasma...

* *III. WATER AND THE 4 STATES*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: iii.-water-and-the-4-states
  :END:
Finally, water outside the body will transition its state not according to temperature or any other familiar factor, but as a condition of its mass in relation to Keramos(or more precisely, its gravity well) and, in the case of ice, its own luminescence.\\
-Liquid is either the end or the beginning of the cycle, depending on how one views it. Once water liquefies it is unchangeable to any other state even at absolute zero(0 K) or at 10,000°C, except in the heart of Keramos by some unknown mechanism.\\
-Gas only occurs in the heart of Keramos and will solidify into tiny ice crystals at a set distance away from it. If it is stuck somehow(eg. in a human's lungs) it will condense normally and transition back to liquid state(though never freeze).\\
-Solid water only occurs during the rise season, when vapor rising freely from Keramos is far enough away from its gravity well of origin and solidifies. This distance varies so its particulars are unknown. As ice, it will attract ice of smaller mass and be attracted by ice of greater mass. This reaction is very energetic initially(at low mass) and causes considerable heat from collisions, which is one of the theories as to how ice becomes luminescent(a problem with this theory is that even after it reaches a temperature equilibrium, which varies according to mass but is usually a bit over 0°C, the ice mass will continue to gain brightness). At a diameter of several km(though this too varies unpredictably) the ice reduces several-fold its attraction of smaller massed ice, and it also starts to weakly repel ice above a certain mass threshold, though it will still join together if it collides somehow. Finally, as ice loses its luminescence it will start shedding mass(melting) and start falling in orbit, until it eventually dissolves completely, invariably in the fall season.\\
-As to plasma, over the centuries the episteklos have calculated that more mass leaves Keramos than returns it every year. The famed episteklos Orpheus, acclaimed as an immortal Epistanax while still living(!), has created an intricate model where, within the heart of Keramos, plasma is used to create matter every cycle as if by mytosis, ex nihilo...

*** Can this magical water be cracked into hydrogen and oxygen?

Can plants take in liquid water via the roots and emit gaseous water via transpiration?

I'm not sure yet. On first thought I'm going with no, but I can change my mind. Oh, and this would be within a high fantasy setting but with a lot of magitech. Also a lot of science and physics knowledge from the isekai'd people, though most of it will be inapplicable in this plane.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, living beings can interact with water or vapor in the usual ways as part of the metaphysics, which I won't go into. Suffice it to say that all living things have a quality which allows water within them to act normally.

Your original post suggests that the only way to get gaseous water is by letting it complete the cycle within Keramos. Yet if plant matter and other living creatures can transmute liquid water to gaseous water, any magic or industry which requires gaseous water will be accompanied by large greenhouses to cultivate plants (which emit gaseous water) and capture their emissions for use. Thus, we can exploit transpiration. And to a lesser extent, the moisture emitted in the breath of humans and other animals.

If magical water in any form can be cracked into hydrogen and oxygen, you can burn hydrogen and oxygen together to create gaseous water once more. Perhaps this "burnt" water is nonmagical? Or perhaps you don't have hydrogen and oxygen as elements, and water itself is an elementary form of matter.

****** The idea that water that's been converted naturally inside a living being is made 'nonmagical' is actually a great idea, I'll keep it in mind.

As to the greenhouses idea, I don't think that would be necessary for them to do in this world, as I've pictured it. Vapor would rise in small quantities all the time, its true, but 90% of it would be emitted from keramos in the span of a few weeks in the peak of Rise season. Same with water, some would always be falling, but 90 percent of it would rain within the peak of fall season. Both are very dangerous, as you can imagine; a few weeks of torrential downpour(in the dark), and a few weeks of incredible humidity and little or no visibility.
