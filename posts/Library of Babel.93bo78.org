Spurred by the recent Very Bad Wizards podcast episode, I read Borges' [[https://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf]["Library of Babel." (pdf)]] It's not a Rational story per se, but it is very reminiscent in feel to Chiang's short stories. Come to think of it, Chiang's "Tower of Babel" was probably directly inspired by this. I really enjoyed the hell out of it. It's only five pages long, and I'm curious if anyone else finds it equally enjoyable.


** I also enjoyed it. I was introduced to it in the context of combinatorial problems. It's easy to feel frustrated when one imagines living in such a universe. I wonder how likely it is that, out of all that countless multitude of men trapped in the library, one of them found themselves in a room full of coherent near-misses of comprehensible books. That person might wonder why the library is full of misspellings instead of full of nonsense.

What did you like about it so much?

*** Assuming that there's infinite people to populate the infinite library, the likelihood is 100%. :)

I liked it specifically for its explorations of infinities. The fact that a word could be defined correctly in our language, and that exact same sequence of letters defines the same word correctly in a different language, even those the same word points to two different things *because the words in the definitions mean different things, and correct in context, and just happen to be spelled exactly right in the two language to make this work* was incredibly neat. But then the following "Are you sure you're reading what I meant to write?" was the best follow-up mind-fuck ever. :)

I also really like the fact that this appears to be a book found within the library itself, and may not have been actually penned by anyone at all. It makes sense of references to the world/past we know in a universe with no place for them.

**** *Assuming that there's a very very large, but still finite number of people to populate the very very large, but still finite library.

Borges' short stories are full of interesting shit. I heard that a major component of his idea generating process was looking through old weird philosophy texts and finding ideas that were immensely strange, then taking them to an almost literal extreme.

He does a good job of it, personally extending idealism to a new level where time no longer exists!

** You should also read his "the Garden of Forking Paths" and "the Book of Sand." They're both in here:

**** Yeah, that's an important one as well. Hell, all of it is, really. Immortality and the infinite are running themes throughout most of his work.

**** No problem. I'm pretty sure that pdf has every short story he ever wrote, lots of good stuff in there. It's crazy how many books you can find for free just by googling the title followed by "pdf."

** Checkout [[https://libraryofbabel.info]]

It's a virtual and searchable library that contains every combination of 3200 characters (lower case letters, commas, periods, and spaces) and has 10^{4677} virtual books!

And before you say this site is fake (you're right, it's impossible to store all that data, much less search through it) I can guarantee there's a way to do this without remembering your searches and giving back fake results.

** Sometimes this story makes me sad. There is a sense of longing for TRUTH. As if any truth was more or less random than any other. What this story makes me think of too, that is way more interesting, is the lore that developed around The Button or around the Place. People develop secret societies, there is writing that takes place, arbitrary stands, battles for what feels like a good cause. It feels so real until you step back and look from the outside. Read ee Cummings children's story The Man Who Said Why from his book of Fairy Tales.

*** It depresses me that they are all so obsessed with finding Truth in the books. Even if it was there, they'd never find it. They couldn't trust it to be truth without independent verification, which makes anything they do find worthless. But books are such potent cultural artifacts of Truth that they hijack everyone's truth-seeking into searching for the Right Book rather than doing the hard work of experimentation or creation. :(

** In the Rational!Library fanfiction, the rational librarian uses statistics and compression on books to predict the likelihood of the next symbol based on the previous symbol, taking book location into account. We learn a lot about mathematical formulations of complexity and prediction on the way, with asides about the metaphysical implications.

The protagonist starts will the null hypothesis that it's totally random. It turns out it's not, the compression algorithms actually work, and there's a discernable effect by location. The protagonist eventually becomes able to predict what sort of book will be found where, and constructs a high-dimensional book-space which describes where various books can be found.

In the story, the protagonist would probably at first conclude the books were meaningless and ignores them, having the philosophy that's easier to just write your own books and live your life. It would infuriate the establishment powers when she gets closer than anyone else to actually solving the mystery.

In the end, the axis of the book space don't actually correspond to anything meaningful. At one extreme is simply volumes containing only the letter "A", at another is volumes containing only ".". Discovering the location a meaningful book within this dimensional space requires basically writing the book.

Effectively, thanks to the protagonist and her algorithm, if you really want, you can write a book, and get the location of that book in the library. But that's useless, of course. The people who ignored the books on the shelves were right all along.

** Borges is all very much like that. He wrote a lot about math-inspired concepts like this. Heck, I should re-read some of his stuff, I don't remember well what I read.

BTW since we're talking surreal short stories with a science-inspired topic, may I suggest something else? Italo Calvino's "Cosmicomics" take inspiration from various ideas in astrophysics and turn them into short stories. They tend to be more humorous than Borges - like the one about a bunch of people living very uncomfortably squashed together inside the primordial egg before the Big Bang - but they have a lot of wit and creativity in how they bring abstract or mind-blowing physics concepts down to Earth.

I didn't understand. Beyond the story itself, is this a reference to something?
