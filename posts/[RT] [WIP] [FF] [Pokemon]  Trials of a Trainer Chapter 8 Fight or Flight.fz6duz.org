Summary: There are trainers, and than there are great trainers. This is how I became the very best of them. Join Red and Blue as their rivalry takes them across a very dangerous Kanto in competition for the Grand Championship. Mix of game/anime/manga. Journey!fic Realistic!pokémon Realistic!PokemonBattles

Other Info: Influenced from Lamora's Game of Champions, 50CaliberChaos's The Sun Soul, and Vile Slander's The Saga of Kings, amongst many other fics.

Here's chapter 8. In which Red has to deal with a psychotic scyther. Stay safe!


** I'm just catching up to this now, will say that I'm really enjoying it and it definitely has Game of Champion vibes. I like the relationship between him and his starter.

Was just wondering what your update cadence is?

*** When I first started I had pre-written like five chapters so I was able to post once a week. Now depending on my work schedule I'm just trying to be able to post once a month.
