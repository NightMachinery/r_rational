** I've been watching Akua insinuate herself into the role of Cat's indispensable lieutenant--growing her roots, making herself pleasant and useful, making it harder for Cat to hate her, making it harder for Cat to want her dead. I've been watching that and chewing on my metaphorical lip, worrying about the eventual traitorous consequences. Thinking "Watch out, Cat! You know what she's doing, so don't let her!"

It was while reading this chapter that I realized that Akua has pulled the same trick on /me./ By the time Cat finally defeated her in Liesse, I was utterly sick of Akua's shit and all I wanted was for her to be gone forever. But in her undeath, she just kept being an interesting character and having compelling dialogue and serving a valuable purpose in the narrative. And now, even though I know she's an irredeemable monster, and even though I know that her singular goal right now is to cultivate this exact feeling, I enjoy her screentime and no longer want her to properly die. God damn it.

*** So I will play Akua's advocate here. Cat interrogates her under a truth compulsion (probably almost) every night about her plans. She doesn't have any non-immediate-survival-schemes running that Cat can find and she seems to be thorough. What if Akua is legitimately becoming a better person by virtue of being in winterland detox for villains who can't evil good and want to do other things good too? What if we're seeing the real Akua?

I think we are and that's going to make the decision at the end all the more heartbreaking. Cat doesn't believe in redemption. Akua can never take back the crimes she's committed. But that doesn't mean she will be the same Villain we knew at Second Liesse.

******** The problem is, so much of Praesi traditions are self defeating and ultimately just smoke in the wind. Remember what Cat thought when she fought Akua the last time,

#+begin_quote
  The urge to tell me what that trap in the stairs had been, to expound on her own cleverness. I'd been struck with it a few times as well, that need to tell your opponent exactly how you'd screwed them over, but it was different in her. More intense, and not just because she ran deeper to the source of villainy than I did. It occurred to me, in that moment, how lonely a person Akua must really be. Unable to trust anyone, to do so much as offer a genuine laugh. It was no way to live. The highborn of the Wasteland were inhuman as much because of their history as because they denied themselves the basic trappings of humanity. If all you were was artifice, what was there left?
#+end_quote

I wouldn't be surprised if the whole "Akua and diabolist are two different people" thing fell apart at the mildest prodding by Cat at her soul.

**** Hmmm...

Akua now depends on Cat for survival, and cannot hide her intent. Therefore she has no other venue than actually behaving, and learning actual loyalty and actually aligning her preferences to Cat's. Since she has only worse options she commits herself to it genuinely.

That is why readers start « redeeming » Akua: because that is actually what is happening. Cat is (forced by circumstances into) playing a redemption arc against Akua, and winning. Thus I predict Akua will die to save Cat, and only realise why she's doing it when it's too late or when she's far too committed to it.

Hahahaha no. She might adapt her methods from "betray immediately" to "gain loyalty and become new leader/execute those not happy with that" because she seems to acknowledge that "iron is brittle" or whatever, but she's evil, down to her core. Almost like Black, in a way.

**** Arguments on the usefullness of flying cities underground.

The city has been refered as to be in a giant lake in a ginormous cave, a tall cave.

In universe we have been told that villain fights are a race to the bottom, the side willing to do most clasical/muahaha villainy gets bonus points.

In universe we have been told there are few things more clasically villanous than a good old flying city.

We were told Cat was having trouble with accurate maps and determining when to engage because 200 psycho murderes might pop up anytime. having a bird´s eye view of the battlefield might help with the map problem and flying might give her some measure of defence against the psycho murderers.

A lesser breach would still be a pretty big break in characterization; after all, she's still worried about civilian casualties.

***** Um, Akua needed the Gestalt and lots of preparation and a special place etc to pull off the Greater Breach, yes.

BUT...she has actually pretty good access to the WINTER MANTLE right now, so she has her energy source covered.

She has had practice to use her diabolism training on fae stuff, both at the battle of the camps where she temporarily wielded it, and as assistant ever since.

She also has been the recipient of the "fae influence" that Cat has shunted off, and so - for all her training in principle alienation to lessen the thought-warping properties of fae power - is fundamentally more "aligned" to the WINTER power...in essence, she isn't quite insane fae royalty, but more insane than Cat is.

This translates to more power/efficiency when wielding the Winter Mantle.

Finally, she has the proper sorcerous skill/background to actually wield it - she has often been compared to Masego in her skill with Magic, and this puts her in a very high weight class.

*** I think it is more likely to be a trigger word. I hope it just relaxes some limitations ubua has, but I'm worried it gives her control over cat again.

It would make sense in this situation, cat knows exactly how much better ubua was with her mantle, and spent a chunk of this chapter highlighting she wasn't fighting in the right level. But thief isn't here to fix things if ubua doesn't want to give it back.

Cat did say she hasn't been wasting her time though. Since there is no good way to get better at fighting in a few days, maybe that prep was adding backdoors in her soul to regain control?
