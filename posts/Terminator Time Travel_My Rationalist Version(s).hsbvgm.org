In the /Terminator/ movies, it is made clear several times that "The future is not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves." The movies show many attempts (and a couple of successes) to alter the past, usually to stop John Connor from leading the resistance, or to kill Skynet, depending on what side you're on. However, this explanation of time travel doesn't fit the events of the movies, so I'm going to parse together my own explanation(s). I haven't seen 3-5 in a while, so feel free to correct me on details.

1. In the original 1984 film /The Terminator/ the in-movie explanation of time-travel is that the T-800 was sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor so that John Connor can't win the war against Skynet. This seems perfectly valid at first glance, until Kyle Reese, the time-traveler, is revealed to be the father of John Connor. Since everyone in the movie believes that changing the past changes the future, then the original unaltered version of events would be that Kyle Reese didn't go back in time, but John Connor somehow existed to send him back anyways. In the rational fanfic by Alexander Wales, Branches on the Tree of Time, the explanation is that any child of Sarah Connor is capable of leading the resistance to victory. However, Kyle Reese travels back in time with the foreknowledge that he is John Connor's father BEFORE he had traveled back in time. This would mean that any information they have about the past would likewise be already altered by all time travel that occurred at any point in John and Kyle's then past. In other words, since the terminator was sent to a point in time before they beat Skynet, it is already known that the Terminator fails. This self-consistent timeline makes the most sense, I think, though Kyle Reese still shouldn't be able to know he's the father. It even makes sense for Skynet and the resistance to not have figured this out, Skynet mostly through a lack of information (it probably wasn't able to check police records for evidence of a Terminator in 1984 for the same reason it didn't know Sarah Connor's address.) The resistance had the information for a rationalist to know that their model of time travel was flawed in some way, but could easily not have thought of it. They were guerilla fighters, not scientists. Another example in fiction of a self consistent timeline is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
2. The other 5 movies throw this theory out the window as they all directly change something with the knowledge that it originally went differently, except Terminator Salvation, since time travel doesn't affect the plot. However, none of them (that I remember) gave time travelers information that was dependent on knowledge of their actions in the past. So if you ignore the first movie, you can apply the theory used in /Avengers: Endgame/ and others.

Here's a fun video explaining the different ways that time travel might work. I hope that all made sense.

** There are concepts of time travel where there is an eventually consistent loop that isn't necessarily the first loop.

Maybe Sarah Connor had a child named James, who led the resistance and sent Kyle Reese back, who then fathered a child with Sarah Connor named John, who led the resistance and sent Kyle Reese back, and that second loop is stable.

*** And the new timeline might not require Kyle to go back in time. It already happened, and it might not be a paradox to not send him back in the new timeline. The idea here is that the kyle who went back is from the other timeline that no longer exists.

**** I think that's the idea that /Sarah Connor Chronicles/ was playing with. Every new visitor was from a different version of the future (albeit always one where Judgement Day had happened at some point, and where John Connor had led a resistance against the machines).

** There's a shortage of rational-adjacent time travel movies.

I'd start with /Run Lola Run/ rather than /Terminator/.

***** It briefly read "fics" not "movies" because I pulled a braino, and it looks like GuyWithLag got in while I was editing it. So that's my bad.

I would love to see more rational/rational-adjacent time travel movies.

Like Back to the Future except when Marty gets back his parents have two different kids, because butterflies, and the firstborn was called Marty because Lorraine liked the name.

Also no photograph shenanigans. Doc Brown figures it out from first principles because he's just that cool.

** I remember a similar self-contained loop was present in Season 2 of MLP:FIM (Episode: It's About Time), where POV character Twilight Sparkle is visited by her bedraggled future self (from next Tuesday) and given a distressing warning that is cut off before any actionable details can be given. Twilight then rushes around the country side for days, patching minor crises, accruing injuries and generally becoming more unkempt and anxious about an uncertain future. It finally comes to a head on Tuesday when... nothing happens. She realizes that there's no actual crisis, breaks into the royal archives for a time travel scroll, and travels back in time to tell herself not to worry about it... but gets cut off before she can get into the details, ensuring the loop.

Someone was taken by the idea of how this came to be and wrote the short story "Closed Timelike Curve" [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/189703/closed-timelike-curve]] , which addresses the "first loop" concept nicely.

** What Im confused about the whole series:

*Why is the pre-war reality not absolutely littered with Terminators, and anti-Terminator fighters?* From what we see:

1. every time a Terminator fails, the/some version of Skynet sends a new one, usually more advanced one.

2. Every time there is a risk of SkyNet winning, the Resistance sends a human or a "good" Terminator to prevent it.

3. Number 1 triggers Number 2 and vice versa, in a never ending cycle.

4. We know for a fact that new timeline Terminators run into old timeline Terminators.

5. We know for a fact that past-stranded parts of destroyed Terminators are used speed up the work of Cyberdyne, and improve the future Terminators, as well as Skynet itself?

Therefore, the only logical outcome is that the moment Sarah Connor is endangered by the original Terminator there should be an instant flood of an infinite (or just absurdly large) number of more and more advanced Terminators and Anti-Terminators, resulting in a very crude and messy form of Singularity. The moment the original T800 aims its gun on Sarah for the first time, the War is basically moot, because the recursive nature of Terminatorisms would completely drown the world in time-travellers.

**** I read it not a long time ago, but I do not think it answers this particular question. Terminatorism does increase in it, but only maybe by 1-2 orders of magnitude, not to full capacity.

***** I like the rollover theory where it isn't actual time travel but alternate universes where the change is so infinitely small it looks like time travel. Kyle Reese wasn't the father of the original John Connor because Kyle became an extra-dimensional traveller and knocked up the target of his protection detail and spawned the legend of John Connor Leader of the Resistance, which continued to spill over to more dimensions as that one got to the point of "time travel"
