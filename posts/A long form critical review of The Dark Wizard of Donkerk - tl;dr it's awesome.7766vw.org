I've heard of [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][The Dark Wizard of Donkerk]] a few times, when reading about the NaNo Writing Month. I wasn't really interested, mostly because the name and what I saw made me think the whole thing would be... I don't know, unfinished, or threadbare. After reading it, I would say it's easily alexanderwales' second best finished work.

Also I spent an all-nighter reading it and it's going to haunt me until I write a complete reviews detailing everything I liked / didn't like / noticed, so let's get to it (as an aside, this is probably the lest depressed I've been after spending an all-nighter on a book in a while).

*Spoiler-free review*

The shortest summary of TDWD I could make is "/A World Without End/ except rational and with magic". The story is about Henry, a child raised by two morally ambiguous dark wizards, Rowan, the Prince and heir of the throne of Donkerk, and Sofia, his little sister, who is also a princess. The book follows them (and a few side characters) as they grow up and come of age. Also, there's a prophecy that was made when Sofia was born, but it's not essential to the story.

The whole thing really reads like a Ken Follet book. The characters each have their own perspective and story arc, which sometimes intersect with each other, and grow as the story advances. Henry in particular reminds me of Merthin from /A World Without End/.

Again, this is a coming of age story. There is a prophecy, violence, intrigue, and plots that influence the fate of the entire kingdom, but most of the story is about the characters, their personal philosophy, and how they relate to each other and the world around them. Overall, the whole thing felt very low-key and "Alexander Wales"-ish; this is a story about dark wizards by the guy who wrote a story about Superman where we never see anyone get punched.

If that sounds like your kind of story, go read it right now. */SPOILERS AHEAD/* (and in the comments, presumably).

*The themes*

I said this was a very Alexander Wales-ish story, and I think the themes are part of it. He has written enough stories that I can see a few patterns. The story addresses themes like utilitarianism, dishonesty, inefficiency in government, etc (but not, sadly, what the bloody spirit of Christmas /means/; maybe next time).

Also, it features two men living together raising an adopted child; it's rarely commented upon, and the story never addresses whether the two fathers have a romantic relationship (there's no hint one way or another), which I think is a good thing. I interpreted that as a message saying "Two men can raise a child, it's not special or weird, just move on". I've never seen this take on homosexuality "sometimes people are gay, but that doesn't mean it's the first thing worth mentioning about them" before except in SMBC; I approve, and I hope culture will move in this direction.

I think the theme the story addresses best is utilitarianism, and ethics in general. I think people who think about consequentialism focus too much on the abstract; on specific dilemmas like the trolley problem, and on trying to define an Ultimate Fundamental Philosophy of Right and Wrong. This story does consequentialism right: it shows the consequences. Instead of focusing on abstract dilemmas, it focuses on questions like "What must I do?" and "Which policies should I support?", and shows the results of answering these questions.

It's not too far-fetched to say that dark magic represents consequentialism; Henry is a good consequentialist, Rowan is an evil consequentialist, and the fathers are somewhere in the middle. I don't think they have a different outlook, in the end: they all think about the good they can do, the things they can fix, the people they can help. Henry just happens to be altruistic, where Rowan is selfish; the story talks about how people take the path of least resistance (is that an anachronism, by the way? I think this expression is electricity-related), and Rowan has little resistance to hurting people; because he can get away with it, because nobody raised him to be a good person, and because on a fundamental level he's okay with hurting people.

I think if I wanted to sell utilitarianism to someone, as something to be taken seriously, I might show them this book.

Also, there was the subplot of Ventor and his conflicts with his oath. I'm not sure what point it was trying to make; maybe more commentary on the "path of least resistance" thing, or how people people could rationalize themselves into twisting what is "right" out of habit. I dunno. Either way, it was an interesting side-plot.

*The plot*

Alright, some background. The King of Donkerk is king because, well, his father was, and his father before him, etc. That's how dynasties work. This specific dynasty has a bit of a bonus: the Boreal Crown, an artifact that definitely identifies the heir of the throne.

King Aldric inherited the Crown at a young age, after some crises, and has no family left. As a result, he is very uncertain and dependent on his advisors. It's implied, and sometimes stated, that as a result the Kingdom suffers from quite a few unhealthy power games between the sages, the Dukes, and the chief mentalist. (I love the implication that Aldric was responsible for an imperialist policy of sponsoring foreign wars)

At the beginning of the story, as Sofia is born, he hears a prophecy about her being in danger. Since this is rational fiction, he doesn't do anything ridiculous like lock her up in a dungeon with a dragon forever, but he's understandably worried. The prophecy tells of a Chosen One that would save Sofia, but is extremely vague about who that person would be, or what that saving would consist of (and after reading the whole story, I'm still not sure). He has his sages riddle out the most probable interpretations and sends his Oathkeepers (magic knights) to look for probable candidates, in vain.

After a while, the Queen "dies". We later learn that she was a violent woman, with narcissistic tendencies and poor impulse control; that coupled with her power means her "path of least resistance" was pretty evil. It's implied that the King just didn't have the emotional stability to deal with her or rein her in, and she eventually exiled herself to a (magical) convent to protect her children from herself. Also, she cheated on the King, which he... is in denial about, I think? So while Rowan could plausibly be legitimate, it ultimately turns out he isn't.

When Sofia is 5 yo, she's abducted by the two dark wizards, who need the ransom money to raise Henry. Because dark magic is banned, the kingdom has no protection against it, and they mostly get away with it. This is where the plot really starts, and where things start to go downhill.

*The King*

First off, the King completely freaks out. His daughter was abducted, and there is nothing they could do to retrieve her except cough up the ransom and hope for the best. Her memories have been erased, so she has no idea what happened to her for a week; this means that, from the King's perspective, /anything/ could have happened. Given the prophecy, it's ominous. Of course, /we/ know that what happened was "She was kept in a cottage for a few days".

This leads him to crack down harder on dark magic, but more importantly, this is where Aldric really starts to cut himself off from his children. We don't see enough of him to know what he thinks, but I think it's pretty clear he starts to think of them as liabilities more than family. He starts going around making bastards as back-ups (presumably because he can't stomach the idea of remarrying). He distances himself from his kids, and gets into the habit of denying them almost anything they ask.

He becomes distrustful of Rowan, which unfortunately means that the boy's major influences when growing up are a power-hungry mentalist and the few books on dark magic he can find. He locks Sofia in the castle, which is obviously counter-productive; she becomes socially starved and gets a bad case of cabin fever. Eventually, both of them manage to escape his influence: Sofia through running away, Rowan through memory-stealing and eventually murder. Spoiler alert: one of them is the bad guy.

He's also responsible for some of the shit Dentor pulls, because he's neglectful of his men's oaths when giving orders.

Which leads me to this point: fuck that guy. He's the worst.

I think King Aldric is an interesting character. He's a character you'd rarely find in works other than rational fiction. He's not evil, he's not even selfish or authoritarian or "the end justifies the means" crazy, like other villains in the book. His only sin is to be neglectful, and yet he's easily responsible for almost everything that goes wrong in the second half of the book.

His son becomes distant and resentful, his daughter becomes depressed and desperate, and it's implied the Kingdom suffers politically because of court intrigues, but he's unwilling to even try to fix things; he simply doesn't have the emotional maturity to deal with the problems that pop up outside of his comfort zone. He's petty and arrogant, and he doesn't realize it because he's the King and nobody has ever said "no" to him. Honestly, I couldn't even blame Rowan when he decided to murder him; it had been a long time coming.

I don't know why I hate the King that much. We see Rowan, Ibrahim, Queen Ariel and even Ventor do more despicable things than he does. Compared to them, he clearly didn't deserve to die. I think it's just that... I could have done better. I felt, reading about what he did, that he didn't /have/ to be mediocre and abusive. He could have been better, if he'd even tried. I dunno. It struck a chord is what I'm saying.

*Henry and Sofia*

As the story goes on, Henry starts to move away from his parents, to learn about his origins and become his own person. He's quite successful at both, and proceeds to become the Best Guy Ever. I have a little brother, and I watch him grow up and define himself; reading about Henry meeting people, forming his own opinions and distancing himself from the unsavory side of his parents felt heartwarming in the same way.

Sofia follows a similar process, using her magical power to free herself from her father's influence, meeting spirits, and defining herself as more than the princess. (I was kind of surprised how well the whole "sneak out of the castle and go wander off in the city on my own" thing worked out; I was kind of expecting her to get mugged/shived/Game-ofThrones-ed)

Eventually they meet, Henry decides to follow Sofia around. Sofia pretends to be a mage's daughter, and Henri pretends to believe her. They have a bunch of "I-know-you-know-I-know" games, talk about their backgrounds and beliefs, until Henri confesses to the whole "dark magic" thing, the whole "Chosen one" thing, the whole "My parents abducted you" thing, etc.

They then proceed to consider very very hard the possibility that maybe they should kiss at some point already.

I don't have much to say about Henry and Sofia, except they're great. Like I said, they remind me a lot of Merthin and Caris: childhood crush becomes mutual love between two intellectual young adults with many hopes and ambitions; who slowly overcome the differences separating them, and take over the world together (also the evil brother dies at the end). I feel their romance is maturely handled, although it felt maybe a little "too easy".

All their conversations about everything are great. They didn't feel awkward or stilted, and they didn't feel /too much/ like an author mouthpiece. On the other hand, Henry is active and decisive, while Sofia is more reactive and passive; which makes sense given their respective backstories, but maybe it weakened the philosophical parts. Like maybe those would have been better if Sofia argued more "aggressively", if she was more of Henry's equal and less of his student.

*Good and Evil*

One thing I liked about /Shadows of the Limelight/ (and /Glimwarden/, and in a sense, /Metropolitain Man/) was that it was clearly, blatantly never about good and evil. I think the big message I got from reading /Shadows/ was that ultimately, power is not in the hands of good people or evil people, it's in the hands of the government. Everything flows from that.

TDWD explores that theme. Henry and Sofia specifically talk about this, quite a bit; while there are specific evil people as antagonists (Ibrahim and Rowan), they're almost secondary. We often see people get hurt, not from other people being good or evil, but from institutions being inefficient and prejudiced. Ventor kills a witch who, as far as we know, did nothing but heal people, because the law says she wasn't allowed to. Presumably there are parallels here with real legislative problems, like the war on drugs, pornography bans, and the war on terror.

In a way, I feel like this is one of the most uplifting message I've got from rational fiction.

*The weak parts*

I don't have much to say here. Some negative points:

- The book is only 173.000 words long, which means I'll need to find something else to read for the other 363 days of the year.

- I don't like the title. "The Dark Wizard of Donkerk" obviously refers to Henry, who doesn't actually perform dark magic until at least halfway through the book. And even by the end, he's never really defined by dark magic like his fathers were. He's an intellectual, a "sage of sages", more than a Dark Wizard.

- Like I said, I didn't really expect much from the story before reading it. Maybe it was the nondescript title, maybe it was knowing it was written during NaNo month so it might be rough and badly paced (I don't think it's the case now), maybe it just wasn't advertised enough. I feel like there should be a disclaimer somewhere that says "No, seriously, read it! It's as good as Glimwarden!"

- I feel like maybe the philosophy parts would have benefited from being a tiiiiiny bit less one-sided towards utilitarianism. I feel like Sofia accepted dark magic too fast, and overall didn't really argue her side as well as she could have. She could have made a point on the harm Henry's fathers indirectly caused when they abducted her, or the Oathkeepers Adrianna killed.

- Non-minor concern: I wish the part where Sofia meets Rowan again were longer. There's a lot they could have caught up on before they started exchanging threats. I thought they were going to exchange perspectives on their father, their childhoods, how they turned out, dark magic, their mother, etc. I though there was a legitimate chance Sofia could have convinced Rowan that he wasn't fit for the throne, and tried to repair their relationship. Henry could have called Rowan out on the innocents he hurt by stealing memories. In the end, the way Sofia addressed Rowan wasn't so different from the way her father did, and it's never really pointed out.

- Similarly, the epilogue was maybe a little short. It addressed the pay-off to the emotional side of the story (Sofia and Henry's relationship, the King's legacy, etc), and somewhat addressed the political side of things, and how the characters would move forward. But I think all these points could have been addressed better, in more details.

- The format is awful. As a general rule, if a have to use [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages][Firefox Reader View]] to be able to read a page, it means the page's layout needs to be changed. (also, the thing would be easier to browse with more chapters)

Wow, on second thought I /did/ have much to say. I kinda want to emphasize most of these complaints are really minor.

--------------

*Conclusion*

That's my review of The Dark Wizard of Donkerk. It's a really great book, and a great example of rational fiction. It hits on its main themes well enough that I feel I could recommend it to someone who wished to learn about utilitarianism. It was pleasant to read, and had no major weak points. I give it banana out of coconut points. I'd honestly be willing to buy it, or other books by the same author. Like, for real money and stuff.

Alright, now that I'm reasonably sure I've lured alexanderwales here, and I've buttered him up enough, here's the real reasons I wrote this post.

What's the status of Glimwarden? Is it in permanent hiatus? Semi-permanent hiatus? Are you actively working on it, or do you have not enough free time? When do you expect updates to resume? Would proof-reading help? Did you think my review was spot on? Would you like to give out author commentary? (Also, how's life as a dad?) /Glimwardeeeeeeeeen/.


** I think being a dad suits me well. It's been about twenty months since I quit my job as a software engineer to be a stay-at-home dad, and for the most part that's been great. We have less money now (more because we're now on my wife's income alone rather than the kid), but I have a lot less stress, and watching after my son is something that I actually take pleasure from. We go visit the many parks our city has on offer, take hikes through the woods with him on my shoulders, read books together, and in general I get a lot of enjoyment from watching him grow and develop, both in a fatherly pride way and because of my interest in neurological development.

--------------

As for Glimwarden ...

I got way too invested in the 2016 US presidential election. I ended up devoting a lot of time and energy to telling people on the internet that they were wrong, which isn't terribly out of character for me, but I did it with a lot more intensity and anger than I normally do, in part because it seemed like 95% of the people who were nominally on my "side" were more interested in seeing how hard they could smugly signal their (supposed) virtue and tribal affiliation than they were in either talking intelligently about the issues, engaging with opposing viewpoints, or actually winning the election. As the election progressed, I was devoting more and more time and mental energy to that, rather than writing.

Eventually I realized that I was just making myself angry and unhappy, and started the process of carving real-world politics out of my life, dropping all existing relationships to the people I normally talked politics with, blacklisting news sites, enabling a bunch of filters, etc., which has generally made me happier.

I've had three problems with writing Glimwarden again:

1. The story is grim in a lot of ways that I don't want to feel grim, and talks about or features politics in a lot of ways that just leave a sour taste in my mouth. This was especially the case for some planned plotlines that couldn't/can't be easily reworked. I guess I want more optimism than was planned for Book I of Glimwarden.
2. I sort of consider myself unsuited to serial fiction, in some ways. If you really want to /succeed/, then I think you need to have a consistent update schedule and be willing to pump out thousands of words per day, you have to be willing to accept a lot of imperfection, /and/ you need to stick with one story for a long time, partly because the key to success is just slowly grinding out the building of an audience. Glimwarden was planned to be that -- and still is, in a lot of ways -- but the longer I've been writing, the more I might not have that in me.
3. I have a problem with monogamy. I see an attractive story idea walk by in a short skirt, and especially when I don't have a set update schedule to stick to or promises that I've implicitly or explicitly made that people will hold me to ... it's like that new story idea will just worm its way into my brain, and I'll start first thinking about what kind of characters I would want, then what the structure would be like, and then I start jotting down some notes, and finally I'll just write a scene or two, and then before I know it I've "wasted" a month where I was working on this new thing rather than putting in time with Glimwarden.

My intent was to write in private so I could make chapters that all worked together and didn't introduce flaws that couldn't be fixed, but that hasn't worked out so well. More and more, I think that to be a proper serial author, you have to just fail at your story sometimes and hope that the good is good enough to make up for the bad, and that sort of grates at me, because I want to be a more polished, professional author than that.

I'm not writing Glimwarden right now, I'm writing this other thing that's captured my attention, and my plan is to keep going on that while I have the momentum. Once I either (hopefully) finish that, which will be a few months, or flame out and die, I'll go back to Glimwarden and probably start publishing what I have and just return to a weekly update schedule rather than my original plan of writing in private until Book I is complete and then going from there.

*tl;dr: Glimwarden is on indefinite hiatus, but not permanent hiatus.*

--------------

You know, I went searching for my own post-mortem of /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ and apparently I never wrote one. I would do that now, but I'd have to sacrifice writing time for it, especially since I would have to reread the thing, and in rereading would probably want to fix some things.

I don't know if you've read them, but posts [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html][1]], [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html][2]], and [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html][3]] on pre-writing it (from 2014) might be illuminating. I'd be happy to answer whatever (non-interpretation) questions you have, to the extent that I actually remember what I was thinking. There are large swaths of it, especially in the back half, that I wrote but never read, and writing for me is more ephemeral than reading.

#+end_quote

Wow. Yeah, those are interesting. In a sense, they confirm my reading on some of the story's parts. I've read the story, analyzed it, thought "Okay, this character represents X, this character represents Y", and it's funny to see it confirmed or denied in the notes.

There are differences between the notes and what you ended up writing, mostly in term of pacing. The story as planned in the notes would have had a way shorter arc 1, and moved on to Henry and Sofia on the run. It would have focused on their adventures, and maybe have them fight monsters and stuff?

The story as published spends more time on Rowan, and has him as a protagonist before he becomes a villain. We see all three of them develop, how Henry and Sofia become socially starved (which probably helps their teenage romance), and Rowan's start of darkness. Honestly, I like it that way. The stakes are emotional more than physical, which is something I'd rarely seen before; it felt more grounded and realistic than "and they had various adventures and fought monsters" would have.

The notes said Rowan was intended as a mirror for Henry, which I think came across well. Henry as written in the notes strikes me as a first draft for Sander Seaborn. In the finished version, Henry feels more competent, wiser and generally more on the ball than Sander.

Also, the notes says the story was going be about a dark/evil dichotomy. I like that it went into a more nuanced commentary on utilitarianism instead. The "dark != evil" thing strikes me as haggling on labels, and I've had enough of that with Star Wars fics already.

I'm surprised that the magic system stayed exactly the same. Also, it was pretty interesting to see a system that I'd discovered through world-building and exposition be laid out as pure authorial text.

#+begin_quote
  especially since I would have to reread the thing, and in rereading would probably want to fix some things.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's a slippery slope. I you find time to do it anyway, I'd recommend focusing on a specific part: the sequence between "Sofia inherits the magic crown" and "Sofia and Henry retreat, and meet Henry's parents". Here's how I see it:

The story mostly revolves around Sofia and Henry's growth as characters. At the end of the second arc, Sofia learns a ton of information, about her mother, Henry, her brother, the prophecy, the abduction, etc. She should be given the time to process that information before she confronts Rowan.

I feel like Sofia and Henry confronting Rowan should be the climax of the story, where everyone proclaims their beliefs and draws lines in the sand. There should a scene where Sofia begs Rowan to renounce his mad ambitions, and Rowan lets out his insecurity about her being the favorite, etc. The actual battle should be an afterthought, like the battle between Lex Luthor and Superman in TMM.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Sure, here's one: when Rowan is confronted by Amelia (the first servant girl he stole memories from), he has no memory of the incident, which is weird, because it was pretty memorable, and a mentalist isn't supposed to forget things anyway.

This is never explained, but my assumptions was that he'd sacrificed the memory in a ritual; which implies that he's done a fair bit of self-modification, and liberally sacrificed parts of himself he really should have held on to; which in turn explains why from that point on his sanity seems to be in free fall.

Is that what happened?

#+end_quote

That's a shame.

For the record, I thought Glimwarden was much more optimistic than your other stories. It feels like reverse Attack on Titan: humanity is progressing, building infrastructure and weapons (minigun!), and the protagonists are mostly trying to make things better. It's the little things, like when Philip mentions they've developed a new type of lantern in the past decade, and now that it's field tested they might deploy it.

And I don't want to tell you what to write, but I'd just like to say that I loved the political analysis in Glimwarden, and I hoped to see more of it.

As a French person (normally) living in Paris, I was particularly interested in how the refugee crisis arc would evolve. It's a theme that hits close to home, to stuff I see happening where I live, and that I don't really know how to parse or how I should feel about. Some of the stuff you wrote felt like it helped me understand the political situation of my country.

I hope you don't drop it completely.

**** I think I have a tendency to rush confrontations, because when I get to a scene where two people who are at each other's throats finally have each other in their sights, it seems like they would just go for it, rather than talk first. But this is one of those things where I might need to suspend my own disbelief a little bit, in the interests of paying off tension and narrative better. (This is, I feel, the primary problem with /The Last Christmas/, and the part that I keep meaning to rewrite every time Christmas rolls around.)

That's the intended reading. I think I was going for having it be /more/ terrifying because of both the reader having to figure it out on their own, and the dramatic irony of the reader knowing something that Rowan doesn't.

It's mostly that every time I came to this subreddit I was made to feel bad about not working on Glimwarden, and since writing is my primary release from the stress of parenting (and everything else), I wanted to change it up so I didn't feel bad about writing the thing I was enjoying writing. My flair on [[/r/HPMOR]] has been "Keeper of Atlantean Secrets", which one of the mods there gave me, and I've always liked that title. I might add an adjective in, I don't know.

Oh yeah, I definitely see how Sofia would be at Rowan's throat immediately.

On the other hand, it doesn't mean they have to jump to physical violence. Henri could act as a mediator of sorts, be a voice of reason.

Or Rowan could arrange a private audience, dismiss his guards, and make a point like "Dad isn't there anymore, we don't have to have guards watching our every breath" before they start to throw accusations.

At that point, I'd also expect Rowan to have some deep insecurity, and want some sort of emotional validation from his sister: if she recognizes how bad she suffered from her father, it absolves him of the guilt of killing him, and if she recognizes the usefulness of dark magic, it validates him as a wise ruler.

#+begin_quote

Yeah, that was kind of ominous. It would have been more ominous if he'd gone full SCP, with increasingly more references to decisions he's forgotten, and the implication that he did /something/ he didn't fully understand. Maybe in the climax Sofia could have told him "remember when we did X?" only for him to go "what are you talking about?".

Although, while I'm on the subject, I liked the whole "King Scar on Pride Rock" theme the story struck at the end. Rowan has built his power on a foundation of lies and shortsighted decisions, and you get the sense that his rule will be extremely unstable no matter what happens. Legalizing dark magic to get more dark magic books in particular seemed like a nice "jump off the sanity cliff" move.

Sort of. Right now The Last Christmas is basically 2/3 of a story.

But I don't think detailing out the fight between nice!Santa and evil!Santa would be any better. My main problem with the story was that the transition between "the elves do whatever Santa wants" to "the elves dump Santa" was way too abrupt. It probably needed one or two more chapters.

It sounds more like you're the authorial equivalent of a serial start-up founder. You want to do the fun parts (getting the thing off the ground) and then leave someone else to the drudgery of actually piloting it where it needs to go.

Which is to say: ever thought of working with a ghostwriter---the kind that turns chapter outlines + a world bible into finished books? You could be the next [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Drake#Works][David Drake]]:

#+begin_quote
  In addition to his solo works, Drake has co-authored novels with authors such as Karl Edward Wagner, S.M. Stirling, and Eric Flint. Typically Drake provides plot outlines (5,000--15,000 words) and the co-author does "the real work of developing the outline into a novel". He does not "consider [his] involvement to be that of a real co-author."

** First off, I found DWoD a fantastic read; certainly one of the best rational fiction stories that I've come across.

Some minor criticisms I had (some of these were from a comment I made in an embedded thread a while back; reposting here where it's more relevant):

*WARNING: SPOILERS AHOY*

- I agree with OP's points on the title

- It would have helped to plant the seeds for Henry's unique personality earlier on. Besides a few scenes with his fathers (such as the discussion about going to work for the Sisters), we don't really get much insight into his character until the last third of the book. Maybe more conversations early on between himself and Nathan would help (which might also help illustrate why Henry's so drawn to the princess's intellect, if her answers and logic are more quick witted than the small-town friend he normally talks with)?

- The magic system was excellent; I liked the trifecta of dark-oath-mind magic, and how they (or at least, dark and oath) were just facets of the much deeper and more ancient spirit magic. However, there were a couple mentions to other types of magic (elementalists? eloists? denialists?) that I thought should be removed. From a worldbuilding perspective, including so many systems breaks Sanderson's Laws of Magic (not that these are hard and fast rules, but I think he has some good reasoning behind them), and from a logical perspective, if these magics are worth talking about, why are they never explored, or seen practiced by anyone in the entire kingdom?

- My biggest complaint was with the “savior” section of the prophecy, which never really made sense to me. As far as saving the princess, Harry probably contributed the least there - his father and Sister Marigold help way more than he does in the mentalist realms, and his other father and the princess's spirits do the heavy lifting in the physical realm. Plus, the princess ultimately ends up saving herself from the villain by her own power! What little fighting Harry does, heavily relies on Ulf-armor and Ventor's sword, not his own strength (plus, he's never shown to be much of a fighter anyway). Or, if “savior” refers to saving the kingdom, we'll never know, as the epilogue ends far too early for us to see if he'll actually have any positive impact.

- An interesting twist, I think, would be if the prophecy were rewritten in such a way that it could be interpreted for the /princess/ to actually be the savior. It's a cool multi-layered twist: she's her own “savior” (in that she saves herself from being killed by her brother), she's the kingdom's savior (in that she saves it from being ruled by a madman, and hopefully improves things with her logical mind and advice from the sages of sages), AND it inverts both classic hero-saving-princess tropes and protagonist-as-the-chosen-one tropes. Everyone expects Henry to be the savior - and its those expectations that pull him into the story in the first place - but he ultimately ends up a red herring, at least as far as the prophecy's concerned.

But again, all minor complaints. This is still my favorite Wales work, and I loved Metropolitan Man.

- The Last Christmas (original)

- Two HP:MoR crackfics

- A Bluer Shade of White (Disney's Frozen)

- The Metropolitain Man (Superman)

- Shadows of the Limelight (original)

- The Dark Wizard of Donkerk (original)

- Instruments of Destruction (Star Wars oneshot)

- Glimwarden (original)

- A few other stories you can find on his blog (the Randi prize, the one with the teleportation accident, etc).

My favorite is The Metropolitain Man. That one is basically the fic you use as an example when you need to explain "what is rational fiction" to someone.

Otherwise, I'm not a fan of the Frozen fic and the MoR fics; I like The Last Christmas and the Terminator fic, but they're kind of... gimmicky? As in, I don't really feel like they have a deeper message, something meaningful to say. All the other fics I cited are great, and I recommend them. Glimwarden is in hiatus, the others are complete.

** I finally got around to reading this over the weekend, after [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5w9prq/the_dark_wizard_of_donkerk_alexander_wales_rthfc/de95qx2/][implying I would]] some 7 months ago. Incidentally, I didn't see any overt connection to The Dark Lord of Derkholm, at least not beyond the superficial, e.g. the general fantasy setting. Actually, I saw more of a resemblance to Gaiman's Stardust, which was also a vaguely episodic Bildungsroman with romance brewing between its two teenage protagonists. So there's some relation there at least (Gaiman and Jones were good friends, and I've always felt Stardust to be the most Jonesian of Gaiman's books).

Some scattered thoughts, comments, and criticisms, in no particular order:

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of Stardust -- and my memories here are plenty distorted, having read it last a decade ago in my teens -- I felt it to be a much more colorful and eventful story than Donkerk, whose main events can be summarized in a shorter handful of lines. But that's understandable, given how much longer Stardust was... except wait, Donkerk has 3.5x as many words. Puzzled at this (and with the above caveat), I think it's because Stardust doesn't aspire as deliberately towards internal consistency -- things happen on a much more ad hoc basis, which hints at a much deeper world underneath. However, given that Wales' imagination pales before the richness of the real world (no offense!), this greater internal consistency to me served partly to pull back the curtain and expose the shallowness of everything outside the main plot. While the focal characters seemed dynamic enough, the background seemed fairly generic, with hints of the broader world (e.g. guns, scheming royal sages, Nathan, etc.) falling a bit flat. It's sort of like if Stardust gives you a dozen puzzle pieces, and they're all different colors showing parts of different scenes, only you have but a vague inkling of how they fit together; Donkerk, meanwhile, gives you 50 pieces, and while there's plenty of variety you can tell roughly where they all go. But perhaps the comparison is unfair to make (given Gaiman's greater fame and different target audience).
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  That said, I think I'd have still welcomed greater exploration of the nature of different superpower sources. Of the main ones (disregarding eloism, elementalism, and denialism, whatever those actually entail) it was ultimately revealed that oathkeeping, dark magic, spirit calling, and magic item use come from agreements made with the spirits -- but they're different spirits in each case? The oathkeeping spirits seem to care about personal sacrifice (it was suggested that greater temptation and resistance led to greater powers, but maybe that's not the case), but the dark magic spirits dgaf, since you can sacrifice others(‘ memories, lives, etc.) non-consensually. Personally, I'd have preferred dark magic to work in proportion to the caster's personal sacrifice and in relation to their personal effects (else why bother saving Henry's baby teeth? and not just acquire some elsewhere? convenience, I guess), though that's a bit more munchkinable given mentalist self-modification.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  And so, it was hard not to come up with possible experiments exploring easy paths to OPness by exploiting more the disparities in spirit values and typical human values. If spirits care enough about strands of hair to lend humans their power, could you find one that also cares about my promise to, say, never eat precisely than 1000.01kg of bread in a single day? If there's some minimum boon value then it should be trivial to take a hundred thousand oaths and reap their additive benefits. Additionally, can mentalism be used for recursive self-improvement? Can I sacrifice trivial memories? Can I make an oath to fast only during daylight hours, and how does it compare to an oath of never eating ever? (Ventor's oaths in particular seemed exceptionally ill thought-out, as were others' given implied attrition rates. Since they're trusted to not break their oaths anyway, why not trust them “act in the best interests of Sophia, but also weigh kingly request strongly” or something. Given the rigid wording of some of these commands/oaths it seems you'd quickly run into no-win scenarios).
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Prophecy likewise was pretty underexplored -- it motivates so much of the plot, but we just hear that it “had come crashing down”. So why do people trust it? Where does it come from? Does it happen often? Does it usually play out in the expected manner, or usually subvert expectation? Everybody seems to take it seriously enough, but my first guess would have been some bloke has happened upon a voice-projecting magic artefact and is playing silly buggers. And whatever prophetic spirit delivered it seems to care about an ababcdcd rhyming, but not so much metre (it's a bit clunky on my tongue read aloud, but that could well just be me)? Where the other magics felt integrated into the broader world, prophecy seemed more a plot device -- but not even deconstructed in an especially clever manner (I'm fond of the “satisfy the letter of the prophecy on your terms” trope -- so if your son is fated to kill you, do your best to love him deeply, raise him well, and invest strongly in competitive virtual reality video games).
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  Also, when Henry and Sofia were fleeing Ventor, they changed their names well enough -- but not so much their appearances or demeanors? Passed through town alone at times? Feel they could have laid a more muddled trail that way.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  There were a good number of typos scattered throughout, but that's understandable given Donkerk's lack of beta readers/editor. Most of them involved the wrong name being used (e.g. the first line in the epilogue reads “Hirrush sat down on the bed beside Hirrush”, which, while possible in the mental realm, would imply a layering not yet introduced ;]). Sometimes words are doubled doubled (which is easy enough to correct). Other times I felt word choice a bit dodgy (e.g. reticent/reticence is used 2x as often as reluctant/reluctance, despite the latter being imo much [[http://grammarist.com/usage/reluctant-vs-reticent/][more appropriate]]). Overall though I found the writing to be technically quite good.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  I'm very partial to the “sometimes people are gay, but that doesn't mean it's the first thing worth mentioning about them” point regarding ambiguity in the Omarr and Hirrush relationship, and insofar as they are gay am certainly happy that they're not stereotypical flamboyant gay men, whose entire identities are wrapped around their love for loud clothing and cock. /However/, I think an uncharitable reader could draw from their depiction the message that it's ok to be gay so long as you never do anything to remotely indicate anything “icky” (assuming they weren't just meant to be aromantic/asexual life partners not fond of physical touch). I remember this criticism being levied against Dumbledore back when, but where his role in that story is “wise old wizard-mentor”, the nurturing relationship between Omarr and Hirrush is a fairly central focus of this one. And while plenty of intimacy, care, and commitment is implied, I don't recall ever reading about a single act of physical intimacy between them (even something as chaste as handholding). Maybe I just missed it. Regardless, while their lives shouldn't revolve around their gayness for each other, if they're at all neurotypical I'd still expect them to show a bit more affection, at least in the privacy of home.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  The last half of the story felt a bit rushed, compared to the slow burn of the first half. Which is odd, since the former takes place over orders of magnitude less time than the latter. Maybe I was just more aware of the time-skips since they were more connected -- where initially it flows from standalone scene to standalone scene, wrapping each one up before moving on, later it goes between connected parts of the same substory, e.g. Sofia resolving to rally the troops, and then immediately afterwards assaulting the castle (having already gathered various spirit allies). I would have liked to see that gathering!
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  I liked the characters overall, and was especially pleased when e.g. the chekhov's badass grandmas were fired (Marigold and Constance). Henry and Sofia were both quite pleasant, and their repartee enjoyable, and I wish there were a bit more of it (e.g. re: the ethics of non-human animal slaughter for meat consumption, though I'm a bit biased there, as my generic exclusion might imply ;] it's also hard not to imagine the arguments I could give for various positions they discussed and read theirs dissatisfied). I think Henry could have done with more explicit flaws (e.g. instead of being “impossibly charming”, give him poor social skills, make him stumble over his words; instead of giving him so many practical talents, from “expert foraging” to “incapacitating most full grown men with [his] bare hands”, make him bookish but only to the extent that his meager resources would allow; instead of him denying his fathers' pseudoimpartiality, have his cold, robotic heart by melted by Sofia's competent compassion). His development would have had a bit more room to work with, then. I guess it's realistic that he be so Gary-Stu-ish, given eidetic memory, supernatural emotional control, etc. So I guess it would be good to do away with some of those aspects altogether (plus, if “for a mentalist it was nothing to simply keep a copy of sensitive material in the mind instead of on paper” I'd expect society to be rather dramatically different, even if most people have hard limits w.r.t. the flashiest mentalist powers. Perfect memory would I imagine drastically accelerate rates of technological progress, say, and be one of the first things to learn if not tabooed).

  Would Rowan become a good guy were it not for his father's negligence and emotionally abusive parenting style (repressed anger at Ariel's infidelity?), coupled with Ibrahim's less-than-upstanding influence? Was he just starved for some morsel of human decency and attention the whole time? It's mentioned that he “cut off a bird's wing just to see what would happen”, but color me unsympathetic, since animals are killed violently throughout this entire book, including by e.g. Henry, and the pleasure of satisfied curiosity seems if anything more wholesome a motivation than the pleasure of meat. Obviously Rowan disrespects human autonomy often enough later on, but if e.g. Aldric were less an asshole would have grown differently?
