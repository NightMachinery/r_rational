Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** This is a basic plan for a story I'm starting.

In a society analogous to Renaissance Europe (probably on the older end of it, so think early 1400s), the world appears much the same as our own but for a few differences:

1. Blood doesn't spill. When exposed to the atmosphere for more than a few seconds, blood (apparently) evaporates. This doesn't interfere with coagulation.
2. A small percentage of people who have been in life or death situations (specifically those involving near death by exsanguination) are capable of performing magic. This magic is powered by blood.
3. A blood mage who is extremely low on blood (especially when first unlocking their potential) will experience an unstoppable desire to draw blood through the skin of a nearby human by magic. Some of this stolen blood is used to heal themselves, and some to restore their levels of blood to normal.

   1. If there are no humans around, they will usually just die (it would be possible to force the unlocking event artificially and still save the subject, but nobody wants to try this).
   2. If there are humans around, they will almost certainly attempt to drain the most accessible of their blood in order to prevent death. They won't be able to control the quantity taken, instead drawing it until they are either fully healed or their victim(s) have run dry.
   3. The magic to siphon blood works only on humans for reasons that are, in-universe, attributed to the evil and predatory nature of blood mages. If the only nearby candidates are animals, they will not instinctively attempt to drain them.
   4. Nobody in the setting has discovered blood types yet. This means that in many cases blood mages will end up killing themselves by absorbing incompatible blood. I haven't yet worked out the exact odds (it depends on the distribution of blood types, which can be tweaked a little since it varies by population), but it would be often enough that blood mages would develop a reputation for it (how much of a reputation depends also on how long it takes to die from this transfusion).
   5. Naturally, not much study has been done on blood mages. They are seen as vampire-analogues or possessing spirits. Those that survive their initial ordeal and don't kill themselves attempting magic and using up all their blood (either through ignorance or desperation) generally have no desire to use their abilities at all.

4. Blood mages can also voluntarily donate blood (to a person, container, or just the atmosphere) and can extract it from all of the above (though they'd have to be very quick for the latter, since it would be evaporating rapidly). In both cases it must pass through the caster's body.
5. Magic is potentially extremely powerful, but the fact that you have to use your own blood to perform it makes it much more limited. You can't perform magic on unassimilated blood, so you pretty much have to either know about blood types (not practical in the setting, at least before the events of the plot) or stick to extracting your own blood and waiting for it to refill.
6. I haven't yet decided on the exact powers, but they'd be able to heal and harm at close range.

So, given all the potential negative associations with blood magic and the comparative rarity of its practitioners (fewer than 5% have the potential, let alone develop it), is it reasonable for society to still be close to 1400s Europe?

The bigger divergence might be the fact that blood does not spill, which changes the infectivity of bloodborne diseases (still transmissible by sex, not so much from fighting or bleeding) and changes how women are affected by menstruation.

I can elaborate on what drives the above setting differences (which is almost certainly a much bigger change to the world from our own), but it'll have to wait for me to get some sleep.

*** Some points:

- Blood type incompatibility could possibly lead to a split classification of the mages, between "dark" ones (AB+, can receive transfusions from anyone, and giving transfusions to almost anyone else harms them) and "light" ones (O-, can't receive transfusions from most people, but can heal anyone), with all of the other blood types being a mix.

- Transfusing the wrong blood type results in a "sense of impending doom", even at concentrations that make you sick instead of killing you. This has interesting implications for the mythology of your world, as well as possibly acting as very expensive and difficult form of blood typing.

- When blood evaporates, does it leave its pathogens behind? If so, blood borne diseases would still happen some, just not as often.

**** I really like that light/dark split idea. Once blood mages form a fledgling community (i.e. after they discover blood types several hundred years early) it will probably split partially along those lines.

For reference, the protagonist is going to be AB+ (between 2% and 10% of the population in the real world, depending on the country), with his father being A+ and his mother B+.

O- has a similar distribution, except some Asian countries (China, Japan, India, Korea, the Philippines, probably others that just haven't measured it) have a very low rate of all Rh- blood types.

Assuming an incidence of about 5% for each, we'd expect to see far more dark mages initially, since all the O- mages will generally die after they unlock their potential (only surviving if the person they drain is O-, which is a 5% chance unless they're a close relative).

Later, once they come up with a system to trigger the event without needing to drain another person (probably just transfusing their blood out and straight back in), this skewed ratio would be corrected. By then the dark mages would have probably set the agenda for the community, so there would be some consequences to changing the balance.

The sense of impending doom is very interesting, along with some of the other symptoms I just looked up. It would appear a lot like being smited for an evil act, with purpura (rash of purple spots on the skin), jaundice (yellowed skin), and dark brown urine.

I'm not sure how long it would take for a near-total blood transfusion to be fatal, which is a pretty key detail. Any ideas where I could find that information?

When blood evaporates, anything in solution with it will vanish too. It's not truly evaporation, it's more like the blood is being taken. The people of the setting draw the connection to evaporation from the way it appears to turn into a mist and quickly dissipate, but strictly speaking there's no way to stop it (i.e. neither higher pressure nor lower temperature would keep it a liquid; even solid blood would "evaporate", though they haven't reached the level of scientific knowledge required to know that makes little sense).

*** Menstruation isn't blood as such. It's very blood-like, but it's different - it's the broken down uterine lining and stuff too. Thicker and more coagulated. So I'm not sure how much that would be affected by something that affects blood coming from veins.

#+begin_quote
  Menstrual fluid contains some blood, as well as cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood. ... About half of menstrual fluid is blood. (wikipedia)
#+end_quote

I guess along with this you gotta think about what happens if someone has internal bleeding and coughs / vomits / poops blood, because "blood mixed with other fluids in contact with air" may not have the same magic as "pure blood in contact with air"

**** The way I'm currently modelling it, a solution of blood will evaporate along with the solute, while a mixture of blood will evaporate separately (possibly slower, since less surface area will be exposed).

As far as I can tell, menstrual fluid is a mixture, so it would only be the blood that evaporates. That would probably make it less red in colour and more viscous. It may be enough to change the associations with menstruation (e.g. currently people talk about women bleeding, but they might not realise blood was ever a component of this fluid), but it probably wouldn't affect the realities of dealing with it in a pre-feminine-hygiene-product society.

** Continuing from last week as usual on the worldbuilding of a [[https://www.gitbook.com/book/kiba/ninja_scout/details][kung fu battle wizard setting]]. I should probably get someone to proofread the work.

Also, I am told that the magic system I am using is not original enough and too close to Naruto's magic system. Let me know how I can make the magic system more distinct.

Do note that it's crucial that ninja must be able to navigate a three-dimensional world and carry out logistics for their civilization. Right now, ninja use pocket dimension storage and adhere to walls and trees like spiderman.

I thought that you were specifically riffing off of Naruto, so consider me another data point on that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

First off, drop the term "chakra." Between that and "chakra beasts," the comparisons to Naruto will be many.

You specify "kung fu," though, so let's see what we can do by focusing on Chinese mythology.

Interestingly, the term /Wulin/ means "Warrior's Forests," which brings to mind previously-discussed images of your three-dimensional world.

Reading up on the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (or "Boxers" as they are more commonly known), a recent but defunct Chinese sect whose beliefs may fit what you're going for, we find them practicing "martial arts and calisthenics" and seeking "a type of spiritual possession which involved the whirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to deities."

Furthermore, they "believed that through training, diet, martial arts and prayer they could perform extraordinary feats."

Let's take the possession and set the exact nature of it aside. Whether it's spirits with personality, amnesiac ghosts who really do nothing at all but fuel your powers, or random magical energy, it needs to be invited into the body and channeled through movement: if you stop moving, then whatever effect you're aiming for will dissipate. This means that the best way to counter chakra users is to trap them suddenly. This is probably how large chakra beasts are dealt with. Also (especially if chakra users can heal themselves on the go) fights between chakra users will probably focus on immobilization techniques.

If incantations are required for a particular spell, then the incantation must be continuous.

Interestingly, Qi/Chi/Khi/Gi/Ki can be translated as "breath" and "energy /flow/", both terms that fit into this idea that magic users have to be moving in order to use their powers.

By the way, the Boxers had female counterparts, whose members were referred to as Red Lanterns, Blue Lanterns, and Black Lanterns depending on their age. "[Something] Lanterns" might be a good replacement term for "ninja."

Looking at other traditions:

- Feng Shui is about the placement and arrangement of things so as to balance qi. Maybe the placement and arrangement (and even color) of objects can direct the flow of qi, creating both low- and even zero-qi zones where qi use is impaired (another useful tactic against giant qi beasts, but primarily limited, I imagine, to when they invade cities or other places that you've had time to fortify) and high-qi zones where you can perform techniques that are otherwise impossible. In Feng Shui there is something called a /luopan/ or "compass, which detects the level and direction of qi flow.
- Qigong is the practice of "coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness [...] to cultivate and balance qi." It is also a form of medicine: Can qi become "corrupted"? If so, then even if qi can't heal people you might still need qi-medics who can keep people from being impaired or sickened by bad qi. Acupuncture might be part of this, with needles used to redirect the flow of qi. If so, then metal, wood, clay, or whatever the needles are made of might react to qi in other ways as well.

** Does anyone here know any immunologists/pathologists or is aware of someone who would be willing to help me craft a believable character working for the CDC or similar health organization which is studying diseases?

I have crafted a magical disease, and would like to go through some of the process a medical professional would use in categorizing and describing a new, virulent bacterium, and some of the methods they would use to study it.

*** I studied an introductory unit into epidemiology and one of the lectures was on outbreak investigation - how health professionals respond to and identify the cause of an outbreak. I suspect that's too early in the story though (before they identify it's an unknown disease). You may want to look into how they researched legionnaire's and HIV for inspiration.

** Working on a Choose Your Own Adventure series over on [[/r/makeyourchoice]] and I have a few things I am seeking advice with. As a general note, at the level of detail I am working at, it is almost like a really open ended single player pen and paper RPG, although the general format of CYOAs on [[/r/makeyourchoice]] encourages less text than RPG sourcebooks typically have, and the single player nature means you don't have to worry as much about mechanical balance, if someone wants to take over the world, let them, although, in the style of [[/r/rational]] I am sure trying to think in terms of other (NPC) people around the world also trying to leverage things.

So my main questions:

How do you strike a good balance between "flavor text"/"fluff" with mechanical descriptions of things "crunch"?

How do you communicate info about the setting, balancing between players that are trying to get every little advantage out of the choices, vs. players looking for a detailed and imaginative setting vs. players that are just casually playing through and don't want to deal with too many choices.

I am trying to work info about the setting into the choices and events and not just tell the players outright. For example, I have a pretty detailed magic system in mind, and I want to figure out how to give just enough detail that the players can work out/ imagine most of the results and implications of the magic system. Preferably enough so that most of the events in future episodes/missions will make sense. At minimum, enough do that the player's character and allies are neither underpowered or overpowered.

World building question: Recently in the modern world, magic egad come to exist. Magic use can be learned, although it is very difficult to teach anything beyond the basics, as it must be worked out and practiced/experimented with individually for each person. It takes a large time investment (several hours a day for several weeks or months ) just to get really minor results (limited astral projection, conjuring enough fire to light a candle, boosting intuition or charisma, creating a jinx to trip someone, etc.). At the high end, it might allow stuff like indefinite life extension for the magic user, personal pocket dimensions, conjuring matter from nothing, although each of these type of things would take, let's say, around ten thousand hours of practice, research, and the experimentation. Magic also has some risks associated with the high end stuff: getting lost in the astral plane and never returning to your body, damaging your nervous system or blood vessels from the inside out, etc. Also, for various metaphysical reasons, it is really hard to use magic to permanently effect things on a large scale in the real world (for example, an extremely well practiced, high-end magic user can carve out their own pocket dimension and micromanage the weather in it, but they can't fix global warming in the "real" world.) So, if magic like this appeared in the modern world, how many people would invest time into learning magic? (Before you say everyone, think of all the people that don't exercise properly, or have poor diets, or don't educate themselves, or are religious fundamentalists). What kinds of laws would emerge in the first several years of magic like this becoming possible? How would various governments react? Etc... For reasons specific to this CYOA series, I don't need brainstorming past the first 4-5 years after the emergence of magic(partly for spoiler reasons and mostly because I can leave it up to the players imagination)

**** Someone who got just the right powers due to another event in the setting might be able to dilate time by a factor of 2.5 and never need to sleep. These powers would tie up a portion of their magical capacity permanently however.

Otherwise... time dilation is one of those really high end things that would take thousands of hours to figure out. Being in a time dilated zone would mess with the connection with the astral plane in a way that would make many types of spells and make exploring the astral plane more dangerous.

So in terms of magical FOOM/singularity... maybe someone could try, but only after investing a huge amount of time into magic first.

** Finally making consistent, daily progress on my book. That does however mean that I've had to tackle an aspect of my worldbuilding I'm not very confident in.

When the main characters, who are mostly used to 17th century tech, explore the creepy old Hogwarts/Moria ruins of doom they run into a very simple computer. With the power of magic the computer can store holograms and voice recordings of the people who made it, but it's still basically just a Flow chart of Yes/No questions and a media archive less sophisticated than an mp3-player. I've tried to make their reactions to the thing realistic, and will continue to do so as they explore the +1940s science+ Ancient Lost Knowledge contained within it, but I'm definitely going to have to listen to the opinions of anyone I can get to read the first draft when it's done. Having your characters faced with something they have no reference points for is hard.

*** Congrats on making consistent progress! It's hard and you should be proud of yourself!

Are there any specific questions you'd like to ask? Your post and concept is interesting but it doesn't look like you have a specific question.

The thing I'm working on has a character meeting a vampire and he comes up with a bunch of theories - some quite implausible - for what the reason for his odd behaviour could be, because no matter how implausible the theory is, it's still more likely than "this guy is a vampire". I think that's what you'd need to do, get the people to use the stuff that's in their reference pane to justify the actions of the computer.

I think of Jumanji for this: when the pieces clip onto the board seemingly on their own, the characters in the '70s say "must be magnets"; the characters in the '90s say "must be microchips". If they live in a world where they see magic all the time, they're probably just going to assume it's enchanted in some way. If they live in our normal 17th century tech, they're probably going to relate it to mirrors/telescopes(?? I don't know exactly what tech level was at 17th century but for the purposes of my example let's go with that), or if they're in a theocracy, god/spirits/etc, lost magic artefact, etc. But probably they'd assume that it's a wizard of oz type contraption, with the hologram people in hearing range of them to answer questions, and appearing due to an "ingenious system of lenses and mirrors".
