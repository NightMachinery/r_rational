** Kind of going to go off topic here, but I just wanted to say that the reason I think the galactic authority, and all of Rick's other enemies have so much trouble dealing with him, is because they insist on treating him like a really really smart guy, and not like what he really is: a rogue super intelligence.

Rick, at least from a scientific stand point, is leagues smarter than almost any other character in the show, barring other Ricks. He invented trans-dimensional travel on Earth, building off of only Earth science. That alone should qualify him as a genius the likes of which have never been seen before.

He may not be artificial, but honestly the Galactic Authority would have fared a lot better if they just treated him like a general Artificial Intelligence. For example, in the season three premiere, if they had treated holding Rick a lot less like keeping a prisoner, and a lot more like an AI Box experiment, I think Rick would have had a much harder time winning.

Any thoughts?

*** The fact that there are basically infinite copies of/variations on Rick, all of whom have access to any given dimension due to their portal tech, adds weight to the AI comparison. In that sense, Rick is already "out of the box" no matter what they do. Even if they killed "the Rickest Rick", there'd still be any number of slightly-less-Rickish-Ricks out there. The only thing protecting the GA from an endless game of whack-a-Rick was that the other Ricks apparently didn't feel they had an incentive to fuck with them.

*** I think you're over-analyzing a bit. I mean, if we're taking the episode and what happens in it literally, then the guards executed code given to them by Rick with admin rights, their most wanted prison also has a central computer that controls the Federation's entire infrastructure with no passwords or checks, apparently you can transfer consciousness through a radio, etc. It's not like they failed because of a central flawed philosophy or anything like that. It's just Rick being the protagonist.

**** I was under the impression (though I may be wrong) that the code, simply by being transmitted up to them was executed, like it was a virus that took over the "transmit data from the memoryverse to the display screen" software. For example, something like a buffer overflow exploit followed by rewriting the software of the transfer thing. They didn't execute the code, the code was a basilisk to the computer that made it visible to them.

***** Also, they were fooled into thinking that they'd forcefully extracted the code from Rick, when in reality he placed it there specifically for them. It's not the equivalent of executing code /given/ to you by a boxed AI; it's the equivalent of executing code you /find/ while dissecting an AI (which, unbeknownst to you, was placed there for you to find by the AI).

*** I agree with that premise but then sapient greed comes in. The only proven way to win the AI Box experiment is to not interact with the AI. However, with Rick, they needed transdimensional technology and tried to use him to get it.

Were they not paranoid enough? Absolutely. But I also think their mistake is understandable considering the circumstances. They had Rick strapped into a chair that was liquefying his brain at a steady rate, holding him unconscious *AND* he was strapped down in every way possible. I don't think they're smart enough to reasonably predict Rick's hacking attempt. If they were, they wouldn't need Rick, because they'd be just as smart as he was.

** SPOILERS:

Yeah, the hostage situation was brilliant. The thing with Morty having a fake gun was kinda dumb though. Councilman!Rick could easily have double-tapped OneTrue!Rick without releasing Summer.

I think S2E6's most brilliant moment was when the guy went "This sounds like slavery... with extra... steps" then realized he was being an hypocrite, connected the dots and went n+1. It's especially great because we'd been shown earlier that Rick was completely blind to it.

*** SPOILERS:

The fake gun thing may have been flawed from a rationalist standpoint, but I think it was important from a narrative standpoint. Since Morty never noticed the note on the gun, his actions reinforced that he's prone to impulsive violence when pissed off (as we initially discovered in the Purge episode), and I suspect that that's building up to something in a future episode.

***** I honestly don't think "stupidity" is the right word for it. Morty's demonstrated that he's capable of thinking on his feet and coming up with out-of-the-box solutions. We know he's not bright academically and that he lacks Rick's particular brand of "mad science" genius, but I think there's more to his violent tendencies than just "he's stupid," even if those impulses sometimes drive him to do stupid things.

Also, something interesting I thought of when watching that episode. Technically speaking, Rick is their God. He's the guy that created them and they certainly wouldn't exist without him. So is he justified in using them as glorified slave labour? I suppose your answer to that would depend on where you fall on the debate about how much authority you have over an intelligent being as its creator.

**** Yeah, I didn't really care about the moral implications of this, more the Sci-Fi and how the characters reacted. I mean, you could spend hours debating it, but in the end most Rick & Morty episodes have very little parallels with realistic ethics. I mean, most of the time the realistic solution would be "Stop associating with Rick, he's a horrible person and he keeps killing people".

***** I wouldn't say that's what I believe; I moreso wonder how much "right" creating something gives you over said thing. Right and wrong is arbitrary for the most part. There's no such thing as absolute right or wrong. So if you had to pick one to be the "most" right, it would make some sense that you'd pick the Creator's view on said thing, as he'd be the one with the highest claim to making up the rules.

That's just one way of looking at it though. At the end of the day, if I truly adhere to my belief that there's no such thing as absolute right or wrong, then it's all meaningless anyway.

****** I think concern with "absolute" right and wrong is kind of misguided. People say "the universe doesn't have morality", but WE are part of the universe, and we have morality. I believe that there are objective moral claims that can be made, so long as you have some common definitions. Morality is concerned with well-being, by definition. If you grant that much, you can make a lot of positive claims about what is implied and what moral rules might exist. A being doesn't have the right to harm others just by stint of being more powerful or older, which is what the Creator claim is based on.

#+end_quote

True but, as we can see, Rick's prone to gloating and smugness. This trait gets him into trouble a *lot* (I'm specifically thinking about the Morty Jr episode, when he and Summer are talking to the all female race) so OneTrue!Rick relied on this well known character flaw. He even set it up by clarifying the specification on the gun; he subtly implied that the gun Morty held would one shot him no matter what by making it clear the gun HE held would definitely one shot Summer and only injure Councilman!Rick. Rick sets himself up and it works because OT!Rick isn't a part of the Council; he hasn't been lulled into a weaker position of safety by being part of a community and his skills and instincts are sharper as a result. In the same way that any feral human would totally kick a standard modern human's ass (excepting modern tools obviously)
