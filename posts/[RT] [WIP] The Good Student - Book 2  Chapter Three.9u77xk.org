**** Yes, I think so. But I'm really hoping it's Roke pulling a long term game with his perceptions for her own victory. Like the demon did last book, just much more subtlety and time involved.

*** I think she's intentionally trying to put personal feelings aside and become a major player. Its possible her unpleasantness to nic is a calculated counter to nic's infatuation.

When she says "what good can you possibly do?", I think that's a face value question about how ridiculous it is to her that large scale events are in the hands of someone who optimized for studying in order to get closer to his crush all his life.

She is outwardly a bitch, but I think that that is a good place for her character to be for many reasons. I feel like a lot of fics invevitable priotitize their worlds and outcomes being likeable, but this is a good way that the story can remain good with some counterbalance to that kind of plot sugaring

**** I'm very aware of what she's trying to do. She didn't need to explain anything as it is - this is something she more or less talked about in the last quarter of the last book. Either way, I don't think there's anything hidden behind her words or motivations in this case. She flat out stated that it should have been her in the last book as well.

It's nothing recent, on my part. I've always hated her character AND Nic's general interactions with and feelings for her. I'd have to admit he's also a part of why all her scenes have become so taxing. Inevitably, something to endure and plod through. Part of the problem I have is that I feel like I'm reading the exact same scene every time the two characters interact.

The other part is that the longer his feelings continue, the more bizarre and jarring they become to me, as a reader. At first it was hopeful, then it was sad. Eventually, it became weird and disgusting, especially considering all the events that have occured in the middle of this.

He's not particularly old, I don't believe his infatuation (or is it limerence?) should have lasted anywhere this long. It's very clearly not love (I don't even think romantic love should be possible given his age at the time of meeting and his subsequent history with the girl in question). I don't know what the author intended to add to the story with all of this, but I think it ran its course a long time ago and it has only detracted from it since, as far as I'm concerned.

EDIT: I should probably mention I have a small issue with how she behaves in general as well, given what we've seen with her and the rest of the people around her. She has never not come across as some sort of vengeful bully who operates on fear. The incident with the sausage in this chapter is indicative of that, and it's just one of many instances. So yes, while the MC's interactions with her contribute significantly to the unpleasantness, she's still just sort of odious all on her own.

***** His infatuation is magically derived, no?

I thought a demon overwrite him across years so that Dizzy is the absolute most attractive to him that any woman could possibly be. It's just that by the nature of this story, I'm not sure if that interpretation of the plot point is correct or not, nor if it's dropped now to be picked up later or just never touched on again.

****** I can't speak to this as there was a LOT of really abstract stuff that was kind of incomprehensible to me towards the end of the first book. I want to say that sounds familiar but that also might be me mixing it up with the MC from Worth The Candle.

Off the top of my head I can't remember how a demon would be mixed up in his early life, but you either remember better than I do, or you covered this more recently than I did. It's honestly been a very long time.

Can you go into the reason behind this? What was the point of causing this infatuation with her?

******* Started a reread very recently and I'm not there yet so it isn't super fresh. I think it's because Nic was always supposed to be the door according to the librarian's plan, and the manipulation was purely to bring him to Ransom and get him isolated and within the librarian's power frequently. (There may have been a part where Dizzy was part of some other demon's plan, so Nic would always go after her and be the door instead, but this one is less fuzzy.)

IIRC, Dizzy is actually not even particularly pretty. Like, she's /alright/, probably not even one of the prettier girls at the school. She's just a 25 out of 10 to Nic.

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8e67m0/rthf_the_good_student_chapter_fifty_two/dxun0su/][Here's a link to my old notes]], but I'm not sure how accurate they are, especially once the story gets more metaphorical.

******** Funny enough I remember coming across that post when I was reading it the first time through and being annoyed that no one confirmed or disputed anything there.

"Nic had been groomed for the other realm his entire life ^ ... by the crazy demon and librarian"

These two in particular i'm not entirely sure about - granted, it's strictly on fuzzy memory and nothing there setting them off. I'd have to go back to my original question of why? If, by crazy demon, you mean the original demon who opened the door (or created it? Or whatever) in the pyramid, I'd have to say this doesn't seem correct? Just because the demon did not seem familiar with Nic at all and actually did not like him as a "material."

If not, which crazy demon did you mean? Apart from that, what was their motivation for choosing Nic? Kind of a shame this is a summary. If you're keeping track really, maybe go back to this post every time you come across info and add in the chapter it appears in?

Haha, me too. I was hoping to get support, have other people throw out theories too, or even get countered on points. Bit disappointed it didn't generate any discussion.

I call the crazy demon the one that some people thought was the All-Mother and was captured by the government, then ended up sacrificing herself to become the door. You're right that she told him that she didn't like him at all, but I think that was before she went, "psyche, that was all just a double bluff to get you to consume me!" So my assumption is that she was lying before and really did plan it out.

The motivations for why they chose Nic in particular are either not revealed yet or hidden better than I can discern.

(EDIT: My only theory is that Nic /had/ to be the one, because killing a demon is hard and only so many people have the mindset to do it. He was born/prepared to have the rare combination of booksmarts, outlook on life, ability to figure out what it would take to kill the demon, while not being aware enough to understand the motivations.)

********** A theory I had was that Nic's obsession could be much more mundane than demons. Perhaps Dizzy's father did some kind of low level compulsion/brainwashing to make sure Nic respected Dizzy without ever being able to take it too far. Perhaps Nic's presence which is inexplicable otherwise given the status difference was meant to inoculate dizzy to experience with boys.

​

Along those lines perhaps as mentioned the goal was to get Dizzy's father in the position we saw him at by the end of book 1. There was no way to directly influence him but they tried to get at his daughter. And thus they manipulated events to ensure they'd have an agent of some kind (Nic) preloaded with various compulsions to stay near the family.

​

The librarian certainly seems to indicate she'd foreseen Nic or Dizzy possibly stepping up to the role. It's also clear that the mages including the archmage are likely aware that Winnum Roke was the figure meant to come back. Now that we know all the demons have crossed over and have been making mages for thousands of years that kind of long term long range planning from rogue demon factions unhappy with the stopgap measure put in place could have orchestrated events the culmination of which involve nic being who he is.
