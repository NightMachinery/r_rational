After an encounter with an isekai protagonist, a group of wizards/artificers have been informed about the properties of electromagnetism. They decide to attempt to use a lightning bolt spell to power the railgun, due to the massive amount of energy discharged in a lightning bolt.

Assume that a single non-upcast lightning bolt spell (from D&D 5e) is used to provide the electrical energy for the weapon, and that the weapon is properly built and enhanced so that it does not explode when fired. How powerful would its shots be?


** It's not well-defined. The spell does the same amount of damage to creatures of different sizes or different chemical makeups.

And it's "100 feet long and 5 feet wide"? Huh?

  [[http://www.weatherimagery.com/blog/lightning-facts/][The average lightning bolt is 6 miles long, although Cape Canaveral Kennedy Space Center has indicated some as long as 75 miles. The thickness of a lightning bolt is about the size of a silver dollar.]]
#+end_quote

Each part of the description either gives contradictory information about how much energy is in the bolt, or else no information or extremely vague information.

You're not going to be able to come up with reasonable values, but my guesstimate is that it'll be totally useless as a railgun. [[https://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-space/article/2008-02/navy-tests-32-megajoule-railgun/][Real-world efforts are in the range of tens of megajoules of energy]], which seems like a lot more power than a lightning bolt spell.

*** It seemed that the main factor is the fact that the lightning bolt has enough energy to kill a human on contact. 8d6 damage is an average damage of 28, and if an average human is assumed to have 10 HP, that's easily enough to be lethal. By comparison, actual lightning bolts have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_injury][listed mortality rate of 10-30%]], and are estimated to contain a gigajoule of energy.

Yes, there is likely some secondary element of magic channeling the electricity into a line, and yes, a single lightning bolt spell likely wouldn't be enough power for a grand ship-mounted railgun. But even a small fraction of that power would make a terrifying siege weapon in a fantasy setting.

**** Being more lethal doesn't necessarily have to correspond to containing more energy. For all we know the lightning bolt spell has some additional magic woven into it that makes it more likely to hit vital organs or maybe it's more efficient in terms of how much energy it loses to the atmosphere.

Also note that the energy released by a lightning strike is not the same as the amount of useful energy you can get out of it.

***** Good point, lethal =! more energetic. It could just have a better voltage/amperage ratio to disrupt nervous systems(your biological pacemaker in particular). This would be a decent explanation for why most creatures get hurt the same, especially with all the intelligent creatures in DnD. For non-innervated creatures maybe it disrupts their innate magical "nervous system" or something.

****** I think the most important question to resolve is the targeting, lightning is just electricity grounding itself, and the lightning spell doesn't ground itself on the first target let alone before it reaches the first target. So depending on how targeting is achieved, leading a charge around by creating a path of minimal resistance, or creating a set of positive/negative charges that annhilate each other, then lethality would probably be a matter of making sure the spell targets the heart.

None of this really relates to voltage or wattage. I do mechanical/technical work and I was talking to an ex HVDC electrician a few months ago, and he showed me a picture he took on a job site where a kid accidentally grounded a high voltage transformer or something from his shoulder to the back of his skull, blew the back of his skull right off and simultaneously cauterized the exposed brain, the kid lived but got knocked out.

******* So basically my point would be that the lightning bolt spell probably doesn't deal with a massive amount of energy, and that if they're rational these wizards would move onto other methods of energy generation, like setting up a turbine between two gateways to the elemental plane of water or something.

******* You're right that targeting is important, but I don't think it's the most important part. A lot of electrical shocks go through the heart incidentally, since most of the time the electricity will ground to the ground. So if it starts at your hand or head it's passing through your heart on it's route down. The most significant factor is how much damage it does to your heart and nervous system, which is determined by the overall energy and voltage/amperage.

You can look at some non-faraday cage magic tricks with tesla coils for examples of electricity with high energy tuned not to harm, or defibrillator's for low energy tuned to stop hearts.

***** Kinda makes you wonder if it'd be possible for a magic-user to create a lightning bolt spell which only needed a tiny bit of energy vs opponents for lethal or near-lethal results because it had a neural targeting component.

One-tenth the magic power, ten times the lethality. Far less destructive vs non-living targets, of course - it'd be more like a strong taser to the brain, heart, and spine than an actual lightning strike.

** Getting clever with the tools available is such a staple of tabletop RPGs that I don't think you have any grounds on which to forbid this outright. The Rule of Cool is strong here.

Enough "realistic" analysis on the physics of lightning has been given, so I'll try to answer from another angle: Game balance. If your wizard is dumping a lightning bolt into firing the railgun, then the easiest call to make is for the railgun to also do 8d6 damage. The railgun mechanism just changes the description, not the numbers. But that's boring.

Mechanically, I would expect the railgun to change the damage type to piercing, and for it to require a ranged attack roll. If it's a standard fantasy setting, then /nobody/ is proficient with this new weapon, though your players could earn proficiency after they accidentally blow up an orphanage or two with it. Since the railgun projectile is very definitely NOT a magical effect, spell resistance doesn't apply anymore. The railgun got hit with the spell, not the target.

Beyond that, though, there's plenty of opportunity to tweak things. I'm not familiar with siege engine mechanics in D&D. Do they allow saving throws for half damage, or do you just have to hope your AC is up to the task? Given that deploying the railgun, loading it, and firing it will probably take a crew (I'm picturing the party ranger as the operator), it might be fair to give it a few more d6 of damage. Or since it allows someone else to make the attack roll for the wizard, take a d6 or two back. If they have access to bags of holding and can deploy the railgun just by turning the bag upside down and shaking it vigorously, it might be worth less damage.

You might simply have to adjust the rules as you go. Be upfront and honest with your players about it and let them know that you reserve the right to adjust the mechanics over time. I definitely want to hear how it works out though. Tell us all about the orphanges they blow up.

EDIT: I just realized, on a second reading, that this may have been a purely hypothetical question, and not related to an ongoing game. My "because game balance said so" post doesn't fit so well the rational-fic virtues this subreddit strives towards. I leave this comment here as a monument to my own lack of reading comprehension.

*** It'd certainly make it easier to treat the railgun as a fixed-emplacement lightning-bolt maximizer or booster. A caster with sufficient weapons knowledge (or teaming up with someone with that knowledge) can effectively fire a five-fold (or whatever) strength lightning bolt for the same mana cost... as long as they're crewing the gun and the gun is sufficiently undamaged.

You might also have some factor along the lines of the gun can be fired at a fixed target as fast as there are mages able to dump lightning spells into it... as long as it doesn't need to be retargeted or the vessel it's on doesn't move. Targeting (or retargeting) might take a round or so.

** A quick Wikipedia skim indicates that an average [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvesting_lightning_energy][lightning bolt]] "carries a relatively large amount of energy (approximately 5 billion joules). However, this energy is concentrated in a small location and is passed during an extremely short period of time (microseconds); therefore, extremely high electrical power is involved. 5 billion joules over 10 microseconds is equal to 500 trillion watts. Because lightning bolts vary in voltage and current, a more average calculation would be 10 billion watts." (10 000 megawatts).

Currently, "it would require 25 megawatts to propel a projectile to the desired maximum range (i.e., to launch 32MJ projectiles at a rate of 10 shots per minute)" with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun][railgun]].

From what I can [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-voltage-and-amperage-of-an-average-lightning-bolt][find]] "the peak current for over 98% of all cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strikes ranged between 5 kA - 200 kA", so that's 5000 to 200 000 amperes. A railgun needs 6 million amps of current.

This means some kind of capacitors would need to be used.

** Lightning bolt duration is instantaneous, so it doesn't last long enough to power a rail gun. The gun simply fails to fire. No you can't get around it by adding energy storage mediums because they need time to charge as well. You'd need something with a duration (maybe there's a version that sets up a field lasting x rounds).

As for how effective it would be, the way d&d rules work I'm pretty sure it is exactly as effective as an ability of an equivalent level to the spell being used to power it.

*** The premise of this idea is that a lightning bolt is an inefficient way to use energy to kill people, since people get struck by the ludicrous amount of energy in a lightning bolt and survive the impact a majority of the time. So yes, converting the electrical energy into kinetic energy wouldn't increase the total energy available, but makes the energy much more efficient for causing damage (as it's in the form of a kinetic projectile instead of ionized particles that pass through the victim).

** Personally I assume things like this are going on "behind the scenes" all the time with spells, wizardry is always described as very complex so I assume if you piece apart the spell matrices and interpret them through modern physics you'd find stuff like ionization paths and low pressure zones and such like to get the most out of every spell meaning further optimization would be difficult and require wise mage... But that isn't actually relevant since it would be optimized for casting without tools. I guess what I'm saying is that an isekai wouldn't necessarily be necessary, infact I could imagine a whole class of reverse magic wands, semi mundane items that can produce a major effect if used with a variant of a common spell. So in this case something like

Magnetic tuning fork: A complex cradle of metal and rubber with two long rods of an unusual alloy, when a specialty metal slug is placed in the cradle, after turn of uninterrupted focus is used to aim it the wizard using it can use a variant of Lightning Bolt to propel the metal slug. *Insert stats about range, damage and accuracy*

Cold condenser: A system of glass vials, tubes and valves with which a wizard can over an hour and after casting a specialized version of Cone of Cold condense a clear smoking liquid out of the air into specially made metal vials. *Insert stats about damage uses and utility uses*

Rod of the Seige Mage: A heavy, stocky metal tube, a wizard can use a specialized version of Fireball of the 4th level or higher to launch a Fireball of one level lower to 10 times the normal range using this object.

Further delaying vial: A ceramic vial rapped with metal bands and using 10GP worth of rubies in crafting. A wizard can use these to contain a delayed blast fireball without using concentration indefinitely though each has a 1 in 20 chance to detonate every hour a wizard doesn't spend a turn suppressing it. If shattered the spell ends immediately with normal effects with an additional 1d12 piercing damage.
