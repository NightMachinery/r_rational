*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the biweekly challenge. Post recommendations, ideas, brainstorming, and so on below.*

I think humaniform robots are used in science fiction for two main reasons. First, it's very practical; you can have your android be played by a human actor, and the visuals are easy because you shoot your scenes very much like you would shoot a scene between any two humans. The same goes for prose; there's an established structure for how you write a conversation between two people which is easy to borrow. If you have an artificial intelligence that communicates through a command line, you can't use expressions like 'raised an eyebrow' or anything like that.

Second, it's a way to isolate what the author wants to talk about. If you're writing a story that revolves around the barrier between truth and fiction, or about the human condition, or something else like that, it can be harder to get to the meat if you first have to cross a few other conceptual gaps. Differences in form can obscure differences in cognition. Same goes for mediums of communication obscuring the differences in message.

But of course when you start to think about them, androids have a whole bunch of technical issues that would appear to be wholly separate from the technical issues involved with creating something that's remotely like a human mind, which makes them troubling from a worldbuilding perspective. In /Ex Machina/ the android's creator is a master of both biological simulacra /and/ artificial minds. Same goes for /Star Trek/, but with the more unbelievable addition that Data is one of only a few prototypes ever created. The BBC series /Humans/ is a little more realistic, in that there are clearly "dumb" humaniform robots which have impacted the world, but then there are smart ones created by a genius inventor.

(If you write for this challenge, I don't expect for you to solve this worldbuilding conundrum.)


** I actually came up with a backstory for them in a sci-fi setting I never used where they were content slaves ala not-Dobby house elves. When it first became possible to genetically engineer humans, human traffickers created the perfect slave who genuinely valued their master's life over their own. The public was horrified and cracked down on the practice, eventually destroying the entire industry.

However, the practice of creating them was eventually legalized at the request of the slaves themselves. They said they didn't want to go down in history as a mistake, they wanted to be allowed to live and reproduce even if their purpose in life was to serve others. In the end, the public relented due to the prospect of technically committing genocide and established laws to prevent abuse.

*** That scenario sort of assumes that every single country has the same laws and the same cultural reactions to a radical new technology.

** I'm pretty sure there's a joke about ANDroids and NANDroids (along with ORroids, XORoids, and the like). Probably somebody better than me can think up a punchline.
