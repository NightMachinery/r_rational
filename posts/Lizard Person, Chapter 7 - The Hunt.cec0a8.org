** Another chapter! Some meta-ish author's notes:

Despite being much more free to write during the summer (I am a graduate student), this chapter took quite a bit of time to produce. The truth is that, while I had a few solid characters and a vague-ish destination for the overall plot in mind, I never successfully sat down and nailed down how it would all work out. That's not to say I didn't /try./ I've spent (way too) many afternoons stressing about this little side project of mine. I kept telling myself that it was okay, that many authors prefer the 'gardening' technique of plotting, but my own story was fighting against me.

So now, after about a year (!), there's actually a plot structure. I have a story, and it's just up to me not to mess it up. I'm slightly afraid knowing the structure might negatively affect my writing (see the last three seasons of a certain fantasy TV series), but anything's worth it if I can just h*cking write, no more per-chapter restructuring. For funsies, my current estimate for the total length is 26 chapters.

As always, I still have a lot to learn, and this chapter was pretty different, so make sure to nuke that sub button and drop a comment below to tell me what you think.

Edit: I made a minor change to the part where Carol stands up to Rose at the end. Same general event happens, but the conversation is less nonsensical.

** I'm slightly angry, mostly because this brings back memories of team games back in school.

Well done, and a welcome surprise to see this update :D
