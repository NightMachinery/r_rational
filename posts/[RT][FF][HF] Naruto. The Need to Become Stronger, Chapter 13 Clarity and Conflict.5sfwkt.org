** All right, time for some action! I have to say, I'm really curious to see how you guys like this chapter - since it's the first one with real ninja combat.

I wanted to emphasize the sheer /speed/ and lethality of ninja combat in my writing (which is what you would expect from rational ninjas who are actually trying to kill each other), as opposed to the dull "and he punched the other guys forehead with his left arm, and the other guys said 'ow you bastard!' as he kicked at the hero, and then..."

(And of course, rational ninjas wouldn't be so nice as to just show up and go "Hi I am here to kill you shall we fight?" No, they would use things like Haku's ice mirror to gain an actual /tactical advantage/, instead of just using it as an attack technique.)

Let me know if my combat writing style worked for you or not.

*** Great chapter! We really see the payoff from the slow-paced buildup of the mission. Haku's surveillance and clever planning has paid off, while Kakashi's Constant Vigilance has allowed him to survive the first strike. Both sides have wasted resources on initial strikes that didn't pan out, and now we're set up to have an epic confrontation where our heroes will hopefully escape by the skin of their teeth and show everyone that... well-preparedness saves lives? That our protagonists' mercenary military dictatorship is morally superior? I'm not sure what the moral of the arc will be, but I am sure thag you already know!

*** Hm, I'm getting the impression that an important part of Ninja combat is knowing how much MP to spend on "extra lifes" that are solid clones (kindof) rather than other techniques

**** Hah, yeah, resource management is incredibly important for ninjas, as part of countless snap-decisions regarding your opponent's abilities relative to your own, risk-reward trade-offs with respect to your objectives and lightning-fast experimentation by using techniques and seeing how your opponent counters them. Realistically the skill-cap for ninjas would be insanely high I think - I could write a whole book about optimal ninja strategies, probably.

In fact, I think I'll have a couple scenes about the subject, later on in the story. There should be some interesting material in there, and I'm getting the impression that quite a few people would like to see more explicitly rational material in the story anyway.

** Oh, I totally forgot to mention this, but... as the story is intended to be solvable in the same way as HPMOR, it should be totally possible to figure out what Zabuza and Haku are really up to. Anyone care to venture a guess before the answer is revealed in the next chapter?

You earn instant rationality points if you get it right!
