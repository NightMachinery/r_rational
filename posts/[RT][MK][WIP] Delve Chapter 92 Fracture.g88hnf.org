** Did this chapter feel really short and kinda half there to anybody else?

*** The pure numbers chapters aren't doing much for me. I'm looking forward to when he gets out of the hole and back to the plot.

*** There's a really active Discord channel about this story which can help with the lull in between chapters. There's a lot of theory crafting that goes on.

Here's a link for anyone who might want to join that's good for a day or until April 28th: [[https://discord.gg/B6nCS8]]

** The slime is getting me really excited. Either Rain's going to find a way to increase his level cap and make his own safe and easy to kill high level blues by pumping a weak slime full of mana(notice Dozer took 100 mana, at level 1. Hmmm), or he's going to raise an incredibly powerful pet and pump all his excess EXP/Mana into him, and maybe we'll get a second Slime god. If only updates happened quicker, I'd really love to see what loophole Rain creates and exploits quicker.

** The slime is interesting. Essence well does /something/ to it. I wonder if it's related to essence monsters.

I guess now isn't the time to try it, but I'd like to see what happens if he dumps a full mana bar into the smile via essence well. The ability to create tamed Essence Monsters would be a gamechanger.

--------------

I'm also very glad that he's breaking down the wall with hydraulics. I was not at all a fan of the 'work out until you have the strength to move boulders' plan, so this one seems a lot smarter. The old plan would see him dead of starvation before any meaningful gains, but this should probably work.

Also thermal shock should work on stone too. I know that extended periods of cooking can make stone incredibly brittle, but mageburn might be a concern. However, you /could/ do something like heat up everything within 3 meters, and then strongly cool down the nearby areas within 1 meter. So that the far side of the stone keeps getting hot and the close side gets really cold. The temperature differential should cause the stone to break if he can keep it up long enough to affect it (which I think he can).

Not sure if it would be faster than hydraulics, but might be a nice backup if he runs into any stones he can't get dig a fissure into.

*** Can also consider to alternate auras.

Snap heating/cooling would crack most stuff.

Then fill the cracks with water and freeze them open.

** If he can't figure out what to do with the slime after all this is over, I think it'd be pretty cute to offer it to Ameliah as a birthday present or something. A level 50 slime god pet pal for her to take on her adventures would be hilarious. Or offer it to Talheart. It would be the perfect companion. Doesn't talk. Doesn't poop. Can store money. Itd be great.
