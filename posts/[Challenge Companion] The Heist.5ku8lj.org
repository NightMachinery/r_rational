*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the weekly challenge. Post recommendations, ideas, questions, or whatever else tickles your fancy.*

One of the things that I've always liked about heists is that the protagonists are acting proactively throughout. The protagonists are the ones who set the ultimate objective and figure out all the ways of getting past whatever defenses are in place that keep them from it. There also tends to be a very constrained narrative structure; get the team together, each with their special skills, do some work to prepare, then have the caper itself where things inevitably go wrong in order to keep some dramatic tension (or sometimes just appear to go wrong).

I'm not aware of any heist stories that I would call /rational/ per our genre definition, though obviously there are some that actually happened in the real world and presumably took a lot of planning, social engineering, and careful thought. /The Great Train Robbery/ by Michael Crichton is a semi-fictionalization of an actual train robbery that took place in 1855, and there are lots of other "true crime" stories where you'll at least be assured that nothing is happening purely for the sake of plot.

One of my favorite things about the heist is that it can be blended into whatever weird genre you want it to be in. /Mistborn/ has been described as "Ocean's 11 after the dark overlord won". /Inception/ is a reverse heist into someone's mind (with the opening and the comic prequel being proper heists). /The Lies of Locke Lamora/ series is to some extent a fantasy caper series, though it's got lots of other elements and varies from book to book. And the heist is pretty much a mainstay of cyberpunk, for obvious reasons.


** MfD(Marked for Death) missions are a lot like heists, except there's a natural dramatic tension inherent in each mission, partly because it's a game, which means that it's unpredictable what the ending will be, or whether the outcome is a success.

** An assassination is almost like a heist, except instead of taking something from a protected place, you often leave something, like a knife, arrow, bullet, or bit of poison.

Heists are often easier to justify on moral/heroic levels, though not always, when compared with assassination.

*** Man, there should really be more heroic assassination movies. Not even dark grey morality movies, but just movies where the job of the heroes is to assassinate clearly bad people who are clearly making the world significantly worse by their continued living status.

**** Have you ever seen Remo Williams: the adventure begins? 80s movie with the actress who played Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrue).

Totally in that category.

***** I loved that movie.

The books it was based on ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Destroyer_(novel_series][The Destroyer]]" series) are a lot of fun. Cranked out by ghostwriters and formulaic to the point of literally copy/pasting paragraphs between books, wildly unrealistic, often funny, and generally tremendous fun.
