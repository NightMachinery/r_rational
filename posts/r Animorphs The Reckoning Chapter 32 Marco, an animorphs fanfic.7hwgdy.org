*** Timeline:

- David freaks out after the Andalite meteor threat is identified and is horrified that everyone decides to stay on Earth. He makes an anonymous internet posting offering the morphing cube for sale.

- Visser Three finds the post and offers to double whatever offer he's already received. David turns traitor and tells the Visser about the Animorph's plan to monitor him during one of his regular trips.

- David goes with Marco to the recon and manages to convince him to let David be the one in morph, where he holds a thoughtspeech convo with the Visser, telling him to act harmless and not shoot anything. The Visser acts like he's feeding (and doesn't do whatever it is he was /actually/ traveling there for).

- On the ambush mission, Visser Three wipes the floor with everyone and brings out a Leeran to interrogate his prisoners. Everyone during this period can read one another's thoughts and memories, and can see the entire five-minute timeline of the interrogation from the beginning.

- Visser Three discovers the location of the cube, the apparent Chee treachery, and the Telor/Ax pairing, which he decides is actually a threat to him.

- Marco discovers David's betrayal, that the Andalite meteor was never a problem, and both he and Visser Three connect the dots and realize that Visser One's host is Marco's abducted mother.

- (also, one of the gods apparently made an important conclusion from its time in the Animorph's heads? Either that or the Visser made a conclusion, that part's not super clear.)

- the Visser infests David with one of his almost-but-not-quite-ready clones, and apparently kills Marco, Tobias, and Jake.

  The stopped time was an illusion
#+end_quote

I thought that was obvious, given that Cassie was teleported right back where she started before the time-stop, back to her Hork-Bajir morph, which implied that this was her "default state", and everything else was an illusion. (I also think the canon time-stops were illusions too, not sure).

I didn't realize before reading this chapter that no-one else had connected the dots, since Cassie died alone and from the others' perspectives (except Tobias), time stopped and then they were immediately teleported elsewhere.

I was able to understand all of these revelations when reading the chapter. Although, how did Marco realize that his mind was altered when morph checking David? Was it an inference he made, or did he directly witness it in the Leeran hypersight? Also, it appears that the Leeran hypersight can show the future. That... no, even without that ... Leeran hypersight is too powerful. There's no way that evolved naturally. I bet it's another thing that's implemented with the help of the gods.

It's a linear ~5 minute conversation, except all the involved individuals can read one another's thoughts and memories, and see the end of that 5 minute period from the beginning. The Visser finds out where the cube is, finds out about Telor in Ax, finds out that Marco's mother is Visser One, takes sundry other intel I'm sure, then infests David with his clone and (apparently) kills the others.

****** Yes, it has. In canon, Leerans were intrusive psychics, which is to say they could read your thoughts, unlike the more passive Andalites who could universally /send/ but not universally read. This was used as a throwaway threat once or twice, since a Leeran-Controller could detect Animorphs easily, and could also tell that they were not Andalite bandits as they so claimed.

An important caveat was that this was simply the way the Leerans communicated, so when the team morphs Leerans, they found themselves unintentionally reading each other's minds, which was a bit stressful considering the amount of emotional baggage that all of them went through great pains to cover up.

In The Reckoning, this effect was turned up to 11 as sort of a field that surrounds each Leeran. All (presumably sapient) creatures within the field can perceive one another utterly, from just about all possible ways it is possible to perceive someone in. Visser Three keeps one or two nearby on hand, presumably drugged or what have you, to be pulled out whenever he's willing to risk the two-way information transfer.

The Visser mentioned using it occasionally to vet people, and he's definitely used it during negotiations with e.g. the Arn, so that all sides can tell that no one is lying. It's the perfect diplomatic tool, so long as you're not /actually/ planning on betraying anyone (or have any huge secrets you'd rather keep) , and it's the reason the Visser is so set on the dog thing; for him to have actually convinced the Chee he would have to /actually/ believed that's what he was going to do.

It came up in the story before Ventura was destroyed; the Visser pulled one out on Rachel since he didn't have time for anything else (IIRC), which let him confirm the Animorphs' existence and also discover the Chee if I'm not mistaken. In return however Rachel got a brief glimpse into /his/ mind.

It's important to note that the temporal perception is just that, a matter of perception. In this chapter, at least seven people were all in the field at once, but all of them perceived one another utterly, as if they were that person. Thus, since so many of them were mostly rational, analytical actors, they were able to intuit what was going to happen, but even if only one of them figured it out (Alloran), the others would soon get an echo of it and see it themselves.

Actually, how many /were/ there? You can fit a lot of Visser Three clones in a small area, and all (save one) of them being convinced something was true would have a huge impact on the hypersight, not to mention giving him lopsided control over what information was transferred.

V3 used a Leeran for a brief instant to find Rachel and the Chee when they were hidden/cloaked in the high school.

V3 used a Leeran (offscreen, but referenced) to establish trust with the Arn, so that they'd /really truly get/ the fact that he would never interfere with them, if they helped him conquer the universe.

V3 used a Leeran to read the minds of Yeerks from Telor before eating them.

Otherwise, what ketura said. It's made more confusing by the fact that the characters see events before they happen (or, well, their perception of time and memory gets screwed with enough that they feel like they're seeing the future). So even though David doesn't get infested until the end of the scene, it's narrated several times throughout the scene.

I just noticed that all of the chosen Animorphs are (apparently) dead. Jake, Marco, Cassie, and Tobias were the four in the original time-stopping intervention. Leaving Rachel, Ax, and Garrett, who were not "chosen ones." So the question is, was this moment the purpose of the Animorphs all along? Or was it a maneuver by the other god?

If God1 saved the Animorphs at the Yeerk pool, then I'm assuming that God2 caused David to join the Animorphs in response for the purpose of the betrayal.

Prediction: In the next chapter, God1 will do a time-stopping intervention with Rachel and give her a chance to save the Animorphs or defeat Visser 3 or something. In canon, Crayak gave Rachel superpowers and pitted her against David, so there's precedent.

She always nailed getting them just the right amount of delightfully grotesque. That gave me nostalgia harder than anything yet in the fic, which I've generally enjoyed for almost exactly the opposite reasons as the original.

I... don't know what to do with that final scene? I didn't understand what happened at all. I don't know who the evil morph god is? It felt like it was Visser, but that makes zero sense. It seems completely hopeless, but that's just because it felt like that to Marco. Looking forward to the next chapter!

Wow.

Did V3 just wipe out Jake, Marco, and Tobias? No way. Three main characters annihilated? If true, that's a really, really bold move. But I'm skeptical. There must be a reason that Marco's mother is Visser 1. Unless that reason has already been spent?

I mean, there are also morph backups of everyone - you could resurrect them all with some volunteers or with the Visser's tech...

Anyway, this chapter was jaw-dropping. Me, reading the chapter: uh oh, uh oh, this isn't gonna go well, don't do it Marco, don't bring David, oh crap this is gonna go very poorly, uh oh, uh oh, AHHHHHHHHHHHH MY WORST NIGHTMARES ARE HAPPENING.

*** My take is that Marco's mother likely took the place of Loren from canon, which is to say she's the reason that the Yeerks know about earth at all. It's much more smooth that she's abducted by Skrit Na, which what do you know, they somehow end up crossing paths with Yeerks, alerting them to their presence. One infested ship later, they've got navigational data and a /very/ valuable set of memories from an exotic species.

The Yeerk social structure is much different from canon, so I'm curious as to why the human would be used as a host for what is essentially the commander-in-chief of all Yeerkdom. The political power struggles wouldn't be as present, the individual prestige less of a desired thing, and I doubt Visser One spent a decade on earth preparing it as she did in canon. Perhaps it's merely foresight? Making a gamble on stealing seven billion hosts, the Yeerks are likely to inflate their numbers by a few orders of magnitude, so having their head honcho shard extremely familiar with the limitations of a human is important fundamental knowledge.

That said, with how Aftran turned out it might result in an interesting relationship back home. Wouldn't it just be /poetic/ if /both/ of Marco's parents were eventual voluntary hosts, one for personal reasons and one for the greater good, while he himself died fighting it?

3) So when Marco starts commiserating about horrible fathers, David thinks he might see the "why" of Marco's coverup, and further suspects that maybe Marco is a little bit "like him," so he opens up a little and is honest, and Marco supports that, so he opens up more.

4) But he still doesn't "owe" Marco anything, because Marco stunned him and let him suffer through the broadcast and is trying to keep him trapped on a planet where he'll DIE, so ... acknowledgement that this guy did some nice things, it was nice that he was understanding about me being a cold-blooded ice machine, but also that's not going to get in the way of doing what it takes to survive.

In canon, certainly, David is a play by Crayak, both to destroy the animorphs and later to corrupt Rachel. Any potential role reversal in Reckoning shouldn't eliminate the fact that he's a (deliberately designed) dangerous piece on the board, and one that both gods would seek to use against the other.

Also to note, I don't think esplin would have a usable dead-man's switch for use against his clones, both for reasons of personality and the fact that his clones would know about it.

** What the hell. Super long review time!

- Marco is being a bit of a jerk to Tobias here. It's because he's jealous that Tobias gets to do more protagonist stuff than him.

- The Animorphs are playing this game of "have a secret telepathic conversation while pretending to do nothing" which strikes me as a little silly. I mean, it's not like everyone else doesn't already know that they're colluding and making plans, and they're all mostly allies, so these "pretend you're asleep" games seem a bit pointless.

- "David continued playing cute in front of not-Tyagi" Yeah, I can imagine the dialogue. Tyagi: "..." David: "..." Tyagi: "So... did you have fun murdering your father?"

- I'm really curious what Esplin could be doing going around the planet. Seeding pandemics seemed to be the obvious answer, but Esplin wouldn't need to stay for hours to do that; I didn't consider he could be feeding, but I like the idea (except it turned out to be fake)

- How precise is the positional data on the Marauder's map, and how easy is it to see? Because if it's precise down to a few meters, wouldn't Rachel have been able to see that Esplin stayed in his ship on all trips except the decoy trip? Unless he does usually get out of his ship for some other reason.

- Marco considers the possibility of creating an incident to distract the military from attacking Esplin... would that even work? I mean, these guys have a lot of officers. The president doesn't need to do everything herself, they can delegate and multitask.

- "I believe Mars is approximately two hundred million of your miles" THEY'RE EVERYONE'S KILOME... oh, wait, never mind. Carry on.

- Garett knows that it can be really hard for the reader to guess who's talking if we don't get their names. Thank you, Garett. No, seriously, I loved his outburst. That's so /him/.

- I think Marco is starting to break down a bit. Like, he doesn't have enough information, everything's getting more complicated, so he's trying to find patterns and meaning everywhere. The bit about how things are moving fast "THEREFORE IT'S PROBABLY GOD" sounds a little... over-reaching? On the other hand, he's right that they're acting way too fast and not taking their time nearly enough. Also, I think he's starting to automatically distrust Tobias and Rachel, or to expect the worst from them.

- Didn't Ax report Elfangor as dead? The Andalite high command is going to get crazy over that recording.

- "Oh, by the way, I given the natives the nuke codes and the coordinates of our homeworld. You're welcome!"

- Quick question: do most Andalite soldiers even know their world's coordinates? I mean, if you gave /me/ a chart of the Milky Way, I'd have a hard time pinpointing where we are. Space is huge. If the Andalites were worried about planetary annihilation, the strongest defense is not letting anyone know where their planet is (which I think was a recurrent plot in Stargate). That would probably require setting up one or more outposts, which would be the only offworld structures with the homeworld's coordinates; ships would be unable to get back to the homeworld without getting to the outpost first. That way, nobody can get them by decrypting a ship's navigation log, or interrogating an officer.

- Ax mentions that the "Do we blow the Earth up?" question is being debated by the Andalite government or something. They're treating it as a "don't count on it" thing... but, even this the debate process takes time, there's no way the Andalites will go ahead with their threat now, right? Elfangor claimed that humans had the means to retaliate if the Earth blew up. Even if the Andalites decide it's probably a hoax, they obviously can't take the chance it isn't. There's no way they'd blow up the Earth without at least asking Tyagi for tangible proof they can't shoot back, political rut or not.

- I like the hypocrisy of Elfangor going "We must not be cowards and kill so many people to protect our own hides" after he totally tried to do that.

- Andalite memory-copying is OP. Please nerf.

- Wait, Elfangor believes in trickle-down warfare? I can't take him seriously anymore.

- Okay, wait a sec, they're sending clone!Tyagi in the Yeerk pool? That's... "Ahah, you tried to kidnap me to your giant spaceship, but I'm going into your giant spaceship myself instead! Bet you didn't see that coming!" But seriously, what the hell? Why are they suddenly giving all of Tyagi's intelligence to Telor, free of charge? This one doesn't have earplugs or anything, right?

- I feel like Marco and David are bad influences on each other. Not sure what gave me this feeling; might be something about what they said about how it was /totally okay to murder David's father/.

- We get more details on the relationship between Marco and his dad. It's cool; it's a natural extension on what we're told in canon, but with more attention drawn to it.

- Should they really be taking David on any important missions? Extenuating circumstances or not, he's 10-yo, he has no combat experience, and he's killed his father. I mean, inevitable betrayal aside, I feel like they should be sending him to a therapist, not in a war zone. It's not like they're short on minions, given that they have the Chee, the US military, and all the people they gave powers to to recruit from.

- Wait, Esplin is still hairless? I thought he'd let his fur grow since his first interlude. (he mentioned looking at his blue fur or something?)

- The whole scene with Marco hearing about Esplin running around in the forest, being terrified, waiting for the other shoe to drop was really tense and overall really cool.

- Jake mentions that the Chee won't work with the military. That's interesting, and way under-explored. First off, Tyagi hasn't mentioned the Chee yet, but she knows about them. That's pretty huge. "Ancient super-powerful have been living with us for millenia" is overall weirder and scarier than the alien invasion. There's probably a whole intelligence branch that dedicated specifically to figuring out /anything/ about them. So... did the government contact the Chee? They've definitely tried, at least. Did the Chee refuse to have any contact with them? If they did communicate, how did the negotiations even go?

- The Animorphs mention several time blowing up Serenity, and eventually go through with it. That seems to me like a horribly, horribly bad idea. Serenity was the one big advantage the USA had on the Yeerks. They justify it because they're afraid the yeerks will get their hands on it, but I don't see it happening. They'd had to have infiltrated the military pretty deeply to pull that off, at which point blowing up Serenity is lees important than starting a witchhunt and securing the President. That's leaving aside the fact that the military is probably working pretty hard right now to find and capture any potential spy. Given all that, I don't see any point in destroying Serenity (more on that later)

- I'm not sure what was the plan for subduing Esplin. Letting Jake stand there in the open, so that the Chee attack Esplin when he tries to capture him? That seems way too obvious to work.

- This scene was also super tense and super scary, by the way. You really get the sense that the kids are in over their heads way, way more than they've ever been.

- I like how Marco mentions "getting eaten by a fox" as a possible way the mission could go south. In canon, there were a few scenes where the kids were in the middle on the mission and then a natural predator (a spider when they were flies, a bird of prey, etc) just came and try to eat them out of nowhere. Being an animal's not so fun now, is it?

- "Muahahahahahah! Feel the might of my obscure-but-definitely-canon-(look-the-ghostwriter-period-was-weird-okay?) magic demorphing ray! /Next chapter: Rachel figures out how to make clones of herself by morphing into a starfish./

- I think everyone has already said all there is to say on the hypersight scene. It's trippy.

- I'm a bit confused: Esplin seems to be saying that he had a deal with the Chee, but they betrayed him somehow? It's not super clear.

- I wonder if Marco will survive this situation somehow? One possibility would be "it was only just a simulation" (Esplin kind of plays with the idea at the end, "if only you'd done things differently"), but it would obviously be very cheap. I say that because there's not much point in having Visser 1 be Marco's mom if Marco's not there to angst about it.

- On the other hand, if they're all really dead, it means all their protagonist-ness is now concentrated in Rachel, Garett and Ax! So they're basically invincible!

- And now we're pulling the trigger on Garett's Chekov's not-giving-the-cube-to-the-fundamentally-unreliable-robots.

*** One thing I kept noticing in this chapter is that Marco and the others are becoming a bit defeatist. They keep taking decisions that they know are suboptimal and rationalize them as "If X was going to go bad, we'd be screwed anyway anyway".

- Ax says you can't avoid playing into the Ellimist's hands.

- They trust the Chee because the Chee are really powerful and would be extremely hard to stop.

- Elfangor says "You can't guess the Ellimist's thoughts, and you shouldn't try".

- Marco decides that he was right not to bring a gun because he doesn't know how to use a gun / Esplin might have detected it.

It's pretty close to Tobias' "never in control" arc, where he went through the same "Just because I think it's hopeless doesn't mean I shouldn't do anything" questions, while also trying to let go when necessary and just let things play out. I think there's a remark in that chapter where he says they shouldn't just argue themselves into not doing anything.

On the other hand, I feel like they're fundamentally going at this the wrong way. Their reasoning is "There's no point in trying X, X wouldn't work because of Y anyway", but they don't really go the whole way and say "Therefore Y is a huge problem and we should wonder about how to fix it." They don't wonder about how to deal with the Ellimist's manipulations, Marco doesn't consider going to a gun range, they don't explore "Maybe we could hold a lot of dogs hostage?" solutions, etc. (I'm guessing they don't, because it seems pretty unlikely that they'd consider it all offscreen without at least some of it being mentioned)

This isn't a criticism of the story, mind you. This is definitely a real bias (premature tree-pruning? helplessness bias?) that I've seen myself and over people have, and it's pretty insidious.

--------------

I think the biggest mistake the protagonists make is that they act too much like protagonists. Marco's first thought when they learn Esplin's location is "shit, the military will know too"; they send David on missions instead of nameless soldiers; Marco complains about handing Thàn over to the government; they blow up Serenity; Tyagi decides not to send a recon mission to Vietnam, and the kids go anyway; etc.

Marco especially is doing the thing Jake complained about earlier, where he automatically assumes that if he's not the one to do the thing, someone else will screw it up.

I was especially surprised when they decided to attack Esplin by themselves. This is definitely something that should have been done through an airstrike, not in person. Yeah, ok, Esplin's ship probably has sufficiently advanced detectors, but they know that Elfangor's ship was able to scramble those detectors, and they could have sent a warhead inside an invisible Bug Fighter. Or something else; they should definitely have brainstormed tactics in that category with the military before going on a mission on their own.

(again, I'm not criticizing the story; the characters make mistakes, and part of the enjoyment is seeing them go "We've looked at this the wrong way, we need to do things this way instead")

--------------

All that being said, I did feel that the chapter was pretty unsatisfying overall :(

Obviously, it's pretty hard to have a chapter where the protagonists lose and not be disappointed. I think part of that is that the defeat feels a bit "unearned". All the individual elements (David's betrayal, the Chee, the demorph ray) were foreshadowed, but on the other hand... it feels like the Animorphs acted a little bit dumber than average and they wouldn't have been caught otherwise? Which is kind of a big no-no for killing off several protagonists.

I dunno. Jake's first death and Cassie's death felt earned, in a way. Not just because they were being reckless, but because it made sense that they were being reckless. Jake because he had this "I don't care about danger, I'm a hero" attitude, Cassie because she wanted to do good. On the other hand, in this chapter, it feels like most of their problems would have been avoided if they'd just said "You know what, David is more trouble than he's worth. Let's just turn him over and recruit someone else".

The other thing that doesn't help is... I feel like we don't have enough info to know what the characters "should" have done. It's like, in a RPG, you don't want your party to fail because a scenario was winnable, you want them to fail because you didn't see the secret exit or something. So far we don't really get that; there's no "If only we'd done X instead" (okay, Marco kind of has a moment like that when he almost bails at the last moment).

Part of that is that both we and the characters are missing some crucial information, that they aren't really trying to collect. What are Telor's intentions? What is the US doing / planning to do? What do the Chee want? The protagonists are kind of cutting themselves off from anyone else and going in blind, which means we don't really know what was the "right" thing to do; except that's not really a dramatic error, because we don't see them turn down an occasion to learn more about what's happening, or have a dramatic "If only we'd taken more time to talk things out with our allies" monologue.

So, there you have it. Not a bad chapter, very long and exciting, there's no specific bad scene, but what happens is kind of disappointing.

They've lost half the core team + Erek (including Jake and Marco's tactical insights), eliminated whatever advantage Serenity could give them, given Visser Three some Chee bodies to reverse engineer (note that Chee tech was one of the few things keeping the heroes a step ahead), and given up all sorts of valuable intel, such as the details of the Tyagi situation, the chats with Telor, and the existence of Ax-Temrash. They've gained nothing but have added a David/Visser into their ranks to steal their secrets/kill them/other horrifying strategies I won't mention in case TK decides to steal them.

Possible bright points of optimism include:

1: David+Visserclone decide to go after Visser Three mk. 1 because no villain likes competition (unlikely but funny).

2: If the remaining Animorphs (read: Rachel) can get the drop on David and imprison him, they have access to all his memories, including any intel he got from Visser Three's part of the hypersight (side note: I understand WHY we didn't get much of this but it was still frustrating that, for example, what Visser Three was actually doing in 'Nam was not part of that information flow).

I mean, realistically, this would be the case ever since Tobias got the USA president involved and shot down the bug fighter in Washington DC.

Like, the Animorphs make a big deal of going themselves to attack Visser 3, and I kind of get why they do in character (because they see themselves as the protagonists, and there's a prophecy, etc)... but looking at it logically, they weren't that well equipped for the mission compared to either Telor or the combined might of the United States military.

And looking at it another level deeper... well, Telor knows Visser 3's whereabouts, they have a lot of weapons and very good reason to kill him. The fact that they haven't killed him yet means there is some sort of obstacle that the Animorphs weren't aware of. So either the mission was doomed to fail, or it would have succeeded and Esplin's deadman switches would have killed everyone in the mothership and on the planet in horrible horrible plagues.

1. The idea was difficult to follow. I get that you're trying to model what it would feel like to have a conversation in Leeran hypersight, but we need to acknowledge that imagining that is difficult.

2. I had a bias against the protagonists losing this badly: I wanted them to win and plot armor in other fiction has conditioned me to expect them to win, and they did not seem to be winning, so I errantly tried to settle on interpretations where they weren't actually losing.

3. The presentation was difficult to follow. I know it's bad writing to put 'Visser Three thought-spoke', 'Marco thought', 'Marco imagined that David had previously thought' etc, at the start of every paragraph, but it would be useful when readers can so easily get lost.

** The Visser /asserts/ it to be the case that morphing gives the Ellimist the ability to manipulate memories, but he doesn't present adequate reasons for believing it, just a correlation between edited memory and wearing a morph in like 3 cases. I think he jumped to conclusions. If the Ellimist can reach out into Z-space and mess with brains, doing it in 3D-space should be just as trivial. A restriction to Z-space manipulation would make some sense as the result of a bargain between the Ellimist and Crayak, but it's hard to see why such a bargain would have come about, or how anyone could have deduced its existence just on the knowledge available to the Visser.

The inability of the Chee to understand Rachel remains as-yet unexplained. It seems like the Chee must be alive and participating in the hypersight, because "they would know that it was true, for it already was true", but there was no description of the Chee realizing that they couldn't detect Rachel's violence. This implies that their selective blindness is so absolute that they can't even notice it when experiencing mind-independent hypersight. Weird.

Like, even given that morphing is based on a magic supercomputer that Seerow somehow stumbled upon without anyone else realizing it (... which... look, I'm really not a fan of this whole concept). There would be no reason then to assume that morphed characters are more "accessible" to the gods. The super-emulator could be a part of the gods "fair play" engine, which was stated to be more powerful than either of them; it could forbid them to access its internal memory (which begs the question of why exactly the Escafil device can access it in the first place).

Honestly, I mostly preferred that the rules be vague and unexplained. Like, the gods are allowed to do subtle things, be manipulative, but not, like, decide "Fuck it, an asteroid falls on you and you die", which let most of the agency to the protagonist. I guess there's a pressure in a rational fic to explain it, to go "Here is what the gods can do and why", but then I start wondering "Why are these rules in place?

**** Maybe. I think Z-space is just as real as 3D-space, though. It's how spaceships move, and everything's just physics anyway. The restriction could be artificial, but it's a weird one.

***** Right, but most people outside of morph don't have their brains sticking out into Z-Space, whereas when in morph they apparently have their minds stashed in a Z-Spacial godcomputer

** "To remember what had happened the last time we had encountered the inscrutable, alien god... and all of Ventura had burned."

Yeah, seems like that was just yesterday.

Really great writing, as always. I know these threads tend to focus on the plot and worldbuilding, but I thought that conversation between Marco and David was one of the most compelling passages in the series. Personally, I didn't find the ending confusing, but I guessed after the last Esplin chapter that you meant to merge him and the One into the same character, so I was sort of expecting something like this. (Although I didn't see it coming the way you did it. Damn.)

** The Visser is entirely terrifying. Far more so than in the originals. Helps that [[/u/TK17Studios]]' writing is fantastic at drawing fears out.

I was wondering what was going on with David. The ebay listing is a nice callback to the originals. I could also tell [[#s][]]

** #+begin_quote
  The creature named David screamed, and the creature named Marco screamed with it, and the creatures named Tobias and Jake screamed also, and the creature named the Visser laughed as he drew them close, drew them close until they lay within his shadow, a shadow that stretched out, limitless, across the cosmos.

V3 has also more or less solved the cloning problem. His clones probably aren't going to be happy with being destroyed, so he has to reincorporate them into himself somehow. The bit I quoted sounds a lot like he can assimilate other intelligences as well.

Of course, I don't see how this would benefit him, and any use of it to keep our heroes alive would be pretty deus ex machinaey....

Edit: Actually, maybe this would accord with his goals. He wants to conquer death, he's already used to dominating a shared mind and experimenting along those lines, /if/ he could do it without risk he'd probably prefer to assimilate rather than kill. Hard to work out what this would actually entail though.

Otherwise why would he choose David as his assassin? He knows the others are more likely to be trusted...Oh wait, is David the only one without earplugs?

*** Yes, it wasn't directly addressed in the chapter and maybe should be, but David is the only one without earplugs and thus the only viable Controller/assassin.

**** Shoot, my default reaction is to start nitpicking, I need to remember that /you/ don't know just how much I'm enjoying this. Literally getting chills and occasionally muttering obscenities at my computer screen, etc. Very much enjoying, but find it hard to engage in any useful high level criticism, so I quibble with details.

Without detracting from how much I'm loving this, I guess editors are actually domain experts and do have value. There are a lot of times that I've been confused, and had to reread and really think about something, if not go to the comments on the Reddit thread, and I have a memory of reading some professional author talk about how you had to have half a dozen reminders that your character had a sprained ankle before you were allowed to make it plot-relevant, cuz if you mentioned it once the reader would forget 100 pages later.

Of course, not everything is meant to be easy to read, and I suspect I'll get a hell of a lot out of rereading this in one go once you finish it.

** So, what is meant to be happening on the Visser's visits to earth?

Is he doing logistics for his extensions that he has embedded in/ spying on Telor?

Is he planting some sort of plague dispensers on a deadman switch or similar? I don't think so, or the Chee would have seen it.
