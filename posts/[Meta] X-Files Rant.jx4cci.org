X-FILES SPOILERS BELOW

So I've been watching [[https://sfdebris.com/videos/xfiles/xfiles1e01.php][SF's Debris X-Files Reviews]] because I don't want to study for my law finals and I hate myself. For those who don't know, the premise of the conspiracy theorist protagonist is that his younger sister was abducted by aliens.

We later find our there's a pan-government conspiracy (well a ton of them actually, but that's not the point) that's cooperating with the aliens to help them colonize the Earth with some kind of human-alien hybrids. That doesn't matter either.

What matters is that there are aliens on Earth who can genetically engineer themselves to become invisible, shapeshift into humans, and *COME TO EARTH* which makes the first two completely irrelevant. They put it as some kind of evil conspiracy that's making the government cooperate with aliens, and that's whats driving me crazy. I would love a scene where Mulder, the conspiracy theorist protagonist and FBI agent (because standards have dropped) gets pulled into a room by his boss, the door shut, and told flat out they're doing everything they can to ensure the survival of humanity in face of the alien threat. Why are they working with the aliens then? Because the only alternative to cooperating fully with the hybrid plan is the Earth being bombarded from orbit by fucking FTL weapons and made uninhabitable to us. Hell, they don't even need to have to have FTL weapons, they could just park their *interstellar spaceships* somewhere between Earth and Mars, and fire asteroids at us until we're all dead. What the fuck does he expect the government to do??? The ISS isn't exactly geared for shooting down incoming /human/ missiles directed at the entire earth's surface, let alone whatever super tech the aliens have. Does he expect it to go like Independence Day and we can movie-hack all their ships into crashing? Does he think we have nukes that can hit spaceships that can travel light years?? Even if the spaceships are generation ships, the sheer amount of technology required to spend decades if not centuries in space means we have absolutely no chance. He's emblematic of conspiracy theorists not thinking these things through and it's driving me crazy!

-End rant.


** That's the kind of problem with "UFOs visiting us" in general.

I had a [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24754333][bit of a rant]] about that a month ago on Hacker News. A lot of people still "want to believe" that secret alien visitations are possible, apparently.

Any kind of interstellar travel technology (fictional FTL or not) also implies a level of technology that obviates the need to be subtle about an alien invasion. If we're on the non-fictional physics area of possible scenarios, a small self-replicating probe still implies a tech level that would brush aside any resistance our current human civilization could put up. If the aliens are capable of bringing over more mass to our solar system (via fictional FTL or whatever), then the situation tilts further to their favor.

*Edit*: grammar.

*** Maybe the scariest plotline in the '90s space combat game /Star Control II/ is the one you pick up as soon as you leave the Sol system and encounter a Slylandro Probe.

The Slylandro are balloon creatures that live in a gas giant. They can't leave their planet since pressure differences would kill them. When they were visited by interstellar traders, they bought a self-replicating, automated, interstellar probe ship; which they sent out to discover other life in the galaxy. The probes malfunctioned; now they attack any sentient life they encounter, eat the debris, and produce more probes ... while periodically emitting, "We come in peace."

** The "Three body problem" book has kind of the same problem. It gets recommended quite often (including here) and it's one of those things where I do not understand how it can be popular.

X-Files, I can understand, however. I have never seen it, but I guess they wanted a police procedural with a twist and reverse engineered the world building from there? I've learned to never watch those even if the permise seems interesting (such as e.g. "Almost human").

I remember right all they did was send a generation ship which we could do anyway and by the time it arrived humanity had advanced beyond them which is perfectly reasonable if you assume a rate of technological development like OTL.

If they sent the spaceship in their tech level of 2050 when we were 2000 (so they are 50 years ahead of us) by the time it got here we'd be at 2200 even with their sabotage.

I'm not sure I remember right but wasn't there also cultural reasons?

I DNFed half-way through the first book. So maybe it gets better. My main problem is that it is hard-sf in the sense that it does not have engaging characters/character arcs ("space opera"). If those were good I probably wouldn't look so much for plot holes...

As for the plot holes (only w.r.t. topic):

- The aliens are able to send a super-computer that can somehow project a virtual reality game/hallucinations into peoples brains. Those are already there.
- The aliens/super-computers are (already) able to disrupt physics experiments (which makes scientists kill themselves because they get random results ?!?).
- As OP mentioned a generation ship is a already huge accomplishment, not to mention surviving the extreme system (but in reality Alpha Centauri is just a binary predicatable star system so even the title is a plot hole)

***** Well if you don't like it you don't like it but it's one of my favourite sci-fi series ever, the second (third?) book especially is one of the best presentations of the fermi paradox and the filters I've ever read. Up there with Culture series.

And I love finding plot holes/contrivances as much as the next rational subscriber, but... you're complaining on one hand about the premises and on the other about motivations that are explained later.

"As OP mentioned a generation ship is a already huge accomplishment, not to mention surviving the extreme system (but in reality Alpha Centauri is just a binary predicatable star system so even the title is a plot hole)"\\
Yes, in our universe Centauri is a binary system but the whole premise of the book is about a trisolar system. Like, if that's a complaint, it's not like you think Liu Cixin didn't know that. There's obviously not going to be any example of this math problem nearby, and to make it far away would certainly undermine the development. Why don't you complain about how unlikely it is for a civilization to develop on the very next system and also be at an almost identical (geologically speaking) age?

I thought it was covered in the first book but maybe the cultural stuff was in the second, but you got mad that the aliens didn't do what you expected to and you never even read the cultural and evolutionary justification for their actions. You're right that the Sophons could obviously have done more after all they destroy the entire human fleet in 2 seconds that humans spent 2 centuries building but I don't recall feeling the explanation to be at all lacking. You gave up and you never read about their reasons?

****** Personally speaking I hated the first book and slogged through it in case it addressed some issues, which it almost did.

My issue was that it /completely/ misunderstood the three body problem. Like yes, it's unsolvable, but it can be approximated! You can project the next couple of years! That's all they needed!

This completely ignores the fact that the system as described is physically impossible. Sure, you can arrange a system with those problems, but it's either going to need a period or you're going to crash into the sun or get ejected. Those are your three options. You're not going to get anything else on a geological timescale.

I would be mildly less critical of the story if it didn't make the main character A FUCKING MATHEMATICIAN. Even if he was completely unaware of the three body problem beforehand a simple wikipedia page would have been enough to get him up to speed on how tractable the problem is.

Honestly I kinda get how it got so popular, it's got a great story with real emotional weight and creativity behind it, and it's even smart enough to address some of the issues in it's premise! But the central question of the first book is a mathematical non-issue, and so much fucking narrative weight is placed on a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means in a way that the supposedly intelligent main character should see right through.

******* Yes, maybe that's the problem. I took courses on how to approximately solve differential equations in university. So I immediately jumped to "it's differential equations without closed form solution (that's what it means with unsolvable, right?). But they can approximate it starting off with Euler's method... once they have computers and good starting boundaries they can probably predict centuries in the future and modify the system using gravity assist etc. to improve livability."

A good writer trick would be to sprinkle in some magic (e.g. quantum fluctuations), but it didn't. That said, all that would be forgivable had it good writing and/or characters. As is, it throws a cool concepts at you which turn out to be hollow once you think about them a bit. And once the cool concepts are hollow, I had nothing left to justify continuing to read it.

The non-developed characters are sometimes justified as "Big problems are solved at the society level. This is how Chinese solve big problems and tell stories (more relevant with COVID-19 now, I guess?). Recommended for the new cultural experience". Except, they took his other story (Wandering earth) and added in unnecessary viewpoint characters when they translated it for the general audience for the big screen.

That's addressed in-story, though, isn't it? "For the next couple thousand years" isn't good enough for the Trisolarians who can live much longer, and they know they'll /eventually/ need a new planet, and now they've found one where the inhabitants are not yet advanced enough. I'm not a mathematician, but the copious footnotes convinced me that the author had done his due diligence in researching the mathematical state of the art.

  So there's several issues here. First of all, "solving" the three body problem isn't useful for a chaotic system, which is what's described. Second of all, a chaotic orbit ends in a sun, no questions asked, because the position of their planet is essentially random and in only a few orbits it'll either be ejected at escape velocity or it'll crash. Even with the massive three body system of the sun, Jupiter and Saturn there's nothing (big) playing solar system tourist between them, everything''s settled into nice stable resonant orbits. But whatever, the aliens live in a harsh environment and they're too fascist to transition to a nicer place and solve their problems. My issue is that the main character is supposedly super smart and not in a cult, but when told about the three body problem he's completely unaware of how pointless trying to solve it is because of the problems fundamental properties. Chaotic systems can't be solved and it's incredibly easy to solve the problem well enough. The cult is pointless and the aliens can't be reasoned with. As soon as "three body problem" was said and he checked Wikipedia half the book of him being stupid and confused could have been cut out, and we could focus on the authors strong points of prose, narrative, character, commentary, and emotion. ! <

******* Well I can't disagree with that. I'm not educated in mathematics so I'd never heard of the three body problem. But still I didn't think it was likely that the planet would get so close so that it would get burned up yet remain in orbit repeatedly with time for evolution.

But again, that's the premise so...

TLDR, do not confuse /expected number of civilisations/ with /probability of nonzero civilisations/ - due to the fairly flat and right-tailed distribution they're very different, and there's actually a pretty good chance that we really are alone.

** The X-files have a special place in my heart. I sneaked up in the late evening to watch a very few episodes as a kid, but more often I had to lie in bed and just listen to the famous intro music because my parents were watching and didn't let me join. I /really/ liked and still like the early stuff. Vague, mysterious conspiracies and Mulder trying desperately to unearth the truth.

The problem is, that's kinda what the writers were going for. It's not like Breaking Bad, built with clear arcs in mind. The X-files were written a few episodes or at most a season at a time. They had no end game in mind, just added to the lore a little here and a little there. Sometimes different writers wrote things that didn't quite fit together into one coherent plot. That's why toward the end, when they are trying to wrap things up, the different plot lines don't quite line up and you get baddies that seem to have been working against their own stated interests, especially with the different alien factions.

Now. All that said. If you watch the final episode, you will have INCONTROVERTIBLE proof that cancer man is Gandalf. So let that one simmer for a moment. We were actually in Middle Earth all along.

Except for /Babylon 5/, pretty much all TV series were this way at the time. The story-arc thing didn't catch on until later; after DVRs, streaming, and piracy made it possible for viewers to catch up on plotlines after missing an episode or two. In the TV/VCR era, the only way to catch up on missed episodes (unless & until they came out in reruns or on tape) was if you or a friend had taped them.

**** I used to hate this /so much/ when I was younger, and it was one of the big reasons I preferred anime over American TV. But now that I am older and know more about the constraints TV writers operate under, I understand why they did it that way and realize that there are some advantages to episodic storytelling over serialized story arcs.

One is that, as you said, it wasn't possible to catch up on missing episodes until re-runs circled back around to the same spot. Streaming didn't exist, neither did DVD season sets, and VHS was highly impractical for TV shows as opposed to movies (a 1-hour drama could fit 2 episodes per tape, so you would need a bookshelf to hold something like the complete /Star Trek: The Next Generation/, which [[https://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Trek-Next-Generation-VHS-Bundle-Complete-Set-89-Cassettes-/224217650673][weighted in at *89* tapes]], not to mention how expensive all those tapes would be). The way anime dealt with this (tons of flashbacks and the occasional recap episode) left much to be desired.

But there were other reasons, too. A big one is that American TV writers, as a rule, never knew if they are going to get another season or not. /Babylon 5/ fell prey to this; the original plan called for five seasons, then it looked like the fourth season would be their last so they had to cram two seasons' worth of content into one, and /then/ it turned out that they would get a fifth season after all and they had to make something up even though they had already finished the story. This made long-term planning difficult, to say the least. Not to mention wasteful... why bother writing out plans for a season that might never exist? So TV writers' incentive is to pour all their effort into the current season and to worry about the next season only if and when it is confirmed they will get one. This led to shows like /The X-Files/ and /Lost/ where the writers were just making shit up as they went along with no grand plan, which in turn made an unsatisfying conclusion all but guaranteed.

And speaking of unsatisfying conclusions, one of the big advantages of episodic storytelling is that a bad ending doesn't mar the rest of the series the way it does with serialized storytelling. Think about /Game of Thrones/, which is legendary for how horrible its final season was. There is no way to start watching /Game of Thrones/ from the beginning and have it end in anything but disaster; either you stop halfway through and get an incomplete story, or you keep going and get to see the greatest show in TV history go down in flames. By contrast, consider /Star Trek: The Original Series/. The third season, derisively known as the "turd season" by fans, is widely considered to be inferior to the other two. But that's OK! You can just pretend that the third season never happened. There are no cliffhangers or unresolved character arcs. It even works on a smaller scale; in an episodic series, you can just ignore any bad episodes, /period/, and it doesn't affect the overall story, because there /is/ no overall story! That's a pretty big advantage.

But, on the other hand, I feel like some of this could have been avoided if American TV makers could just understand the concept of ending a show /before/ it goes downhill. Both [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime][the Japanese]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity][the British]] had no trouble with this notion. Americans, by contrast, had a model where a TV show should be squeezed for as long as possible, getting renewed for endless seasons until it inevitably jumped the shark and only cancelling it when the ratings got low enough. An American TV show was considered successful in direct proportion to how many seasons it lasted before the executives pulled the plug. That's... not a good way to make art.

** I guess a counterpoint to your criticism is that we don't know what Alien laws and regulations look like (and cultural hangups/taboos and religious obligations, the idea of any society with FTL also being completely united may end up being too idealistic). The aliens involved in the conspiracy could be the equivalent of an Alien-CIA that has to retain some degree of plausible deniability and "hands-off" actions in order to avoid punishment from whatever government is above them. I don't know how that'd mesh up with specific actions in the show, but if I had to do a ratfic of X-files that's the approach I'd take (also because I'm down for taking a shot at the history of the CIA fucking with the politics of foreign nations by having an Alien-CIA doing the same to America).

(Disclaimer, my X-files knowledge comes from several years back when I was multitasking between playing Hearthstone and watching about half the seasons of the show simultaneously so it's pretty mish-mash and outdated. Also kinda on-topic to say I ended up enjoying the show because I was using literally only half my attention lol)

** Animorphs has a good solution to this:

1. The invaders are parasites who want physical intact and well-developed human bodies, so a silent invasion is more useful.

2. Spaceships are not that large, and propelling even a single asteroid would take a long-term coordinated effort. A species with hundreds of ships manages to nudge an asteroid's path only once in the series, wiping out the dinosaurs

3. The invaders stole from and were given their technology by the heroic aliens, so their technology outside of FTL is not far beyond human tech.

4. Humans have a higher population than the invaders or any other species by thousands. Between that and #3, an open invasion could well fail. In an alternate timeline it probably does fail.

5. Because of the invaders' internal politics, the silent invasion is considered more successful, and the leader pushing for open war is disregarded, until he uses a show trial to charge the pro-silent invasion leader with treason and have her executed.

Maybe they DO have time-travel atop everything else, and hence why their plan looks so self-contradictory and convoluted. Maybe its the only way they will be are have had conquered the Earth without killing their own Grandfathers in the process.

** There's always a lot assumptions about the culture of aliens in these kinds of posts. Why are we assuming literally anything about their culture? We can't make any assumptions about their goals or methodological biases/preferences. Perhaps their goal with abductions of other beings is to test new genetic modifications that will permit them to adjust their own species less dangerously. Perhaps there are only dozens of them alive after a catastrophe and they need to figure out how to breed with other species. Perhaps they want to use the genetic sequencing of human subjects to run through a machine to produce a unique scent or light show for their entertainment. Perhaps they have a taboo against direct, provable violence but idealize subtle intrigues. Perhaps they want to create a sustainable human centipede. Perhaps they are a hive mind and don't understand the idea of a drone having individual value, dismissing their abductions as mere rudeness. Perhaps they televise the galaxy games, where abductees from across the galaxy are forced to compete for their amusement. Perhaps they believe their perceptions are a simulation, and don't take things seriously because they don't matter. Perhaps there are vast interstellar empires, and their activities have to be kept secret to avoid reprisals from other species.

Any one of these options explains their behavior to some extent. You're making the large assumption that they are conquerors when their activities are contrary to that assumption.
