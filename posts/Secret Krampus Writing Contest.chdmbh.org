It's the summer writing contest you've all been unknowingly waiting for!

It's like a Secret Santa writing contest, except that it takes place in the summer, hence being named after the complete opposite of Santa Claus, Krampus.

The idea is that everyone who enters comes up with a story prompt, the prompts are randomly passed to someone else who also entered, and every participant writes a story based on their given prompt.

After the submission deadline has passed, all prompts and stories will be published in two different threads and everyone will vote for their favorite prompt and their favorite story.

Was there a prompt that you wished was used for the Biweekly Challenge? Now's your chance to get someone to write something based on your idea!

Rules:

- The submitted story must be at least 500 word minimum, no maximum.
- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.
- Winner gets reddit gold, and bragging rights.
- Prompt and story submissions must be sent as a PM to me ([[/u/xamueljones][u/xamueljones]]).
- Submitted replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else. This makes it easier for me since when it's time to vote, I can simply post it as a comment link. Otherwise I have to copy and paste the text into a very long comment. Save us both some grief and submit your story as a link in a PM to me.
- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided. (This mostly applies to calling for outside parties to vote.)
- In the interest of fairness, only participants who actually submitted a story will be included in the voting thread for the best prompts.

If you want to enter the contest, PM me with your username and a prompt before the entry deadline of Friday, August 2nd.

Put some thought into your prompt and try to make it interesting. Here's some good [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts][advice]] for writing a compelling prompt.

I reserve final say on whether or not a given prompt is acceptable. This is mostly to weed out any low-effort prompts, or prompts with unsuitable themes such as sexual content or harmful themes.

Once August 2nd, 11:59 pm (EST) has passed, the entry deadline will close and in a few hours, every participant will be PMed a prompt (but not the username of the individual who submitted it).

It is suggested that participants keep to themselves whether or not they entered, or the prompts they submitted. This is to avoid influencing whoever receives their story prompt, but nothing will be done to enforce this rule.

Every participant will have until Friday, August 30th, or four weeks to submit their stories in a PM to me.

Once August 30th, 11:59 pm (EST) has passed, the submission deadline will close and in a few hours, two threads will go up each with a list of the prompts or a list of the stories submitted.

There will be two weeks to vote on the favorites with a deadline of September 13th.

Once September 13th, 11:59 pm (EST) has passed, the two winners will be announced and receive their prizes.

Who wants to enter the contest and prove themselves the most evil Krampus!?!

EDIT: I just realized that people might be reluctant to enter a contest without knowing how many participants there are, so I'll be keeping a running tally here for anyone who wants to know.

Current number of secret Krampuses: *26*

** My biggest worry is getting a prompt like "write a FANDOM fanfiction where [CHANGE TO CHARACTER/PREMISE]" and not being familiar with FANDOM and then having to learn about it enough to write a compelling story.

Are all the prompts meant to be fandom-neutral?

If no, is there a way to reject your prompt if you're unfamiliar with the subject matter?

(I'd probably struggle with a premise of "Alternate history of the USA where [historical event] was different" as a non-american for similar reasons).

*** That's among some of the issues I'm screening prompts for. Prompts need to be vague to allow for writers to use their creativity to take it in any direction they want. By writing a specific fandom, it's more of a commission for a specific story rather than helping to inspire someone. If a prompt is too specific, I usually give feedback or point out the issue to help participants to improve it for the contest. I'll try to help anyone to keep from being too specific about things like geography or culture that not everyone would know about, but it hasn't been an issue yet.

If people really have an issue with their prompts, I can allow them to switch their prompts with someone else. If there's only one person who has an issue with their prompt, then I can give my prompt to them and write about theirs.

**** Maybe I misunderstand prompts, but I always thought they were guidelines, not rules? As in, you're free to ignore parts of the prompt anyway. The prompt is meant as inspiration not a constraint.

So if the prompt is set in some world, you're still free to write a story not set in that world.

Did I interpret that incorrectly?

***** That's definitely how I'd handle such a prompt if I got it:

"Write an alternate history where the Federalist Papers were never published."

All I know about the Federalist Papers is what I learned in listening to the Hamilton soundtrack, and googling it it looks like it had something to do with the constitution.

SO, gun to my head, writing this story?

It's a story about how America would be if it stayed a British colony forever. Present Day: America is voting whether or not to become a republic (Australia had one about 20 years ago that failed), probably do something from a campaign room and talk about racism and how it's different in alternate America than current America. Drop lots of references to people drinking tea and of course British style slang.

... you know what I would be OK with this, but I think the author of the prompt might be a little disappointed. But tough titties for them for making a terrible prompt.

For [[/r/AlternativeHistory]] that's a fantastic prompt. For a generalized writing contest on [[/r/rational]], not so much.

***** I basically agree with what [[/u/MagicWeasel][u/MagicWeasel]] just said and have no intention to police people for going 'against' the prompt. What someone chooses to write based on the prompt is up to them.

However, I am willing to give leeway to someone who honestly feels like they are struggling with a given prompt and will work something out if it comes up.

I agree with the rule for the prompt, since you don't know who's going to get your prompt and what they are comfortable writing about, but I hope there's no such rule for the actual story? Lots of great stories deal with sex or difficult themes.

*** Yeah, no matter what someone writes, if it's submitted before the deadline, the story will be accepted. I won't be rejecting any stories. Just the prompts due to the obvious issue of not knowing if someone receives something that they cannot write about.

Writers can choose to write about sex or difficult themes if they want to, but it needs to be something that they choose to do of their own volition rather than being required to do so by a given prompt.

** What level of detail should we aim for/expect for prompts? Should they be one word prompts like the biweekly challenge or more detailed single/multi sentence descriptions?

Also, this is an awesome idea.

*** Thank you!

The prompts can vary a lot and I don't want to restrict the possibilities too much, but I'm mostly focusing on making sure that the prompts are flexible in that people can spin several different story ideas out of it instead of sounding like a commission for a specific story idea. I tried to not come off as pushy, but everyone's been appreciative of me giving feedback on their prompts when they submitted them.

The lengths have varied quite a bit, but most of them are a single sentence with several people submitting a full paragraph.

If you want, you could go with just a single word like the Biweekly Challenge, but I'd like it if people showed creativity by coming up with an interesting sentence to daydream about.
