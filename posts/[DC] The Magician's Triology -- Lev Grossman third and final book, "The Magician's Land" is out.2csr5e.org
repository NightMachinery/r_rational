The Magician's trilogy is one of the best Deconstructive Fantasy series that I've ever encountered. Before now, the third book is the only trilogy-finishing volume that I've been watching for beside The Kingkiller Chronicles book three.

I only just found out about the third book, and I'm gonna reread the first two amazing volumes before finishing the trilogy, so please tag spoilers with the right volume number.

The first two books set up almost as many questions as the first two of the kingkiller series, and I can't wait to return to the beautifully built world, bleak and dark, but also magnificent and inspiring.

It kind of reminds me of the emotional response to the Dark Souls world.


** My copy of the third book just came in the mail yesterday, and I heartily second the recommendation with a single caveat - the main character does not start out terribly likable. I personally had no problem with it, since it reminded me a lot of how I was as a nerdy intellectual teenager, but it's the single thing that's most likely to reduce your enjoyment of the book if that kind of thing bothers you. On more positive notes, these books are one of the few in my long career as a fantasy reader to actually make magic feel /magical/. I love "magic as engineering", but /The Magicians/ at several points made me go "Holy crap, they're doing magic!"

*** /The Magicians/ came out just as I was entering high school, prime time for the unlikeable nerdy intellectual teenager, and I just ate it up. It captured something remarkably human; that even with wonder and adventure and opportunity, people are still themselves, and a situation cannot make you happy forever if you're not that kind of person. Plus, the multiversebuilding was great, and I would like to learn more about the makers and magic.

I'm saving up for the third book, and hope to be able to read it soon (not like the library's going to get it!).

*** I agree with everything you wrote here. Haven't got the third book yet, will go get it soon.

Coldwater is largely the author of his own misfortunes throughout, especially in the first book.

*** The third book was fantastic, by the way. It did everything that I could possibly want a concluding book of the trilogy to do.
