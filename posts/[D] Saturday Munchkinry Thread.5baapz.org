Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Society-level munchkinry*

Everyone in the world is telekinetic, able to exert force at a distance of up to two meters. Telekinetic power comes at different levels, each five times as powerful as the last. A T-2 can exert 1 N of force (enough to press a key on a keyboard), while a T-7 can exert 3125 N of force (as powerful as a kickboxer's punch), and a T-12 can exert 9.7 x 10^{6} N, which is about the thrust of a Space Shuttle booster rocket at launch. This power is continuous and unlimited so long as the individual wants to use it, and can be turned on and off at will.

Power level is based on how many generations an individual can go back before they have a repeated ancestor. If your parents were half-siblings, then you would be able to go back two generations (and be a T-2) because your grandmother or grandfather would appear on the family tree twice. If your parents were first cousins, you could go back three generations, making you a T-3. If your parents were fifth cousins, you could go back seven generations, making you a T-7. (In the case of generational mismatch, as if your parents were first cousins once removed, you would take the higher of distance to consanguinity.)

You're the king of a kingdom with a million people. You want to maximize the telekinetic powers of your kingdom, not just within the next twenty years that you expect to rule, but for the foreseeable future, centuries down the line. *How do you maximize telekinetic powers?* What laws do you institute, how do you attempt to change your culture, and what institutions do you found?

*** - Keep very good track of genealogy, so that power levels can be predicted before children are even born. Test all power levels, though, in case of infidelity or other genealogical error. Go into full panic alert mode if any genealogical error springs up and try to figure out what caused it. This will require strongly socially conservative values on sexuality - strong social sanctions against infidelity and so on.
- As is normal in ancient human societies with a focus on breeding high-quality offspring: institute polygamy wherein high-status men have multiple wives and low-status men are used as disposable cannon fodder. Status in men and women is dependent on power level.
- Criminalize the marriage of men to women of a higher power level/status. Criminalize the marriage of men to women who will produce children with a lower power level/status than the woman. If these two laws are obeyed, all children will have power levels one higher than their mother. Strongly socially encourage men to marry at least one woman with their same power level, thereby producing children with a power level greater even than themselves - for example, give these stronger children a significantly larger share of the inheritance wherever they exist.
- Strongly socially encourage men to have very large numbers of children - not just in total, but with each of their wives. Conquer nearby nations for boosters of genetic material, but this may not even be needed if you set a strong social value on fertility and genealogy early on.

EDIT: I think it might be advantageous to make it fashionable to marry close relatives of close relatives' spouses. This creates stronger family bonds without increasing the amount of ancestral repetition.

*** Assume there are two individuals breeding, with power levels X and Y where X ≤ Y. Their most recent shared ancestor is R generations back.

If I understand the rules correctly, there are only two possible outcomes for the child's power, Z:

- R ≤ X → Z = R
- R > X → Z = X + 1

In other words, the power can grow by at most 1 over the weakest parent as their limiting ancestor will be only 1 generation more distant.

This means that, effectively, the only people that matter for your breeding potential are your N most recent generations of ancestry. If two breeding candidates share an ancestor N + 1 generations back, who cares? Still, in that N generations each parent has 2^{N-1} ancestors that could limit their offspring (so 2^{N} total unique individuals needed).

The most interesting implication here in a societal sense is that only people of equal power can create offspring more powerful than they. If Mum is T-8 and Dad is T-7, their children can be, at best, T-8 (i.e. the same as Mum).

This would seem to encourage a caste system for reproduction. Low power partners devalue offspring, so if you stigmatise them marrying "outside their kind" then their children will be more likely to be more powerful, which in turns increases the chances of replenishing the numbers in the upper levels (which take a really long time to refill if depopulated).

Since the biggest limiting factor to your nation's power is going to be the highest power individuals, you'd want to focus on making them. Indirect methods are going to run into a simple numbers problem; the aforementioned exponential ancestors requirement means that two random T-12s (or whatever high tier) are quite unlikely to be able to produce a T-13. Breeding programs to create needed diverse lines would be crucial (e.g. if person A has exactly half the kingdom's people, try to create person B with the other half).

With that in mind, I'd create a Ministry of Ancestry to provide free ancestry checking for all citizens and to offer money to citizens who wished to be assigned spouses to fill in the gaps (the money offered would be scale with their power somehow, as you'd want a pliable 9 more than a 3).

This seems very important and exploitable.

If you give up our current social values (which is practically a given), you can have a ~4:1 generational speed mismatch between genders.

If you have men bear children at age 60 and women at age 15, you could have 4 generations in 60 years with only 8 ancestors instead of 30 in that time. Growth of the breadth of your family tree would still be exponential compared to its height, but it would be ~x^{1.25} instead of ~x^{2} (I did some math wrong, as I can't figure out the exact ratio).

*** I expect there to be huge problems with childraising/teenagers/alcohol, depending on when T first starts and if society has means to disable it (drug, lobotomy etc). A T7 baby will already be bad news for the parents. A T12 /must/ be raised in isolation far away from towns, and even then has high likelyhood to kill itself/parents trough accident.

So we face a bottleneck of "how many strong Telepaths do survive until adolescence" - breeding for quiet babies and subvervient behaviour seem good choices. Also helps against random T12s or higher trying to ursurp the throne. Seems like the most obvious ruler pattern, the strongest Telepath on the throne.

So I'd want a tradition of drugs(inhibitory/sedatative) to deal with unruly Telepaths, in the form of research/chemistry/alchemists guild. It might be necessary to be able to sedate a raging todler at a moments notice, and a strong police/military/ninja/warrior-caste to deal with rampaging Telepaths.

Then a japanese-like culture of giving up individuality for the greater good of society, monastery-like culture of retreat, restraint, abstinence from alkohol etc.

Then we'd want to fund expeditions to far-off countries. Some whacko centuries old report tells of a land far to the east? Send the highspeed telepath-powered airship there to get breeders and their rare genes here, if necessary by force/slavery.

Or maybe nothing so dark, but I'd expect a strong tradition to seek/exchange mates from either very very far away, (like "they look visibly different than me") or from somewhere where they have good records.

Put extremely harsh punishments on altering/lying/falsifiying gen records.

** You have a box with a switch on top. An indicator light turns red if the switch is in one position, and blue if the switch is in the other position.

On the side of the box are several dials, a button, and an LED screen. The dials allow you to define an exact amount of time - anywhere from one second to one year - and the LED screen displays the /probability that the switch will be in the red position at that point in the future/. This is similar to Dinah's power in Worm, but with a very limited type of question you can ask and an unlimited number of uses available.

The device requires power to operate, and if the power is interrupted between now and the future, /that future will count as 0.5 red futures and 0.5 blue futures/. For example, if there are proportionally one futures where the device is switched to red, two futures where the device is switched to blue, and two futures where the device's power is interrupted, the device will read .4000, because the depowered futures are split between the red and blue futures. /Depowering the device adds noise to the signal and pushes the probabilities it gives closer to .5000./

So what do you do with it?

*** *Step one: Make money.* I break out my spreadsheet and divide the next week up into blocks of bits. I can define each number of the Minnesota Powerball with 7 bits, which means I can get the whole 6 number sequence with 42 bits. Powerball drawings happen every week; the next one is in four days, on November 9th.

I decide that 10:01am-10:05am on November 10th will be reserved for the first bit, then 10:06am-10:11am for the second bit, etc. Red for 0, blue for 1. All told it will take me about three and a half hours of switch flipping to enter the digits when the time comes. Obviously /tonight/ I use the machine to read the digits, and assuming that all probabilities are >90% I buy a ticket.

This /should/ allow me to go straight to my "what to do if I win the powerball" routine, which takes care of seed money. (I haven't done the research for it, but if necessary I go to a state where I can redeem the lottery money anonymously, or at least in a way that's not going to be public information.)

*Step two: Automate and secure the machine.* I get a little robot arm to toggle the switch for me based on a text file that I feed it. That takes care of inputting information to my past self. Outputting information to my present self is a little more complicated, but probably still doable; I just need a camera set up to read the screen and a robot hand to turn the dial (this is assuming that I don't want to take apart the machine at all). Anything to avoid manually reading in and deciphering the binary.

Before any of that, I use my seed money to move the machine to a secure location and get it hooked up to multiple redundant power sources. This should be the only time the machine ever loses power. I'm on the fence about hiring armed guards; ideally I just leave the machine running and transmitting encrypted data back to me and not attract attention to myself.

*Step three: Probe the future.* I need to know how divergent possible futures are. To that end, I guess I dial in times and see how high probabilities are; do they eventually merge towards 50% as uncertainty washes out certainty? If so, how quickly? After I've determined how "stable" the future is, I try to take some direct readings. SMS is 160 7-bit characters, which my automated system can (hopefully) read in and out in a few hours time assuming my chosen time fidelity is 1 minute blocks (probably overcautious). I precommit to sending the same SMS to myself iff I strongly believe that it applies; this allows me to feed myself arbitrary messages.

*Step four: Research/steal.* Depending on how muddy the future gets and how quickly, I can set up self-reinforcing loops that almost always give me the same information. I can devote blocks of time to sending research papers back to myself, allowing me to invest in science in one future and then just harvest the data in the other futures. I can also /probably/ break encryption and/or passwords with a "send password back if it worked, else randomize bits sent" commitment scheme, which should result in me in the present getting more information from futures that got sent the password, depending on how exactly that works.

Are you sure this doesn't instead pump probability to scenarios where I never try that experiment? That'd give me a reset button if I ever find myself in a timeline that I feel went wrong - though it'd be a bummer if the timeline I pump to starts at the big bang again and this machine is the Great Filter.

*** "Let's play a game," he said.

"Spare me the SAW bullshit." His girlfriend rolled her eyes.

"Naw, c'mon. It'll be fun."

Tess frowned, then shrugged. "Sure, why not."

She put down her novel. "So, what are we going to play, chess? Uno."

"Nah, I got something new from one of my friends. You know the one." Saying this, Bob set a small cardboard box down onto the table.

It was unadorned, except for the shipping information.

"Some sort of prototype?" Tess asked.

"Yep, he asked me to test it."

"Huh. Alright, I'm sort of interested now. What are the rules?"

"Hold on a sec."

The tape on the box refused to be ripped off, so he pulled out his pocket knife and cut through it. Opening the box, he pulled out it's contents.

There were three wooden blocks and a glossy sheet of paper. The wooden blocks had rounded edges and laser-cut engravings on each side, but otherwise were rather crude. One block had ones engraved into in each corner, another had twos, and the third had threes.

Bob skimmed over it quickly, while Tess weighed a wooden block in one hand, bobbing it up and down.

"The rules look pretty simple. One person rolls these blocks like dice while the other looks away, and then they'll make a sentence. The first block starts an analogy, the second block is the subject, and the third block is what they're compared to. Then the roller has to read out the sentence they make, and the other person has to not laugh. I guess it's some test of comedic delivery, or something."

"Really? That's it? Usually the stuff he makes is better than this."

Bob matched Tess's frown. "Yeah, to be honest, I'm not impressed."

"By the way, these blocks feel kind of weird; like there's metal inside of them or something."

"Wait, really? Maybe there's some secret to them."

Tess blinked. "Do you think so?"

"I don't know. But I don't think he'd ship something from New York to California if he didn't have a reason. I guess they're worth a few rolls."

"Alright, here goes nothing."

The blocks were a little unweildy to properly roll, so Tess threw them up in the air. They came down onto the table, bouncing a few times.

She read off the blocks to Bob.

"Love is like... [[/u/GaBeRockKing]]? Temporarily omnipotent."

"Wait, what?"

*** I immediately jumped to how one might somehow find a way to turn the creation of a FAI, into some sort of analogy about love.\\
Oh wait it said it /had/ to be a /bad/ analogy, well that certainly makes munchkining easier. Given a GAI can copy itself and it's not magic, it ought to be immune to reality returning to normal; which makes it the best choice I can think of that's not too ridiculous a stretch.

Now the question remains; what minimum requirements are there for a analogy to be just the right amount of bad for the effect to work. If the threshold for a analogy is low then you could do any number of comparisons about how FAI and love are both extremely desirable things.

You'know now that I think about it, the best answer to at /least a third/ of these kinds of scenarios involves the creation of GAI.
