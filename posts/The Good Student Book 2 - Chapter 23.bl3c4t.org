** There are a few different directions this could take, but I suspect that Winnum Roke is still up to shenanigans. We've seen that she's very capable at masking her presence/making people think they've dealt with her (e.g. how she handled the archmage) and she's likely tied to Gweur.

Also, does anyone else think that something is up with Nic's feelings toward Dizzy? His responses to thinking of her seem more exaggerated than ever, and this seems like it's in the realm of what Roke is capable of (minor physical changes to Nic's body).

*** I don't think it's secret hidden Winnum Roke.

The entire chapter was all about how hard the power is to manage. You can't ask it for honest people you have to ask it for <X>. It has unexpected limitations and will give you things you aren't asking for.

I suspect that instead of Winnum Roke, Nic just poorly phrased his request.

Regarding Dizzy, maybe it's just that she likes him back that's getting to him? Learning about a girl having a crush on me would make think about her a lot back when I was that age. Dizzy's been actively paying an interest to Nic, and a few chapters ago was talking about how much she thought about him etc.. It seems like natural relationship development to me.

*** A callback from Book 1 Chapter 23,

#+begin_quote
  There was a sound in the dark room, somewhere across the room. He stiffened. It sounded like soft footsteps. He opened his eyes but they hadn't adjusted to the dark and he couldn't see anything.

  He sat up and tried to shout but a hand covered his mouth and pushed him back onto the pillow.

  “Quiet, young master,” said a man's voice. It sounded young and gentle. Not threatening, not violent. The hand lifted from his mouth. “I will not hurt you. I will help you in any way I can.”

  “Help me with what?” said Nic, his words trembling out of him. The voice was kind but now he could make out a shape. A hooded head with two pinpoints of light, cold blue and piercing.

  “Whatever you wish. She has made you her vessel, her ferry to the shore.”

  “Who has?”

  “My Lady of the Shadows.”
