** Hm, looks promising. A few things:

Interruptions and parentheticals are done with em-dashes (---, alt-code =0151=) instead of regular hyphens (-). For example, the following passage

#+begin_quote
  falling and falling and standing back up-it all led up to this moment.
#+end_quote

takes extra effort to read because it's not initially clear that "up-it" is not a compound word in this case.

Secondly, I felt like a few lines there felt too abrupt, so to speak. I'm having hard time pinpointing just what feels off, but the last few lines of both Qrow's and Adam's intros feel blocky. I think both could use some extra description of just how the things happen.

Also, how was Qrow unaware of her niece's eye color? Even if there is a difference between silver eyes and Silver Eyes, it seems like something that he would've been expecting for a long time now. On that note, Qrow has two nieces. Just ignoring Yang entirely feels weird[[https://i.imgur.com/sakSGqO.jpg][.]]

*** Thanks for the formatting advice--I'll be sure to check dashes next time. Adam's intro sort of had to cut off where it did to avoid an M rating. Gratuitous civilian murder and such. Thanks for the criticism though! As for the eyes: weird, isn't it, that Qrow didn't know ruby's eye color? I can't explain it for...two arcs, though. Suffice it to say there is a reason.

Honestly, just putting whitespace around a standard hyphen is usually good enough. Similarly you should put a space after an ellipsis.

** Interesting start; been on a RWBY fan fiction kick myself for the past few weeks, mostly with stuff from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Coeur Al'Aran]]. Looking forward to seeing how this goes, especially if it's striving to be rational.

Incidentally, the direct link in the title does not work for me (I think because it's missing the www in the address). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12466638/1/Broken-Blades][Here's where I found the fic]].

***** My personal favorite story of his may be Stress Relief (after Not This Time Fate anyway) but all of his stuff is good! I'm keeping up with all of his fics barring Professor Arc.

******* Stress Relief is worth it; trust me. The fact that it's from Cinders POV alone makes it compelling. Plus CA more than understands the concept of an unreliable narrator and puts it into full effect in Stress Relief.

** I second Qrow forgetting Yang is also his niece (even if he's closer to Ruby) and the abruptness of the last line. It gave me a feeling of whiplash to see Qrow's mood to swing so hard so fast and then the chapter just ends all of a sudden. Another flub stood out to me, though.

#+begin_quote
  Qrow's shoulders slumped, tension leaving his whole body.

  "So she's still there, at least. Has she woken?"

  "Not yet. We'll do what we can."

  "Understood. Now, the other piece of news is about your niece, Summer's daughter"
#+end_quote

The first line of dialogue must be spoken by Qrow since Ozpin is the one taking care of Amber and the second is Oz responding, so the third line seems like Qrow speaking to Oz. Except the last line is clearly meant to be Oz speaking to Qrow, which contradicts the progression of the conversation. It's an easily fixable problem, but it really stood out to me.

Other than that, this is a pretty solid, if short, opening. I would've preferred a bit more detailed descriptions to compensate for the lack of visual and auditory storytelling, but it worked fine as is. The action scenes actually benefitted from the brief narration since it makes them feel as fast as they do in the show.

--------------

As for what you say is in store for the future, I'm not exactly sure how Cinder's plan didn't make sense. Her dialogue indicated that she altered it as new information came to light so Penny and Pyrrah weren't always going to be the key players she manipulated, she just saw a way that she could exploit them.

The way she went about infiltrating Beacon, rigging the tournament, and causing a panic during the penultimate match seemed straightforward enough. I don't know how she managed to hack into the tournament without anyone noticing, but the plan seemed to make sense based on what we knew at the time.

** Christ, this is /great/. Enjoyable writing, on-point characters, and from the looks of it, it has the potential to be smart as well. If they can write Jaune as a more effective thinking fighter from the beginning, I should love to see that as well.
