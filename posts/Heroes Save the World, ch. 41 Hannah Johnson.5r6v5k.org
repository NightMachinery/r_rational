** In case this was unintended: I have no idea what the hell happened there. Of course, I'm bad with names so that might contribute.

*** Villain's fingers got cut off to prevent the precog touching him and compromising villain opsec.

Little bit disappointed. I thought the villains were chrono-phantoms that could only inhabit unrealizable futures. A kind of precog nemesis. I guess they could still be timewalkers of some sort.

** The end did confuse me. Who attacked who?! Who is dead or hurt? Is it Akvo, or was Akvo doing the hurting?

*** The ending is intended to be unclear because we're in Hannah's head right now and a lot happened, very quickly, so she's as confused as you are.

However, I apparently still messed up, because if the text isn't clear enough on the fact that it's /supposed/ to be unclear, and why, then I didn't write it well enough. Sorry about that. >:P

tagging [[/u/FeepingCreature]] to avoid double-posting.

**** If it's meant to be confusing it's fine; I was just noting it to be safe.

**** It's fine, it conveys the fact that a lot of things happened fast and the situation is confusing. I was just noting the fact, like FeepingCreature. The questions were more to start discussion than for you, I think, sorry I got it all mixed up :)
