Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** When you die, you end up in the Land of the Dead, with all the other dead people, starting at the place you died (naked). The Land of the Dead is roughly like our own, but with its own continents, vegetation, animals, etc. If you're dead, you no longer have to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. If you're past the age of 25, you revert to your physical form at 25 and no longer age. If you're younger than 25, you keep aging until 25 and then stop. You don't get diseases, and you can eventually heal back from any injury. You can get worn out, but will eventually recover your stamina. However, you /can/ still die if something sufficiently violent happens to you, in which case you go to the Land of the Dead+1.

The Land of the Dead+1 is a lot like the Land of the Dead, with all the same conditions, different geography, different plants and animals, etc. If you die, you go to the Land of the Dead+2, and from there, to the Land of the Dead+3, ad infinitum to the Land of the Dead+N.

From the Land of the Dead, it's possible to have minor interactions with the Land of the Living with sufficient will and energy spent. The Land of the Living is overlaid with the Land of the Dead, and can be sensed, vaguely, by the dead, allowing sight as though in a near-black room, and hearing as though through a muffled door. The force that the dead can apply is very minor, allowing little things like causing the flame of a candle to move without wind, shaking objects ... and interacting with a Ouija board, which opens up a line of communication with the Land of the Living.

The same rule of interaction applies between the Land of the Dead and the Land of the Dead+1, and between the Land of the Dead+N and the Land of the Dead+N+1.

Given that this applies only to humans, and that this has been the case through all human history, and the Land of the Living only discovered the rule in roughly the 1800s:

*What do you think the geopolitical landscape of the Land of the Dead looks like?*

There's still scarcity in the Land of the Dead, but the bottom rungs of Maslow's hierarchy are all taken care of. The Land of the Dead /should/ have civilization, maybe at a higher degree than the Land of the Living ... but at the same time, it's got a whole lot of people from much earlier in history.

I've been trying to tweak the parameters here to get the best interplay between Lands, and I think that some amount of resource conflict might be desirable. The starting point for this project was the image of a battalion slitting their own throats so that the Land of the Living could attempt to assert control over the Land of the Dead ... but I think the current configuration needs more work to get to a point where that's easily foreseeable as a consequence of the premise.

*** Some random thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  If you're dead, you no longer have to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep.
#+end_quote

You don't have to, but you can still do all of those things? Also, can people still have children in the land of the dead?

If the answer to both of those questions is yes, then I don't see why we wouldn't just abandon the land of the living all together and hang out in the Lands of the Dead forever.

As for the geopolitical landscape of the Lands of the Dead, iirc, the dead outnumber the living 14-ish to 1 in 2018 so if the story is set in the modern era the primary Land of the Dead will have significant overpopulation issues if people haven't buggered off to lower level Lands of the Dead yet.

That said, I can easily imagine a group of people with a minority culture or religion or whatever just agreeing to commit repeated mass suicide until they reach a Land of the Dead where everyone just leaves them the fuck alone (there are some interesting logistic issues here, but I think you can make that work).

If population growth is still a thing (and doesn't plateau off by virtue of everyone being immortal), there is the interesting question of who has to move to the next Land down when resources start to get depleted. I imagine this changes pretty drastically between different Lands, as the inhabitants of each Land are mostly going to consist of the the people that didn't get to stay in the Land one level up.

**** You can still eat and drink, if you'd like to, but there's no biological function, and no biological urge. You can't have children. (Most of the actual function of that is currently just waved away at the moment as being unimportant to what I find interesting.)

The biggest thing I'd think would stop people from the Land of the Living entering into the Land of the Dead would be the fact that you come in with nothing, and face a culture that's unlikely to be much like your own. If you asked a random sample of people if they'd like to immigrate somewhere foreign to them but with all their food, drink, and healthcare taken care of ... well, the people who said "yes" would probably be the least fortune.

All technology and infrastructure needs to be built up from scratch, but that's not so onerous as it might seem, because eliminating most of the strict needs and causes for death means that they don't /need/ as much infrastructure or technology, and the people have a lot more time to work on that sort of thing, because they're not spending their days collecting calories.

*** one thing people have to deal with is all of humanity's worst villains, like Hitler. What does humanity do with them? Options are to imprison them (classically) or exile them to some Land of the Dead+N for some high N (but then you can't keep an eye on them). The latter might seem like a natural choice, given the setting, but it has some problems; they are basically free to communicate via Ouija board with the citizens of level N-1.

(Note that it doesn't seem to be possible to force someone to level N+2 if you're on level N if you don't have compatriots already on N+1.)

I guess another option is to launch someone you want to get rid of permanently is just to launch them into space. (Maybe this is the sort of option you might want to patch out.)

In each land, the people basically have to build up all technological infrastructure from scratch. This includes resource gathering, like mining and setting up the infrastructure to mine. And I=if you want computers, all hardware has to be re-constructed, all software has to be rewritten. If you're sending a team to colonize and prepare level N+1, the team needs to be made of explorers (I guess exploring is a bit easier, since you aren't in danger of physical harm) and experts on the tech-tree. (It helps, though, that they can squint into level N and read reference materials and such.)

While society will be able to optimize and produce an efficient build order, Land of the Dead level-0 tech will have evolved organically, much like the living world. Engineers will eventually rebuild the internet, etc. assuming politics allows. (Like, assuming Land-of-the-Dead isn't ruled by medieval kings who kill all heretics before they can accomplish anything, or something. But I don't think that's a stable equilibrium.) But the internet will probably look different and have less backwards-compatibility hacks because people will maybe know what they're doing from the beginning this time around?

*** *The Land of the Dead has better technology than the Land of the Living*

All the famous scientists and engineers who died ended up there, and quickly found themselves once more at the prime of their lives - able to continue researching interesting problems, and doing interesting things.

Some of them have found other pursuits; but enough are still interested in building up technology that the Land of the Dead has experienced continual technological growth from their work. This is /on top of/ the continual technological growth any time an engineer or scientist in the Land of the Living dies and brings the contents of his head with him. And this is before considering people like Ug the Caveman who, after several centuries of thought, managed to unify quantum physics with special relativity while Einstein was still in nappies.

It is believed that the technological curve rises up steeply as you move on down through Lands of the Dead; and there's a persistent rumour that someone several layers down managed to create an Unfriendly AI. However, no-one has any proof, or even knows on which layer this might have occurred - it might just be a rumour.

*Nostalgia is a powerful force*

People are used to the era in which they lived, and many prefer the aesthetics of their home era. Some try to recreate parts of their old lives in the Land of the Dead - there is, for example, a fairly close reproduction of the 1800's Buckingham Palace (and if you /dare/ try to install solar panels on it, then may God save you from Queen Victoria) inhabited by several generations of monarchy, who have formed a loose council and rule Dead England with firmness. (They're continually squabbling, until such time as someone suggests that maybe the Monarchs shouldn't be ruling England, at which point they all immediately suspend hostilities in order to Deal With the Impertinent Idiot).

Some people /certainly/ make the effort to recreate the social environment of their times; people dying in the greater southern Africa region either join the Great Empire of Shaka Zulu or get sent down several layers (yes, it is very much a multi-layer Empire).

(No-one quite knows what happened to Adolf Hitler, but there was a very large crowd of extremely angry Jews waiting for him when he died. Some think they tore him apart, some think they trampled him, some even suggest he managed to disguise himself as part of the crowd and slip away. If he's around, he's changed his name and probably moved to a new continent).

*Women get a poor deal*

For an amazing amount of history, women got a terribly bad deal. Many of these ancient sexist attitudes remain strong in the Land of the Dead. Racism, too, is alive and well and very strong.

*** Would there be any reason for people to stay alive in that case? It seems like there's no real disadvantages to dieing. Is it possible to have children if you're in the land of the dead? I'd imagine war might be a little less common because the resources are infinite /but/ getting them is a one-way ticket and it might not be as frowned upon to kill someone (more akin to exile then death). I'd think there would be little blocks of influence from each political entity, where based on their strength they have influence in layers a few back, and have influence on their layer+1.

*** Reminds me of Riverworld.

I'd expect the population of humanity to spread out. Killing people to get rid of them is much less heinous, so the first few layers are likely controlled by groups of humans whose default behavior is to kill most people to prevent dilution of their preferred culture. Everybody you meet in the first few layers is likely to kill you on sight. The repercussions of that will likely be felt on every layer.

I can imagine alternating layers of ideologies. If you manage to purge all those who resist your political ideals on layer N (and remember, purging isn't all that evil anymore), well, N+1 is now their haven. Expect them to remember, expect them to send your adherents unlucky enough to die to the layer after theirs, and expect the cycle to repeat.

How to deal with the hated leader of the ideology that pushed you to N+1? Imprison them. Their second in command ends up in control of N+2, and imprisoned in N+3.

There may be the odd layer that isn't one of the two big ideologies, but for some reason humans like to split into one of two camps. I'd expect two to dominate in the early layers.

High layers may have advertisements for lower layers, communicated up the chain: "if you have this ideology, gather on layer m". Of course, if you die on that layer you'll probably head to m*2--the logical point to meet others of similar ideology who had accidents, just like you. The size of each subsequent layer depends on the ease of dying, and how many divisors of that layer are inhabited by ideologies. Layer 360 should be interesting.

After the first several layers, humanity is usually too thin for global or even regional politics to matter that much. Expect to find most humans between deliberately chosen layers living in small bands, just like most of humanity lived through most of its existence.

Far, far down there are people who deliberately explore, and hermits who did that for a while before giving up and waiting for new friends to come by. There may be groups of humans who all ascend to the next layer repeatedly and deliberately, on a schedule. I'd expect it to be yearly or maybe once a decade. Starting over from scratch is hard, and moving forward at a constant rate is enough to keep yourself away from most people.

**** Riverworld! I think the only things I know about it are from the 2003 TV movie, which I would have watched in high school. Looking up the summary, I can see the similarities, which I'm not a huge fan of. Maybe I'll adjust it so that things are less nice.

I think that what I like about the idea is sort of "we have met the outside context problem, and it is us", where the world has to adapt to the surveillance possibilities of the Land of the Dead and the geopolitical reality of whatever nations exist there. It seems natural for a nation to want to be as "vertical" as possible, because lower layers present a serious security risk, as do higher layers.

** Let's build and exploit an exclusion zone!

Somewhere in Generic Medieval Fantasy Land there is a sphere of diameter 1 km within which it's pretty cheap (the equivalent of $30/square foot) to make a permanent two-way portal that allows travel from one region of the sphere to another. When created, portals are immediately adjacent, and must then be moved/translated/rotated to their final destination with a bit of effort. Portals cannot move through other portals. A portal can be freely toggled on and off a few times a second, and this can be used as an infinitely sharp cutting edge.

My mental model of how this goes is roughly "this is an area of vast potential economic productivity and it immediately spawns a heavily militarized walled city/manufacturing center to exploit it"

Some obvious points

- The exclusion zone gives you a fixed amount of volume to work wit, so you probably won't see many spectacular displays of open space represent huge wastes
- Portals let you break gravitational potential energy in half, so "build a waterwheel that generates arbitrary cheap power" is an obvious step, possibly using superdense fluids because of volume concerns (mercury is good for this, I think?).
- You can build deathtraps by packing a room with 1cm-spaced vertical portals that are noncontiguous - e.g. a fly who attempts to move from "the ground" to "the ceiling" will hit every intermediate point but not in ascending order. If a group of humans are in this room and the portals are deactivated, they probably do not survive their sudden non-contiguousness.
- You can tile the outside of the sphere in portals that let you redirect/ignore/no-sell incoming attacks
- You can do neat tricks with redirecting the force of an explosion in a single direction with an array of small portals surrounding the initial explosion.

Some less obvious points

- What is this city really comparatively good at, other than "cutting hard-to-cut things" and "having a short commute"?
- What does an efficient transportation network look like? I'm imagining a densely connected array of small hexagonal rooms, each of which has six portals to other hexagonal rooms or exits. There's some balancing to be done here between increasing max-flow and minimizing travel distance, but I've come up with a bitstring-based addressing system that gives approximately exponential number-of-reachable-places as a function of distance. Can we do better? Is this obviously wrong?
- What would being a civilian in this city look like?

Cooling. A series of micro-portals near something hot (like a CPU) allow it to have reasonably close contact with a far greater volume of cooled air than a non-portal-enhanced CPU; plus, some of those portals can come out in separate refrigerators, improving the cooling efficiency even further.

Also, unless there's a lightspeed delay between entering and exiting a portal, I suspect that if you really know what you're doing, you can either disprove Special Relativity or communicate acausally - though probably not very far into the past.

Delivering utilities (water, electricity, etc.) through portals allows people to avoid laying miles upon miles of cables and/or pipelines. They're probably colour-coded, as well, because you do NOT want to get the sewerage portal mixed with the water portal.

**** Yup, definitely. Set up a few tall low-pressure tubes which contain items that perpetually fall and build up velocity. Swap out the bottom portal to fire.

The other consideration I had in the last two months was that you don't want to the city to take up the entire sphere, you want it to be built just a bit (~1m) within it so that you can open up portals on the surface directly to the inside of the sphere for manufacturing efficiency.
