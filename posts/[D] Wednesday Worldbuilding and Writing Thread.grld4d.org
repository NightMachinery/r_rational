Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Situation: the System just happened, but not to everybody. (Think "Homicidal Aliens are Attacking" style, since that was part of my inspiration.) So some people have LitRPG powers and some don't, and there are monsters either coming or here already and you're not really sure which.

You and your spouse don't have the System, but your twelve-year-old daughter does.

How do you advise her? Assume you are a reader of this sub, LitRPG, and fantasy/gaming in general.

*** Your world is now basically a game with no existing walkthroughs, permadeath, and probably a bunch of unpatched exploits. You know what you need?

You need to become a Scout. Or any information-gathering class - seer, psychic, detective, etc.

In an undocumented permadeath game, the player who survives is the one who figures out the exploits and the monster tips. You want to be that person.

Plus, if you are that person, you can trade with everyone else the most valuable currency of a strange new world - lifesaving information.

Think about Vikings or conquistadors preparing a raid in foreign lands. Did they need warriors? Sure. But no warrior was as valuable as an expert scout, navigator or interpreter. In any group setting, "I can kill people" is nowhere as useful as "I know where the killers are, and I know their weakness."

And before you've got a team around you, Scout often has the skills to avoid combat and identify more or less friendly strangers.

There's a catch, of course. In any system, Scout is almost never the very best class. But to know the very best class in advance, you'd have to know the game system.

In a world where nobody knows the game system, and everybody needs to know it, "Scout" is the best class.

**** On the other hand, maybe there is good documentation of the rules, or expert players with good advice. In that case you might try to spot useful exploits in advance.

Some exploit categories to look for:

- "meta" powers like Power-Copying or Power-Sharing, "subversion" powers like Hypnosis, "coordination" powers like Long-range Telepathy, or any "time" power (haste, future-sight, past-sight). These powers are hard to balance well, so they're probably either too weak (ignore) or too strong (get them!).

- "truth" powers are super-valuable for teamwork among strangers. "Lie Detector" or "Unbreakable Oath" or similar powers can be amazing to help your faction grow and stay effective.

- "supplier" jobs like Alchemist or Weaponsmith. If there's a lot of people and/or a lot of teamwork in the world, and if you don't have to fight on the front lines to level up, supply jobs can be high value and low risk.

- "cost immune" class-identity pairings, like having a soul-damaging superpower while being a golem with no human soul to damage. These are often hard to pull off (unless you're a character in someone else's novel!) but can be game-breakingly powerful.

- stacking buffs or stacking cost reductions. Often there's something in the game that lets you drive a power cost to zero, or multiply a power effect over and over.

- setting up monster farms or slaughter tunnels for cheap levelling. Depends on how people level up, but almost any "danger gets you levels" system can be exploited, especially if players of different levels can sneakily cooperate.

- monsters who can switch sides and become allies. This is often game-breaking if you're in place to pull it off.

I was picturing her as sort of a shadow assassin almost like Jason from He Who Fights With Monsters, but there was something about that that just didn't sit right, aside from an ordinary kid not having the brutality to pull that off.

*** I'm not sure that you could say. There are common tropes in LitRPG, but there's no guarantee that they apply in your situation. Assuming that the whole system isn't laid out from you at the start (it might be!), you don't know what the dominant strategies are. Heck, you don't even know what the enemies are like, and what you might need to prioritize against them. You also don't know how much leeway you have, whether you can bank resources for later or need to fight all-out from the start.

Most of your advice should depend on what information the system can give you, so I suppose step one is, before you touch anything, look through all of the tooltips, skills, and everything like that. Come to an understanding of how the system works before you try to put points into place, pick feats, allocate skills, or whatever its actual properties end up being. Get information on how many other people are "playing", what their capabilities are, how easy it is to have different roles, what other roles people have chosen, etc. Figure out what the monsters are like, what works against them and what doesn't.

If you have to send a twelve-year-old out into the field without knowing much ... well, she's pretty much screwed, and a lot of what you can offer in terms of support is 1) crunching numbers and looking at system math and 2) mental/emotional support.

**** The system is laid out for you in that you know what skills and classes exist (which encompasses basically any theme you can think of) but light on details about what they actually do.

As for how many people are "players" I'm going for something more than the initial 10,000 from Homicidal Aliens but still far less than the 75 million that would be 1% of the population. Maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of an even one million worldwide. Initially none are close enough to contact.

Changing roles is possible in that you can re-spec every ten levels but the process is unpleasant and essentially removes you from the fight for a full day, so it's not something to be undertaken lightly. Unless you're spec'd for flexibility or filling multiple roles to begin with, but then you risk being bad at lots of things instead of good at anything.

Overall, assume you have to take someone who is woefully unprepared for this, and turn her into a superhero, because when the monsters come they will be actively hunting her so if she's useless she's dead. What would you advise her to pick in terms of starting power-set? Pretty much anything is possible but it starts small and gets stronger. (For example, a Level 1 Illusionist might be able to provide battlefield control and distractions but not much else; a Level 100 Illusionist can alter reality within the range of her powers. Then again, on any given System world /maybe/ one person will reach Level 100.)

*** If it's my daughter, then my overriding imperative is for her to stay /safe/. Second on the list is for her to remain a good person; I /will/ disapprove of her going around murdering people, no matter the reason why. (She's twelve years old, she should /not/ be doing that).

So... I'd probably give this a good deal more thought in a real situation. But I think I'd advise her to go for some sort of crafting class. Something that /makes/ items which can be used by other System-positive people. Items like a shield that also protects against mental attacks, or a headband that makes the wearer more intelligent, or a brooch that hides the wearer from any monsters.

This immediately means that other System-positive people will have reason to protect her (because she makes nice stuff for them); it means that she has a source of the best gear (she can make it for herself); and it keeps her off the front lines (she is /not/ a meatshield, but she can make the meatshield even tougher). Plus, with any luck, she levels by making new equipment, so she doesn't need to become a killer at all.

A crafting class would make sense, too, for all the reasons you said. The main reason I'm not going that route is because I don't want to write that story.

Specifically: would you recommend she continue going to school and trying to live a normal life?

********* Oh, she /definitely/ keeps going to school and getting a bit of normal life.

Grinding levels is something she does for at least an hour every afternoon, after homework. In a variety of safe ways, including playing a paintball match (to grind dodging and/or stealth skills), chess matches (to grind raw INT), or bowling (to grind DEX). Each of these, I keep track of her score and make sure to keep her informed how it's improving, trying to trigger her competitive nature into pushing harder for more EXP. If possible, I put her against continually escalating opponents as well; building up to (say) a two-dozen-army-veterans-versus-one paintball match, or a series of chess matches against the Crafty chess engine; because I doubt she gets EXP from easy contests.

But, one way or another, one way this whole apocalypse thing is going to be /over/. When that happens, I want to have a daughter who's still a sane, balanced human being, with a basic education behind her. (I'm not sure if this 'System' thing will continue working once the Apocalypse is done with). I /don't/ want her to have put everything into this strange System and to have cut off all other paths for the rest of her life. Hence, school and normal life continue.

*** The first major piece of advice is to think about the number of fights you're going to get into in your career.

If you're active once every few days, then over decades, you'll need to win /thousands/ of fights.

This means that, when you go out, you're either ensuring odds better than 999:1 in your favor, or you don't live to see high levels.

Next, I'd look at skills with "diminishing returns" or "negative externalities". Basically, are we in a system (like D&D) where experience-to-advance goes up based on /total/ level?

In, D&D, if you're offered "free" class levels outside of your main build run you should run the hell away. Like if an artifact offers you a free boost from (Mage 5) to (Mage 5 / Warrior 2) it's a horrible trap. The problem is that the warrior levels will /massively/ increase the experience it takes to get to Mage 6.

But, beyond that, I'd look to see how the system is balanced.

One reasonably common thing is to try to balance classes around /combat potential/. And this gets weird because mages also get a bunch of non-combat utility powers that would be a massive quality of life improvement.

If we set aside monster killing and just asked if I'd like the downtime activities of a high level Sorcerer or an equally high level Ranger, then I'm going Sorcerer any day. One of them gets powers with minimal practice and eventually can have a flying house. The other has to train all the time and is good at shooting arrows.

** Has anyone played warframe? It's an old live service (7+ years) loot-grinder-shooter with robot space ninjas.

Quick (relevant) plot synopsis (To be clear they release plot at a pace of 1 hour of story gameplay a year, so it's not like I am ruining much) A spaceship gets stuck in the "void" between solar systems and the people on it go crazy, except for the children. The children, the so called ten-oh, are able to control warframes through some sort of telepathic link and channel powers through them. And there are liches and samurai and super AIs and greek gods and stuff. It's all very confusing. I actually barely care about the plot, the ambience of the presented material is the good part.

I really enjoy the setting. For one, it's constrained to just the solar system (because /bad things/ happen to those who try to leave) which allows it to feel like a space/sci-fi setting while also feeling claustrophobic, constrained, and familiar (e.g. like setting things on Earth). Sure the Moon is some sort of wrecked alien artifact called Lua now, but I know what that is and what it looks like. And Venus has been terraformed but it is still filled with deadly natural elements and what not.

For another it's very melancholy. Most of the characters and beings in it are broken beyond repair, the last of their kind. The main faction in the solar system, which clones humans since they became infertile, has long since thrown genetic stability out of the window, they are going to end soon. The super AIs are all broken or insane, can't be made any more, and mostly just dick around for their own purposes. The player Tenno/Warframes are all one off flukes / "one of a kind artifacts" (except where the game mechanics conflict with that).

It would be a really cool setting for a story, I'm just not sure how to create a similar world without straight up copying it.

*** Probably few enough people have played Warframe that you could straight up copy it without that many noticing. You also can get away with a lot of copying by having a specific enough sense of style that by the time you're done trying to copy it's not a copy anymore. The "imagine Wes Anderson trying to remake Fight Club" approach.

But I've never played it so I can't be influenced by anything more than your description of it so...

Someone built an AI that underwent a hard takeoff, disassembled a large chunk of the solar system to build a Dyson swarm supercomputer, and runs the vast majority of humanity as programs in a simulated paradise. This story isn't about them. It's about the descendants of the handful of weirdos who were left behind because they really, really, actually, truly, at their core would be happier in the real world, the leftover bits of the solar system that weren't worth deconstructing, and the mess made by generations of people dicking around with supertechnology.

Mercury and most of the asteroids are gone; the Brain recycled them for parts. Venus keeps getting closer to the sun. The sun has so many satellites that it has a grainy texture.

Earth is a nature preserve. Someone wanted to end animal suffering, so now prey animals die of serotonin overdose when caught. Predatory animals evolved to be faster and too weak to actually kill their prey now that they don't have to. It's an interesting trip but anybody who actually liked this stuff would've uploaded already, so almost nobody lives there. Also you're used to the quiet of space and Earth is really loud.

The handful of uploaded people who are weird enough that they'd actually get a kick out of playing with your sad lot sometimes show up as beings of pure light or robots or nanoswarms or humans or whatever, handing out various god-technologies for a joy ride before going home to whatever it is they do.

The original scientific paper that spells out how to make your own superintelligence is freely available. You can do it in a long weekend. But if you follow the FAI utility function it'll immediately fold itself into the Brain. And if you make it follow some other function, the Brain will alpha-strike it before it can bootstrap into a threat, modifying however much is necessary so that it doesn't go paperclipper or negative-utility-maximizer on anyone. The AIs that survive that with any coherency are all floating around doing their own projects, which nobody can understand.

There's always the option of uploading, but if it actually would've made you happy then the Brain would've sent an agent out to convince you by now. So you're stuck out in the discarded bits of this solar system trying to come up with something to do with yourself.

Setting aside the ethical questions this statement raises, Warframe is actually fairly well known, even amongst people who aren't avid gamers. It's in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-played_video_games_by_player_count][top 50 games]] with the largest playerbase. It's won multiple awards over the years as well. Even my rural southern coworkers who don't play videogames have heard enough about it (from marketing of other acquaintances?) to recognize the name the first time I mention it.

I don't think that its a good idea to begin your creative process by strait up copying another work, unless you explicitly label your derivative as fanfiction while giving due credit to the original creators. Maybe OP should write fanfiction to get a feel for what it's like to set up a story in that sort of world, and then OP can later write a separate story in their own original setting incorporating what they've learned from that experience.

But in the interest of not copying, the world-building ideas you've raised in your comment are a good jumping-off point. I do think OP would benefit from having a larger pool of creative works to draw inspiration from. The more great ideas he or she encounters, the less likely it is that any one copyrighted idea will be too prominent in composing OP's new world. For example, the manga /Blame!/ by Tsutomu Nihei explores a very different futuristic scifi world, but its mysterious setting still conveys similar feelings of claustrophobia/decay/melancholy.

***** I probably phrased that more extremely than I should've because I was posting when I should've been going to bed.

My point is more... if you want to make a story about a kid going to a wizard school with four animal-themed houses and a racism allegory with magical ability taking the place of race, just do it. Don't call it Hogwarts and don't do a beat by beat recreation of the plot with the names filed off, but these concepts are way too broad for somebody to own, even in combination.

If the work is well-known enough, anything even remotely similar (ie: being about wizard school is enough in Harry Potter's case) is going to be called derivative, because hugely popular things tend to be folks' only point of reference in that area (Harry Potter is the only wizard story anyone who's not into wizard stories is likely to have read). And if it's not so well known, the only people who like it are likely to have consumed other similar media and won't be so quick to complain about broad-level similarities.

*** I'd steal some stuff from interstellar. The earth is dying(for some reason or another) and space ships(Arks) are sent out to different star-systems in hopes of finding a habitable planet to colonize. The Arks work using a warp drive using the periodic element 127 Uv(Universum(i made that up)) carry 100 people and 1000 embryos to start colonies in case the rest of humanity can't follow. Having used all of the Universum to be found on earth to get there, there is no way back. Sadly all star-systems are desolate leaving the Arks stranded. Luckily for a few ships the AI picks up on readings of Universum in some of the systems making a home trip available, but it takes centuries to gather enough. The crew enters cryo-sleep waiting for the day the AI has collected enough to return. Once they awaken an analysis of the embryos forces crew to birth them due to slight damage from the warp jump(this gives the children their special powers). Upon return to earth humanity does no longer use normal artificial wombs but a new type of artificial womb that births 10000s of identical babies at once(generally referred to by their batch number ie. someone was born in batch #598842). This makes the returning children referred to as True-borns(or Unicus ie. there only exists one of them) with the adults dying because they gave up their cryopods to the children when the ship returned.

I dunno if any of this makes any sense, it's quite late and i'm tired :p but take whatever you want and build on it. Also i don't really have any ideas for AIs going rogue atm.

They would easily be able to produce enough of it for ship to make a return trip. We are already able create and store antimatter for quite some periods of time and i have no doubts we'll quickly improve on the limits we have there. Maybe if you argued it uses the special properties of anti Carbon or something like that to work, but then there really would no difference to my made up element.

I personally wouldn't use antimatter in any other cases than energy storage and bomb-manufacturing.

** I'm writing an Isekai and not taking it terribly seriously. I'm having fun with it, and not caring too much about making everything realistic.

That said, on a whim I decided to make it so humans make gods stronger when they worship them, while other species cannot. It's... resulting in a lot more racism toward demi-humans than I realized when I made it that way. After all, the gods that spend resources helping all humanoids are going to get less gratitude and loyalty from humans, while the gratitude of other humanoids is not terribly useful to them. Meanwhile human supremacist gods get stronger and stronger the more they favour humans at the expense of everyone else. Naturally, this also makes the non-humans a lot more susceptible to being taken in by demon lords and all that jazz.

I'm having fun with it, but at the same time I really don't want the primary focus of the book to be about racial issues, so I'm having the main character be an indiscriminate asshole toward everyone, humans and other humanoids alike.

** In a magic system where the only magical ability is heating air, and magical energy is taken 1 to 1 from the human's body, how many calories could the average person produce before passing out or dying? Since there is conservation of energy in this world, mages themselves do not overheat as the sugar, carbs, fat, and ATP in their body is simply sent to hyperspace and have their chemical bonds broken at the desired location.

*** I'm not positive, but I think blood sugar levels dropping would pass you out before anything else does. Google says anything below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is potentially harmful, anything below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is actively dangerous. Might depend on how the energy is taken, though (if it prioritizes fat over sugar, for example, you might have something like Fat Gum from Hero Academia--where he builds fat to power himself, and when he finishes doing something crazy, he's thin again).

*** From my memories of marathon training: your body keep around 2000 calories of glycogen easily accessible in your blood.

You don't exactly pass out when you get there, but there's a pretty major drop in function until your body has time to replenish.

** I'm on and off doing worldbuilding on a superhero project of mine, based off various comic-book tropes deconstructed and reconstructed. And there's this particular superpower I'm trying to justify without too much handwaving, but I'm not sure how.

i have a character whose powerset is similar to Access, co-owned by both Marvel and DC. She can sorta do a fusion dance of two people temporarily, creating a person who has abilities similar to those she has fused together, and who remembers a backstory that is a narrative blend of the backstories of their constituents.

I rather like this power, but I'm not sure how to make it Worm-y or grounded.

*** To make it Worm-y, have the fusing power hijack the attention of the pre-fusion powers' Shards. The fusing Shard funnels the fused Shards' power through itself for a time. The people whose powers were fused lose their passenger for that duration. Your character would then have a cooldown time during which time they wouldn't be able to use their power. Training over time would increase the duration of fusion, decrease the cooldown time, and maybe allow for fusing additional powers.

It would probably be a Master effect.

**** You have good ideas, but this isn't actually a Worm fic lol, it's original fiction, and there aren't shards. But this was still useful, thanks!

*** Imo the best way to make it Worm-y is probably to have a base power (flight, lasers, element manipulation, etc) and then build the fusion power on top of it. So you have two powered individuals and you fuse their powers into one + spin it so it's related to the base power.

If Totally-Not-Access has the ability to shoot ice beams, then when she fuses Generic-Mover-Hero and Generic-Shaker-Hero the resulting Fusion-Hero has the ability to become an ice missile that freezes a huge part of area it hits while doing no damage to the hero itself.

The power's main weakness would be pretty obvious: it's signature base power means that anyone will realize quickly that Totally-Not-Access is involved. This means that she would have to think carefully about what 'combo' to go with first (if she's on a team).

The main limit should be up to you and what you want to achieve narratively. Either have it last for a set amount of time (a few hours to a few days) or for a set amount of uses. Maybe give it a hard limit so she can't make another fusion until the first one is undone. You could explore a lot of interesting ideas if you have a 'fusion individual' that doesn't want to be separated.

Another drawback could be to give the power an element of addiction, like Teacher's power has. People could get addicted to being in the fusion state, or alternatively the power could push the individuals into either loving or hating each other. Maybe Not-Access' base power gets slightly stronger for every successful fusion, or she loses her base power after a fusion but gains some sort of Thinker power that lets her think faster or command others better, etc. Remember that most powers in Worm encourage their users to use them, whether they want to or not.

The user's mentality is important too, there's not much of a point in giving that power to someone that would never use it. So the power of giving other powers or making others stronger would likely go to an individual whose main fundamental flaw is that they don't think too highly of themselves and would rather delegate their tasks to others, that could also fit with the ironic angle where such an individual could become an exceptional leader (should they develop enough confidence) because of their ability and experience at choosing the right people for the job.

**** Whoah. That was pretty well-analyzed, and you make many extremely good points.

When I first envisioned her, I was thinking about her temporarily creating a whole new person, while the people the fusion are based on disappear temporarily (sent into something analogous to a Hammer Space).

I'll say that I really do like your analysis of her personality, so thanks!

*** Maybe the power can set up some kind of unstable quantum entanglement between two souls forcing them to merge. once the entanglement breaks the souls separates and moves separately again.
