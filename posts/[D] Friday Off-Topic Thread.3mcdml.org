Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** There is some crazy interesting things happening all over the US right now. The Chinese head of state is visiting the west coast tech centers while the Pope is neck-deep in politics on the east. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3mc0hy/boehner_will_resign_from_congress/][The Republican Party is about to burst into flames]], and we're still *months* away from the first primaries!

I wonder what went through some of those CEO's heads when Xi asked them to stop giving the NSA access to the information of Chinese citizens. Which world power do you obey?

I wonder what the right thinks when the Pope is more liberal than they are.

I wonder if Clinton can survive her past, and if Sanders' will be enough of an asset.

And, worst (best?) of all, this is the first presidential election that millennials can vote in.

Things are gonna get strange.

*** It's easy enough for the right to turn on the Pope.

Denouncing the Pope seems like good strategy, if you're a Republican candidate, especially since there's some perceived resistance among the conservative American bishops to the Pope (some of which you can read into [[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/us/pope-francis-speech-to-the-bishops-of-the-united-states-of-america.html][his speech to those bishops yesterday]]).

The Clinton/Sanders thing ... I don't really think that Hillary's campaign has kicked into high gear yet. They're saving themselves for closer to the actual primaries, which is one of the advantages of being the assumed nominee. Every prediction market I've looked at has had her as the favorite, and I trust the prediction markets a lot more than I trust most other things. Because the prediction markets are also 60/40 on a Democratic win, I think Hillary is the most likely winner in 2016. But I'll wait on more data to come in before I place my own bets.

While this is all true, it's worth noting that the Catholic Church's social and moral opinions form a decent benchmark of what counts as the mainstream, respectable, /conservative/ (as opposed to reactionary, fascist, or neoliberal) Right.

** I've been trying to formalize what makes a good mystery for a few days now, mostly because there's a good chance that whatever I'm writing when I'm done with /Shadows of the Limelight/ is going to be one of those.

I watch a lot of (police) procedurals, partly because they're easy to watch while doing other things, and they seem to have creating an episode of television down to a science. Start with a dead body. Find some connection, like a likely suspect, or a piece of unique evidence, which drives toward the next scene. Some minor mystery is revealed which shows that they're on the wrong track, but leads them to the right track. Keep doing that until you've run out the clock, then in the last ten minutes get the /right/ suspect along with sufficiently incriminating evidence that the audience will just assume that a conviction will follow (or kill the suspect in self-defense, or extract a confession).

I just haven't been able to figure out why this formula sometimes works well and other times doesn't.

*** Mysteries aren't so different from other fiction. As Aristotle puts it:

#+begin_quote
  "Of 'simple' plots and actions the worst are those which are 'episodic.' By this I mean a plot in which the episodes do not follow each other /probably/ or /inevitably/. [...] But this is bad work, since tragedy represents not only a complete action but also incidents that cause fear and pity, and this happens most of all when the incidents are /unexpected/ and yet one is a consequence of the other. For in that way the incidents will cause more amazement than if they happened mechanically and accidentally, since the most amazing accidental occurrences are those which seem to have been providential, for instance when the statue of Mitys at Argos killed the man who caused Mitys's death by falling on him at a festival. Such events do not seem to be mere accidents. So such plots as these must necessarily be the best."
#+end_quote

The mystery is just one amidst a whole class of stories with twist endings. If the twist is good - completely obvious and /necessary/ in retrospect - then it won't matter whether the reader figures it out before the reveal. If they do, they'll congratulate themselves on being clever, but either way they'll congratulate /you/. If the ending is arbitrary, insufficiently foreshadowed, overly coincident, or inappropriate to established character traits, readers will be disappointed whether they guess how things are going to go or not.

The bit you mention about nesting small mysteries in large ones is similarly general: Each twist and turn of a great story is, itself, frequently a smaller great story.

Do you mean why some shows work and other don't, or why some episodes of a show work, while other episodes of the same show don't?

If the later, I'd ask, what is the quality spread on a good episode of, say, Law and Order, and a bad one? Personally, I don't think that there is much of a spread. To me, virtually all episodes fall under "decent enough to watch to kill boredom, but not something that I'd particularly miss."

The former is a much more interesting question, but I won't even hazard a guess other than "how charismatic the actors are."

**** I mean both, to some extent.

Within a single show you're /mostly/ removing the variables of characters and setting, along with other more amorphous things like lighting, setting, direction, etc., so that you're just down to looking at the actual mystery cases themselves. With all other variables remaining constant, you can just look at what's working on the level of the mystery itself. If the variance from episode to episode is small, then close examination should be able to find the source of that variance and hopefully increase overall quality. (IMDB allows you to [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0203259/eprate][sort episodes by user rating]]; I agree that variance between episodes is not that high, but it does exist.)

In other words, I know the basic structure used to make the plot work but haven't figured out all the variables that make it work /well/. And obviously when I'm writing, I'm doing prose instead of television scripts, usually longform instead of short episodes that maintain the status quo.

Ok, just did some statistics, the variance is 0.2677 of a point.

If you remove the top 10 and bottom 10 data points, variance falls to a measly 0.0082 of a point.

Even if statistically relevant, (and the non-independent nature of voting makes that unlikely) I doubt that anyone would be able to do pattern matching to determine what makes an episode more highly rated.

*** For me, standard (police) procedurals are boring. Others, like /Veronica Mars/ or /House/ are riveting. I think it has to do with watching experts at work. Veronica is excellent at finding clues, knows whom to ask for observations, and how to extract from them observations useful to her case. House and his team practice lateral thinking, and House is Holmes - you know he'll wow you in the end.

The other factor is believability. Veronica gets so much screen time that the audience can come to see her as a real person, dealing with real issues, fairly quickly. In /House/, the teams are small, but much of the episode's time is devoted to fleshing out the people suffering from the mystery malady. The show did well in including the audience as another member of the team: at first, doctors on the team are colleagues, but still strangers; focus is on the case. As we spend more time on more cases, working with our colleagues, we learn a bit more about who they are. Eventually they become our friends. And we learn our god of a boss is an incredibly flawed human being.

Standard procedurals lack the above in subtle ways I can't describe in detail without watching a few, but as one example, take /Person of Interest/. The first season, the bespectacled guy is the expert. He somehow knows whom to help, and provides magic Batman technology as assistance. However, we come to learn he's actually not the expert, but the expert's creator. He's created his masterpiece, so he's not interesting any more. And this new expert is unknowable; we can't learn how they do what they do, and they aren't personable, so they're not a Holmes, either.

At this point the show should have switched its focus to exploring the new expert, but it stayed a procedural. I lost interest, since the show lost its expert, and the replacement had no storyline or personality driving each episode.

*** Police Procedurals on TV are massively hampered (IMO) by the fact that you can only have so many characters. I just started Longmire (which I like) but I can often call the murderer (etc).

In the real world, it's often the obvious person, or when you find out who did it there's no real reason. (Some drunk jerk). Neither of those make for a compelling story.

Typically for TV shows, it's everything else that makes it enjoyable. Columbo's hook (show the murder, see how the Peter Falk figures it out) was a good twist. Other shows (Sherlock) throw twist after twist after twist.

** Tinder is turning me into a bad person, and I'm not sure if that's a bad thing. (And yes, I do mean "Tinder" as in the dating/hookup app.)

Ok so it's not turning me into a bad person exactly, but it's definitely causing me to be much more judgmental. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, the only reason I'm on Tinder is for casual encounters. I even make sure to say exactly that in my profile description. It's worked rather well thus far. Match with girl on Tinder, message for a little bit, get her phone number, text for a little bit, go on date, hopefully go back to one of our respective homes, rinse and repeat. As a whole I consider it a net positive for both parties because we both end up with what we want out of the interaction.

But the problem is that I've done it more than a few times now and I've become unsettlelingly efficient with my method. I've started treating the women I'm interacting with more as pieces of data with a possible solution (sex), than I treat them as actual human beings. Basically Tinder is slowly draining away my humanity.

I really don't want to stop though. I have little interest in a girlfriend at this point in my life, it's the easiest/most efficient method I've found for instigating casual encounters, and like I said earlier both parties (thus far) have always walked away happy.

I suppose I'm just having a bit of an ethical dilemma with the whole thing.

** OK, so here's an idea I've been toying around with, and it formed the part of my last chapter of DMPOR and provoked a rather ugly debate on [[/r/hpmor][r/hpmor]].

"Systemic Assholes" or "Systemic Amorality"

The idea that a system can be specifically designed to act in a counter-productive or immoral way while allowing all parties to be (in their mind) moral.

My example was a low level bureaucrat following orders. He doesn't really have enough information to judge that his action is immoral, because "it's always been done that way" and his action isn't obviously immoral. (Visitors are not allowed here).

He's also deliberately (by the people who designed the system) unable to acquire the information that would allow him to determine that his actions are immoral and counterproductive.

It seems to me quite plausable that the primary purpose of some (exact number open for debate) organizations is to allow systemic immorality.

Consider a relatively annoying example: the call center for a cable company. The people in it are good, but they lack the ability to help you. You get charged for equipment you can't return because the person on the call doesn't have the information on that. Signing up is one mouse click, but cancelling is a convoluted phone mess.

That didn't just happen, but none of the people who you'd encounter in trying to cancel cable are trying to thwart you. But they can't lower your rates (etc) unless you say magic words and if they prompt you they may get fired.

Now, suppose that the original designers of this phone tree get fired for some reason. (Karma, poetic justice, or whatever). By the Peter Principle, the current people running the company are incompetent. And now you have a /systemic asshole/ and who exactly is to blame?

You can apply this to many organizations. I don't really have any answers, its just a phenomenon I've noticed with increasing frequency over the last few years. THere's a tension of scale. Network effects want larger organizations, but then you have a diffusion of knowledge and a mismatch between authority and contact with end users, and another S.A. is born.

Obviously this is just a gambit of the original inventors to get to Plausible deniability, but it can outlive the inventors and become societal.

I don't think this is true. The vast majority of evil systems aren't designed by evil people, they're designed by good people to work with like ten guys. Then, as they grow, the system is constantly kludged and modified in little ways by people who don't have the full picture. Those people don't even realize they're making moral decisions, they're just trying to keep the system working at all under new conditions.

After a few generations of that, you get a Frankenstein monster made of duct tape and twine that doesn't reflect the will of any of its creators. It exists for its own sake, with its own perverse incentives accidentally built-in and fed into positive feedback loops.

The evil people swoop in afterwards, once there are subtle broken pieces they can use for profit. They might contribute to making the system even more amoral, but the initial cracks usually aren't anyone's fault. That's just what happens when you build a thing without specifically taking the effort to be good.

For example, originally the cable company had technicians work directly on everything. Then when they bolted a call center onto their operation, coordinating everything was a mess. The complication was costing them sales, so someone streamlined the ordering process. Training the call center on anything is a complicated hassle, but it's not really needed. They can just have a simple front-end that handles things for them. Presto, sales go up, lost customers go down, and everything is perfect for everyone.

**** In some cases, but not all. I'll give an obviously intentional example I encountered when I was younger: XBox live subscription. Subscribing is easy, and the monthly fee automatically renews unless you specifically tell it not to. There is a button on a website, you press it and enter your account details and give them money and you are done. Theoretically, unsubscribing should be even easier, because you already have an account and don't need to give them your bank details. A small, simple button followed by an 'are you sure' notification would do it. Instead you have to ring a call centre.

First you talk to a robot, and unsubscribing is not an option that is listed, you have to press the 'other issues' button to talk to a person. Then you tell the person you want to unsubscribe, then you get transferred to what they tell you is the billing department but is technically called customer retention. There they will attempt to convince you not to leave. The whole process is riddled with long delays listening to waiting music. All in all, it takes 2-3 hours, and I had to call up a second time because I ran out of spare time listening to waiting music.

I am pretty sure their goal was to make the process so inconvenient that some percentage of people put it off or didn't bother, allowing the monthly cost to continue to siphon from their account. I was young at the time, and 2 months of fees extra left my account as a result.

The power of trivial inconvenience.

I think this is wrong - it's a gambit of the original inventors to get /other people to work for them/, because they can't accomplish their goals alone. It's much like a non-evil organization, except worse, because this one is designed to get people to go along with something they might otherwise object to.

That's my guess, too.

Like, for example, if you're a writer and you get high, you may make creative breakthroughs that you wouldn't make sober, daring, risky creative leaps that you wouldn't come to while sober. Now, of course, what you produce is probably going to need some sober fine tuning, but inebriation can breed creative ideas pretty well. But maintaining them in coherency to your work is usually a problem.

- Speculations about the fear of AI and AI Singletons.

- A seeming reference to Roko's Basilisk.

- Speculation on the values of aliens.

** I'm trying to decide if first person perspective or third person perspective is better for the story I'm trying to write.

I think the problem is that I'm trying to take a very huge story spanning an entire world over the course of centuries, and scale it down to a few characters trying to live their lives as the world is upended. The issue though is I feel like its not actually all that interesting to focus in on my main character that much. My novel is 143 pages and the main character never even manages to get out of her home town until the very end. I try to make it interesting and have the events unfold around her slowly to bring the character and reader into the world, but looking back now, I worry that all I really manage to do is tell psuedo slice of life story in a fantasy universe.

I could pull back the perspective to include more of the world, different characters, stuff going on at the same time, etc, but then I'd have to change off from first person perspective, and I rather like first person for the most part. It gives a great angle to understand the character and how she sees the world, but it limits what I can do in terms of scope. The character is just a girl from a small town on a small island, she's not a politician or military officer, so I can't draw her into the intrigue quickly without it feeling forced. I've got this huge story spanning a whole world, but I want to be able to focus in and tell stories about people.

I'm also really looking for a helper/brainstormer, someone who is willing to chat with me, shoot the shit, and help me pull the plot together. Maybe even a co-author, I'm pretty confident in my writing, but I could always use help. So yeah, if anyone has interest in helping create an interesting science fantasy steampunk space opera story, please get at me.

**** I thought about that, but I'm worried it will come off as a bit jarring. Maybe it's just me but I've never gotten much enjoyment out of stories with first person perspective that jumps around like that.

One thing I was thinking was, the way I've written the story so far, its set as if its the main character's journal and she's writing about everything that's happened to her. I could break that up, add journal entries and news articles and letters between characters and do the whole thing like its a collection of in-universe source material, but I'm not sure how well received that will actually be, or how much of the larger story I'd be able to cram into such a format. The advantage with 3rd person is it lets you pull back and look at things from an objective outside perspective, describing things in details the characters might not know or understand.

Just as a rough example, say I want to describe a nuclear explosion.

In a first person perspective, I can describe what they see and experience. The blinding flash, the overpressure blast, the fires and dust and wind that's kicked up.

But if want to describe the explosion from a bird's eye view, I can get into much more detail, the aircraft that drops the bomb, how it detonates and such. Things the character doesn't know.

Is it possible to mix first and third and not have it come off as awkward? I'm not sure how I'd manage the transition if so. This would be so much easier in a lot of ways with a visual medium then a written one.

This actually seems interesting but I've not read that series, and I'm not sure how what you mean by framing device. It sounds like what I'm going for, with most of the story in first person, just backing out into third enough to get a view of the wider world, but I'm not sure how that would exactly translate into text? Is it broken up by chapter, with some chapters as 1st and some as 3rd? Does it switch within the body of the text somehow?

******* It's /usually/ divided by chapters. Though sometimes not.

A framing device is basically ... okay, so there are a bunch of pilgrims from different backgrounds, all traveling from Southwark to Canterbury Cathedral. Someone gets the bright idea to have a story-telling contest, so then they sit around telling stories to each other, which make up the bulk of the text. And that's /The Canterbury Tales/.

Or, a historian is going around collecting stories following the zombie war in order to produce an oral history. And that's /World War Z/. Or Scheherazade narrates a set of tales to the sultan over the course of many nights so that he will have a reason not to kill her. And that's /Arabian Nights/. Or Verbal Kint is being interrogated about Keyser Soze. And that's /The Usual Suspects/.

What you seem to desire is a majority first-person novel, with bits that are third person. So what you would traditionally do is to set all of those first-person bits (the bulk of the novel) within a frame; someone is reading a story written by the character after the fact, the character is relating the story to a historian, etc. If you're in a more exotic science fictional or magical world, you can have this be a projected reconstruction, or a brain scan, or something weird like that. I would probably switch from inner story to outer story with either scene breaks or chapter breaks.

Another common construction that gets used is to have a frame story only for the first part, then join up the inner and outer stories. For example, the main character is being questioned about how he betrayed the empire by the emperor, which gives us flashback first person chapters for the bulk of the book, until the recounting of the past meets the present circumstances and we go forward from there, with the main character escaping and killing the emperor.

(Which kind of frame you use mostly depends on what you want from the story.)

I'd take note that the ending of the MC's story is already "known" in that he Kills a King, causes a Civil War, loses his hypercompetence, and becomes a broken old innkeeper at the start of the novel (no spoilers required.) So, some would argue that the genius of the story stems from the fact that you know his comeuppance will arrive... and most likely at the time that's worst, so he completely breaks... but hopefully the retelling of his narrative is what gives him the strength to recover and repair what he broke in the world and ultimately, himself.

******* Adding to alexanderwales' idea of using a framing device, I'd also recommend interludes where we jump to the viewpoint of another character to give an alternate perspective on a situation or to show something else that happened at the same time in the background.

To combine this with the framing idea, you could have the interlude be something what the main character found out from a friend at some point in the vague future or have the person that the main character is telling the story to, say that they heard from a friend of a friend this scene also occurred.

*** A good device for large-scale first person narratives, is to give the character herself a reason to tell the story to somebody (ideally somebody as ignorant about the world as we readers are) well after the story itself has happened.

That way she has reason to have researched other perspectives, and can insert other peoples' stories and opinions in addition to her own, providing backstory, world-building, character development /at the same time/.

Yeah that's the idea I was originally going with, but I'm finding its taking a lot more time and plot then I wanted getting her out of her hometown. What I wrote as the entire first book takes place in and around her hometown, and covers the events that lead her to actually set out.

Maybe though, I could compress those parts down significantly and also add in 'current' events, IE, what's happening to her while she's writing the journal. So the journal starts in her present, and each chapter talks about the present, backtracks a certain distance to cover past events, then comes back forward to return to the present?

That's true, if I write it in present tense with her talking about her current situation, then I can backtrack to describe all the incidents that make up her past as they apply to the present?

That's an interesting idea. I would essentially be taking the plot of the second book, and adding the plot of the first book into it as narrated backstory, skipping ahead in time to when things are actually interesting.

** Paranoia. When are you being paranoid, and when are they really out to get you?

Ok, so we've all seen movies and read books with both people who are too paranoid, not paranoid enough or just paranoid enough. What I ask is, in real life, which follows no overarching narrative (although, of course, there can be a variety of narrative-like structures IN life itself) when can you actually be certain there IS some bigger plot, as opposed to you just misinterpreting things and being "too paranoid"? When can you be sure that your mom asking about your new girlfriend isn't her way of subtly probing you because she found the condom you thought you'd lost last week? When do you know if your boss casually asking you to train someone isn't the preparatory steps towards you being fired, because he noticed you're tardy often but chooses to not address it and let it fester, so your firing is justified?

When can you know that someone is trying to play the long, manipulative game, even if every action they've taken so far seems fairly innocous? Is it possible at all?

Note the answer to the above questions, along with any times you were too paranoid, just paranoid enough or NOT paranoid enough, if you feel so inclined. :)

*** I spent some time as a younger man working as a college admissions counselor. Wealthy families would hire me to help their children prepare for tests like the SAT and write their college applications. Here's what you need to know, generally:

*0. Take classes that qualify you for admission to college*

Most colleges will require a minimum number of years in mathematics, social sciences, natural sciences, and language arts/literature for admission. Some will also require a specific level be reached in mathematics-- say, pre-calculus. Ideally, you take 4 years in each of those 4 subjects.

*1. Get good grades*

You need good grades to get into college. How good depends on the school. If you want to apply to an engineering school, you'll particularly want good grades in math and science courses. Ideally, you get mostly As, though Bs are fine. I got into the UCLA engineering school with 50% Bs, 50% As in my math/science courses, while taking honor roll courses 7 years ago.

*2. Do well on standardized tests*

Most schools require you either take the SAT or ACT to get in, and your scores matter a lot, almost as much as your grades. You may also be required to take subject-matter tests. Taking tests isn't a test of knowledge or expertise, it is a test of your ability to take tests. Test-taking is a skill that can be trained, and learning how to perform well on standardized tests is something that children in wealthy communities learn in school starting from 2nd or 3rd grade.

If your test scores are low, you should lay out some cash and enroll in cram school. My initial score on the SAT was an average of 700 on each section. I spent a couple of months going to the Princeton Review cram school in the evenings and at the end got an average of 770 on each section. At the time, there were 3 sections on the SAT worth 800 points each, so I went from 2100 to 2310.

This cram school was very expensive-- I think in total it cost about 2 grand with materials, tuition, etc-- but it was worth it. I have the kind of mind and set of study habits that reacted well to cram school. All the lectures and homework and flashcards worked well, and because I wasn't stressed out by existing schoolwork, the extra work didn't overload me. Bear in mind that if you end up crushing yourself under extra work this could be counterproductive.

Either way, though, buy a book and study for your standardized tests. The system is meant to be gamed, to be beaten by studying for these things. They're designed to be difficult to study for, but it can be done.

*3. Apply to at least one school you are sure you will get into, and like*

So, the most important school you apply to is the one you're absolutely sure you'll get into. This school WILL be an option for you, so pick it wisely. People call it a “safety” school because applying to it gives you a “safe” option. Many people end up attending their safety school, so pick it wisely! If your safety school is a place you don't actually want to go, you're putting yourself in a bad situation.

*4. Do all of the above, and more, if you're applying to a prestigious private school*

All the stuff above will get you into a great school. Get good grades, do well on your tests, and apply to a school you're sure you'll get into. If you want to go to an impacted school with tons of applicants, like Pomona College in California, or any of the Ivy League schools on the East Coast, or other similarly hard-to-get-into schools, you need to do more than just excel. These schools probably have 2-3x the number of fully qualified applicants they need. They will look at other things.

A friend of mine got into Pomona just based on his grades and SAT scores, but he had perfect grades in all honor roll classes, was fluent in three languages and didn't miss a single point in all of AP Physics. Most people trying to get in, though, are just very smart, not prodigies in every subject *shakes fist at Julien* so they'll need something else to distinguish themselves. Take part in extracurricular activities that push your boundaries. Sports are good--- the people I keep in touch with today from high school aren't the people I met through class, but the ones I met through athletics. You make new friends and have new experiences. But generally, just find something fun that lets you do something cool. It'll give you something to write an essay about, I guess.

I got into a few prestigious private schools, but nothing like Yale or Harvard. My clients typically weren't the sort who were aiming for this kind of thing, so I can just tell you what I saw success with. Ultimately, with this kind of thing, something that makes you stand out is good. They MUST throw away qualified applicants, so you're trying to beat people who are just as smart, or smarter than you. You gotta play the game; you gotta sell it.

*The Interviews and Essays*

I am good at interviews so I can't offer much knowledge. Whereas my companions trained themselves to talk to adults in positions of power, interviewing came naturally to me. I don't know what holes you'll have in this. “Be yourself” is shit advice unless “yourself” is someone who is comfortable with these things. In any case, these interviews, when conducted by alumni, are pretty low key and not about weeding people out. It's a conversation about the school and about yourself. Bring some stories or some anecdotes. Think about the stories your parents tell when they have new friends over for dinner, the kind of stories they tell to create closeness and companionship. Fashion your own versions of these stories, drawn from your own life experiences. If you can make it so your interviewer had fun and likes you as a person at the end, it doesn't matter.

Essays: You can go anywhere with this. I wrote an essay that was a poem, I wrote an essay that was a short science fiction piece about a city dying (trains would come empty, and leave with people--- the air is red in the sunset, beautiful and cancerous. The protagonist smokes, and why not? It's not like the air is clean anyways). I wrote an essay about how I fixed a DDR stomp pad when applying to an engineering school. I wrote an essay about how I always wanted to attend Brown University and accidentally sent it to University of Maryland. They let me in anyways, and into the honor school at that. Hah. I wrote an essay about love lost, even though I hadn't had my first breakup. I wrote an essay about a friend who died in a car accident, though he was more an acquaintance than a friend.

The essay should itself be beautiful, should be interesting to read. It should be anecdotal, and broad in scope only in what is revealed. Start as close to the end as possible, as my boy Kurt V would say. Want to talk about your obsession with viola? Don't write about your freshman year, then your sophomore year, etc. No, write about your Junior year, when you audition for your state band--- the previous years will be implied. Don't talk about how you got the scars, just talk about pouring isopropyl alcohol over your calloused hands after a long practice in preparation for the audition. Don't say you are afraid, say your heart is hammering in your chest. And don't tell this is a culmination of your ideals and work, proof you can succeed: show it. Don't tell them you bleed, bleed. Don't tell them you suffer: suffer. And at the end, they will understand.

The essay should be, on the surface, about a singular event. Anyone reading it should get the understanding of who you have been for the past years, and who you will be.

*** Pro tip: Take standardized tests as soon as possible, and then every year. I took the SAT and ACT beginning as a freshman in high school, and went from a 1480 to 1600 on the SAT (old scale max) and 31, 34, 35 (out of 36) on the ACT. I didn't do any preparation other than filling out their free example booklets. Taking them early allows you to get used to the test environment and the pattern of the questions. Taking them senior year only is for chumps.

** What are your favorite map projections?

- Rectangular, elliptical, or in some other shape?

- Conformal, equal-area, or compromise?

I generally prefer [[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjNav/projNav.html#Mercator][Mercator]] (rectangular conformal) and [[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjConf/projConf.html#classicConformal][Lagrange]] (elliptical/irregular conformal). I'm also tickled by [[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjAz/projAz.html#Gnomonic][the gnomonic projection]], especially when it's combined with a polyhedral layout so that it can actually cover the entire globe.

*** For some reason, I was instantly reminded of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/8chan/comments/3fajrv/a_sociopath_visits_r9k/][this incident,]] and I went to your post history to check if you were the one who was doing that. I remain entertained.

The only projection I have an opinion on is the plate carrée, or the lat/long equirectangular projection, because that's the projection NASA provides for [[http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_cat.php?categoryID=1484][Earth]] and the [[https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=3895][Deep Star Map]], for simple uv-projection and rendering.

I think I may like the near-side perspective view too, because space.

If you're implying that I was trolling, I wasn't. (Also, you're supposed to use =http://np.reddit.com= links when linking between parts of this site. Tut, tut!)

On-topic: (makes moue of disappointment) But [[http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjCyl/projCyl.html#Rectangular][the equirectangular projection]] is so /boring!/ I mean, really, what could be more plain than a simple faux-compromise projection that uses literally /no/ equations at all and has zero special properties to boot? :-(

That is not a site rule nor a subreddit rule, and it's a fairly stupid convention. NP is for nepalese. In addition, we're a niche community, so brigading is not an issue for us.

Not true either. Simple mapping from rectangle to sphere. 180° by 360° equals beautiful skysphere. <3

*** I dislike Mercator just for the baggage it now carries and the inaccuracy of geographic intuition it promotes - the projection itself is actually very useful for some purposes. For most of the maps I'm making it's not an issue, or I use equal-area cylindrical over the Australasian region.

My favourite map projection is a digitally-displayed perspective of the geoid, with interactive data layers. If I could just work out how to embed a pointcloud in Google Earth, I would be /so happy/.

** I'm looking for some physics babble that passes the [[/r/rational]] crowd's smell test. More specifically, I'm looking for numerology that's related to the number 10^{120.}

I'm positing that the Vacuum Catastrophe is because there are roughly 10^{120} parallel universes. There have been around 8e60 Planck times since the Big Bang, which is half of the exponent I'm looking for. There don't seem to be too many other relevant sources for another 10^{60} exponent, and I can't think of a reason to square the number I've got... Any suggestions?

*** There are 10^{80} atoms in the observable universe. You could probably fudge that down to an average of10^{60} for each Planck time over the life of the observable universe, as it was smaller at the start.
