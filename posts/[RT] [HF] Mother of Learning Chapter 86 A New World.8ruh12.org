*** Can confirm! Discovered this on Friday night, and just caught up. This was a relatively nice place to be left off.

The only thing really worth noting from an archive reader perspective is after arc two everything really picked up in pace, which makes sense. Most of the mundane is gone, which made me slightly worried about the ending. Having the revisit here and in the post-soul damage reset really help the story flow better and eased my fears.

** 18 restarts left

things still to do this loop:

- find the staff

- acquire pet hydra

- study hydra further to learn how to synchronize himself with his simulacrums

- study how to fake the marker

- contact 2 other pocket dimension mages that QI told them about

- more study of blood magic and enhancement rituals to assist in learning dimensional magic (especially for Zach)

- learn soul magic from QI (were the cranium rats able to report that Zorian was killing them? If so, I don't know how they can approach him for lessons)

- another vault robbery with QI (again, iffy. also don't try to kill him this time?)

- explanation of what he pulled out of QI's memories

- utilize black room to increase their study time for dimensional/soul/blood magic

- try new tactics to get ring (ally with other tribe to draw them out)

- get Kael governmental support

surprised he took Kirielle, not sure what they're going to do with her while gallivanting across the world

Enough emphasis on Fortov that you suspect something is going to happen there ("He's useless and I don't like him." - no way that can backfire)

*** I like how a lot of insanely difficult things are mentioned as a one sentence throw-away. Bits and pieces that used to be the focus of a chapter are now paragraphs. I wonder if they can eventually reduce this entire list down to a single paragraph of 'oh, then we broke the world over our knee so it'd listen to us'?

Hell, even the reactions of other people to the loop are great. Taiven's fussing over Zorian's arm, Ilsa's concerned about Zorian's mental state (and ethical, I guess, because mind mage), Daimen is a little bit shocked at his brother being able to pull together an obscene amount of money. ZZ just look at all of this and go 'oh, my arm, well, next loop I'd better figure out how to touch my teacher with an obscenely powerful cosmic artefact so she can mass manufacture puppets for me' or 'Heh, that's funny. Let's go beat up my caretaker for stress relief.'.

The first time they told people about the loop, their reactions added a lot to the story. This is even better - it's not even 'real' character development, but it's a great way to illustrate how bizarre it all is.

*** yeah I really wonder where the narrative is going with Fortov. So far he is pretty flat; Zorian has this image of him as a good-for-nothing asshole, and the conversation between Fortov and Daimen just... kinda confirmed that.

I'm kind of considering the possibility that Fortov is RR now:

- RR "piggy-backing" off the time-loop and being an asshole fits with Fortov's character.
- If Fortov were RR, he would want to mostly avoid Zorian (Zorian might notice something is off). Indeed, Fortov and Zorian mostly avoid each other during the month. Fortov might literally never notice that Zorian was acting differently restart-to-restart. The only time they interact is when Fortov wants Zorian to make the rash potion; he might attribute Zorian's different reactions to minor variations. (That said, it's hard to see how he wouldn't notice that sometimes Zorian takes Kirielle, which is a big strike against this theory.)
- There's been a strange emphasis on how Fortov pushes Ibery into the bush with striking regularity. Why could this be? If Fortov were RR, he would try to act mostly the same in every restart. He might overcompensate, say, by always acting /exactly/ the same way.
- Zorian has no idea what Fortov does during the invasion. He has never seen Fortov during the invasion once, and I think someone drew attention to this at some point.
- The difference in train car occupancy (near the end of Book 1) could be caused by Fortov doing something different.

On the other hand:

- No reason Fortov would be connected to Veyers.
- No reason Fortov would want the invasion to succeed.
- When is he spending all his time getting more powerful, if he's acting like a student all the time?
- If Fortov were RR, why wouldn't he just wipe Zach's memories of Fortov and disappear? Is it because doing so would create too many ripples (e.g. through Zorian) and he wouldn't be able to change Zach's memory that much? ... maybe?
- Presumably RR needs to be an expert soul-mage to tamper with the temp-marker, or able to reach soul-magic proficiency in 6 restarts. It's really unlikely that Fortov is this, unless Fortov is a natural soul mage in the same way Zorian is a natural mind mage, or something. That's a complexity penalty (although I wouldn't feel cheated if this were suddenly revealed at the end).

I'd assign very low confidence to this theory, but it's not that unreasonable, I think.

Fortov could have done exactly what Zorian did to become a good soul mage, use his natural talent as a mind mage to mind-rape soul mages for their knowledge. We don't know if he's actually psychic or not, we just know that he's charming. In fact, we *very explicitly* don't know if he's psychic or not, since Zorian never took an interest in him.

[[/u/tjhance]] Fortov himself already explained that (tho you could think that's just an excuse, but unlikely). he was going for extreme measures since nothing else was working

****** yeah so I was trying to get as was something like the following: (i) Normally, Fortov pushes Ibery into the bush, for the reasons he describes (ii) if Fortov becomes RR, he continues to do so just b/c he did the first time and feels he need to be consistent

ummm but yeah, as you point out, he continues to overly-consistently do the bush incident, even after RR leaves (i think? zorian never says otherwise, but zorian doesn't do the normal school-route much after RR leaves), so yeah, it doesn't make any sense to say that his over-consistency is evidence of fortov=RR.

I mostly think fortov=RR is a funny theory, in the sense of the story saying "yeah, you didn't think RR was going to be someone close to zorian because obviously they would notice each other, but don't you remember how much zorian and fortov ignored each other?" I'm not putting any money on it.

But actually I dunno where else the story would be going with Fortov, other than a classic "brothers make up and learn to help each other" arc, which hasn't even begun yet

***** In the past I've discounted Fortov as a possibility of being red robe as I thought he had no possible direct link to Zach except through Zorian which means pre-Zorian entering the time loop it'd be unlikely for Fortov to find out that Zach is looping (I also discount people like Silverlake, and Zorian's parents for the same reason).

I find the possibility of Fortov being a natural mind mage and having somehow acquired some basic training in it super interesting because it provides a potential path for him to find out about Zach and so become red robe.

It still seems like a pretty big stretch but it makes him a bit more likely. If by leaving the loop Red Robe Fortov has been replaced with an oblivious copy then at least the natural mind mage ability is something testable to determine whether he has the potential to become red robe (unlike say Veyers who it's probably impossible to tell whether he's red robe).

For what it's worth here are my current possible red robe candidates:

- *Zach* - a rogue simularican, then mindwiped Zach's memory of the ability to create them and do mind magic. Requires some pretty hefty details like a simularican that's a (perfect?) clone of Zach's body that somehow gets his soul marker.
- *Veyers* - 'obvious red herring'
- *Spear of Resolve* - this one is pretty reachy, but with their crazy mind magic abilities they could easily have found out about Zach and used a random human pawn to do their bidding (a plus side is they don't even need to turn temporary markers into permanent ones - just copy a mind packet into your pawn and mind control the human into giving you the packet at the start of each restart. After 6 restarts, select a new pawn. Requires being able to get the Lich's crown every 6 restarts and a few other crazy things and the Zorian interactions don't make sense anymore (unless there was a human that somehow didn't return a mind packet so spear of resolve accidentally left the time loop for an unknown amount of time until Zorian stumbled into it).
- *Eldemar prince* - would be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing
- *Rat controller* - would probably be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing - could be shenanigans similar to the Spear of Resolve stuff. Rat controller seems to be QI, so it implies that in this case he probably did the pawn control type stuff that I said the spiders could do. One point towards this is that it seems super unlikely that the rats wouldn't find out about Zach at least some of the time. One point against is QI not seeming to be in on it when Zorian got bought into the loop.
- *Dragon cult member* - would be an 'unnamed' red robe - would be kind of disappointing
- *(now Fortov too)* - strange loop stability, something happens on the train, tenuous link to Zach

In picking Red Robe I'm assuming it'll be following the usual 'rationalist' literature theme of it being an actual solvable problem and also that it'll actually be a /good/ reveal which eliminates a bunch of minor possibilities that'd just be pretty dumb. Honestly I've reviewed every named character in Mother of Learning and I'm a bit stumped for answers that fit perfectly.

As a good thing.

I've always considered people who aren't in the story until red robe is gone to be very unlikely for narrative reason but your logic makes a lot of sense.

I had listed Sudomir as 'no real reason to suspect' just because I didn't think he really had a good direct connection to Zach, but I suppose he was reasonably likely to interact with him when Zach is messing with invasino stuff.

Mostly I agree that he's not really an interesting character and wouldn't be a very satisfying answer. He'd basically be someone that'd fit the 'random cult of the dragon below' bullet I had listed. I wouldn't be surprised if the real read robe used QI's and/or Sudomir's knowledge to turn the temporary marker permanent though.

RR was to busy to play with ZZ and any interest the showed would have given zorian away.

********* Yeah I totally agree that it works well from a logical perspective. It just means that there's no way for the reader to have a hope of figuring out who read robe is at chapter 39 when he leaves the loop so it doesn't work so well from a narrative perspective.

Some people (like Veyers) were mentioned once or twice in passing which is a little better.

I guess ideally with a known character there could be some subtle clues based on them acting differently after red robe leaves the loop.

****** What about Tesen Zveri, Zack's caretaker? He has an obvious connection to Zack and the Noveda family, he is a powerful mage, he cheated Zack out of his inheritance and seems shady in general, and he is responsible for donating the Sovereign Gate to the Crown. It's possible that he has special knowledge about the Gate and he might even be connected to starting the time loop in the first place. In that case, he would be in a good position to become Red Robe.

On the other hand, it's strange that he would allow himself to be beaten and humiliated by Zack repeatedly (which happened before Red Robe left the loop). But we only know that indirectly, and I don't think Zorian ever met him when Red Robe was still in the time loop.

Is there anything in the story that obviously exonerates him? Or maybe more hints that he is Red Robe? Couldn't find anything.

(Related: What about the two researchers in the time magic facility? Did Zack interact with the Sovereign Gate in the real world to start the time loop? If yes, they may have been there.)

******* That is true. I guess the only thing I could add is that Tesen wouldn't really be a very satisfying answer.

I've been wondering for a while if there are any hints in the story about how Zach got in the time loop. I certainly haven't found anything concerete. Tesen is one of the more likely people to have initiated it if Zach was inserted as a necessary pawn because of his heritage or something (which is pretty likely). I think the story implies that the sovereign gate ended up with the Eldemar because of Tesen selling off all of the Noveda belongings but maybe it was on purpose...

I've been leaning towards the gate turning on 1 month early being some sort of divine failsafe because of the imminent primordial summoning (and sucking Zach in because of his heritage) but there isn't any hard evidence for that either.

In terms of the researchers (Krantin Keklos and Aread) , they're first introduced in Chapter 54 and they're only ever mentioned by name in that chapter. Seems super unlikely that they'd be anything bit bit characters for narrative reasons but it's possible.

Even Damien pointed out that even if you accounted for the years spent in the time loop, Zorian is only a couple years younger than him. However, he has had practically exponential growth in nearly all magical fields. I think Ilsa is also starting to take notice that Zorian isn't an average mage. Even taking into perspective the extra time and resources an "average" mage wouldn't be able to accomplish what Zorian has.

Zach had decades before zorian, and he had some mad combat skills but was otherwise a pretty useless mage. Even Zach, since zorian got on board, improved exponentially. And the only reason he learns SOME things faster than zorian, is he has a magnitude larger pool of mana to draw from.

It's pretty clear that improved mental state zorian is a pretty highly talented mage

It is never specified how old she is exactly, but she /is/ immortal.

Her problem is just that her current immortality is somewhat defective: Although her lifespan is now indefinite, her body is still that of an old woman, so she suffers various symptoms of old age like wrinkles, random aches, etc. Nothing that would kill her, but annoying nonetheless. She is working on a potion that allows her to regain her youth so she doesn't have to endure all these old age ailments anymore.

I completely agree! Many of the chapters where we learn more about Taiven, Xvim, Kael, Ilsa, or others are fantastic.

But we didn't really learn anything new this chapter. If this was a sitcom or anime, this chapter would be the equivalent of a flashback episode. Every section was essentially a recap.

Ilsa's huge section felt nearly identical to the earlier train rides with Kirielle, just with a couple interjections of things we already knew. Unlike when Taiven or Xvim first started believing in the loop, her reactions just didn't feel right.

Daimen's section, which made up most of the rest, was even worse in that regard.

We learned that Z&Z are planning to take other people out of the loop with them, and that they're mounting a new expedition. That's about it.

If MoL was released as a book, I doubt anyone would really notice, but when it's released chapter by chapter, it hits a little harder. You have weeks of built up anticipation for each chapter, and they don't all measure up the same. Especially with the level of hype other, more interesting chapters have created.

I think people were hoping to see people interacting with others they hadn't really talked to before, conducting raids, or even just sharing new backstories. The fact that people can develop inside the loop was exciting.

****** well, it's more like a transition chapter than a filler chapter. It's not supposed to describe them believing the loop so much, but their curiosity now about the implications of the loop and their temporary ability to gain from it.

And yes, it feels similar to every other ride with Kirielle - this portrays how everyone has an immediate desire to satisfy Questions about the situation, but such discussions are limited by the need to preserve the quasi-secret nature of their situation within public contexts.

I'm sure we'll get to people conducting efforts with new allies, but we barely knew who was receiving markers before, and spending some time with their concerns about being included also signals to us that they aren't viewed as tools by Z&Z, as explicitly described in the chapter as well.

Can't really say I had a handle on Damien's personality to expect something specific from him, and I think interactions with Ilsa were meant to be representative for all the people they don't have close relationships with. These people are now going to have to start 'opening up' but are understandably somewhat wary at first and spend more time initially observing Z& Z to see the effect /implications of the loop.

** Hmm? Now that I think about it, the temporary marker mechanism is really strange. At first, I thought the marker's degradation or removal would permanently scar the target's soul in some way, making it impossible to mark them again in the same restart. But since everyone without a working marker gets a new soul in the next restart (thus losing all their magic growth and memories), their souls should be markable again in the next restart.

Yet now we're told that it is impossible to mark a target again for 12 restarts. So some other mechanism has to be keeping count for those 12 restarts, and it can't be a part of the target's soul since their souls get replaced every restart...

Simply have the crown record 3 values into Gate mechanism for each marked souls: ID of soul to be pulled back, countdown until that soul stop being pulled back, and countdown until this record erased from Gate mechanism (so that new record can be made without any conflict).

This require the Gate to have an instruction layer to be executed before each start of a loop. But this is already present as Gate already have record of controller ID, what's inside the orb, what souls' ID to not be recreated, so on and so forth.

But it doesn't! The fact that Zorian is in the loop strongly sugggests that the Gate just looks for markers, and does not actually record which souls have markers. After all, Zorian joined the loop via a botched soul magic spell on him and Zach, which transferred a piece of Zach's marker onto Zorian. If the Gate had any kind of record used to confirm who the controller is before allowing the controller to keep his soul in the next restart, it wouldn't have let Zorian join in. And if the Gate doesn't even record who has the permanent marker(s), why would it record who has temporary markers?

But now that I think about it, that oddity can be explained by Red Robe. We know that Red Robe has messed with the Gate's mechanisms somehow, tricking the Gate Guardian into thinking that he is the controller and allowing him to leave. It is possible that Red Robe simply disabled all the security measures that the Gate had for permanent markers (without bothering about the temporary markers), and thus unintentionally allowed Zorian to join the loop.

***** Your solution is basically the same as mine; store an information. The problem is, where is this information got to be stored? I proposed a new layer of instruction on top of the template, but later I was shown that controller marker and other artifacts can work without it. This imply a rule that information can only be stored by either marking the soul or by directly tamper the template.

By the implied rule, storing crown information on soul should deny 12 turn cooldown period, because you will get pristine soul after the temp marker run out or revoked. Storing crown information on template should deny recreation of pristine soul.

Also, /rule of fun/ stated that you can still enjoy a work even if you don't exactly know the nitty gritty of why things go certain way. But this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]], where future reveal must not invalidate rule established beforehand. This 12 turn cooldown rule invalidated the implied rule.

My understanding is that there's three ways out of the time loop: either you trick the Sovereign Gate Guardian into thinking you are the controller and ask him to let you leave, you use the 5 keys to force the controller to let you leave, or you open up an a tunnel through a primordial cage from inside the time loop to the outside.

If the last method is used, anyone can leave the time loop, regardless of skill, since they just need to walk through the tunnel. There just needs to be some skilled mages "carrying" the party, maintaining the tunnel and casting spells to prevent whatever primordial is in the cage from killing them all.

They do? How would that work? When they exit the time loop, they have to deal with the Invasion of Cyoria by QI, the soul trap of Sudomir, the Cult of the Dragon Below and its connections to the Mage Guild, possibly the Primordial they unleash, and worst of all: Red Robe, who has gone through tons of loop iterations without having his mind messed with like Zach, and will help out all of the above enemies.

If they do nothing, the Primordial is almost certainly going to be unleashed and wreck havoc on the entire continent. And it will never stop or go away on its own because it isn't a spiritual summon. The only way to stop that is to go fight all the enemies, which seems impossible to do so while remaining low key. They aren't going to have any privacy unless everyone dies or Zorian forcefully regains their privacy by mind wiping everyone.

I don't see what the big deal is. They don't have to live in anonymity or hiding. The duplicates are just like having finding a long lost identical twin.

While it may cause some difficulties adjusting to life with duplicates, it's a minor issue compared to the invasion of Cyoria.

I think it's supposed to be "gave", but after reading it another couple of times both versions might work?

  They once again achieved their goal, successfully fought their way out of the capital city and then kept running from the Eldemar military until Quatach-Ichl figured out the nature tracking device that was used to track them.
#+end_quote

nature tracking device -> nature of the tracking device

--------------

#+begin_quote
  As an endless barrage of incinerating rays, impossibly sharp dimensional blades and disintegration blasts suddenly rained down on his, he quietly blocked, dodged, teleported and retaliated in return.
#+end_quote

on his -> on him

--------------

in advanced activate -> in advance activated

  And finally, a small number was special.
#+end_quote

was -> were

--------------

#+begin_quote
  For a moment, the whole battlefield stilled. Quatach-Ichl was momentarily frozen in place, a look surprise on his face.
#+end_quote

a look surprise -> a look of surprise

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Zach and Zorian waiting with baited breaths to see if the lich would collapse into a lifeless pile of bones in the aftermath.

#+begin_quote
  "We will hopefully gather the entire Key before all six restarts run out, at which point we will be able to unblock the exit," Zorian said. "If we have an exit method *also* ready by then, we might be able to just get you out of the time loop at that point. At which point it doesn't really matter *than* your marker will run out."
#+end_quote

(Subjective) Unnatural placement for the "also".

than your marker -> that your marker

** I don't know if it's allowed but I'll ask anyway.

I started reading Mother of Learning way back, maybe 4 years ago maybe and I stopped. I would like if someone here remember the chapter where Zorian first learned he's an empath. I remember something about a mansion burning and the spiders coming to help but I forgot. I would like to start reading again.

** I'm kind of surprised that he hasn't picked up the pace in releases a bit. 3 weeks is, like, little side hobby pacing.

The reason this seems odd to me is that his patreon shows him as having an income from each MoL chapter comparable to the average monthly wage for workers in Croatia. If he can get that much from each chapter, it seems like the logical thing to do would be to make this his full-time job and up the speed, and thus his income. It's what Zorian would do!
