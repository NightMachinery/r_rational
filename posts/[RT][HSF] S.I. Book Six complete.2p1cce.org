** I started writing this thing in the beginning of June. I've been going for six months, have written 272,000 words... and my protagonist /still/ hasn't even learned of any of the real powers of the setting, let alone met them. But I think she's starting to get closer to that point. :)

** Awesome! I've been reading through the Google Docs and it's really good and well-written. I wouldn't say that your plot is taking too long to get anywhere, but rather you have such a detailed and involved world with fascinating characters who all demand their 15 minutes (or more!) of the spotlight.

Are you planning on trying to get this published? I would definitely buy it (preferably as an e-book). Although I get that sense you aren't going to, otherwise why would you make a [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/][website]] for it?

There are multiple reasons why this book is never going to go through any of the traditional publishing houses. My current thoughts are that, once I finish, I'll probably make it available in chapterized form on my website, and a "Pay What You Want" tipjar mechanism for a nicely formatted ebook. (Said thoughts are open to being changed between now and then.)

**** By the way, I didn't notice this earlier because I usually read from the Google Docs, but why does your website have only the first chapter up when you have six books of material?

Also what is the significance of the syllables by each book number? The ones like Book One: Re, Book Two: In, Book Three: Ex,....

Laziness, mainly. I put the first chapter up while experimenting with how to format the text, and the site's general layout; but just haven't gotten around to converting the rest of the text into individual chapter-pages. One kind soul created a shell-script to run some regex on the plaintext that I write in and convert it into HTML that matches that sample chapter, with curly quotes and em-dashes and so forth; and it wouldn't take /too/ much effort to adapt the first chapter's header and footer into a template to copy-and-paste the converted text into... but I've been focusing on other things, such as writing the story itself.

When I started writing, I thought I'd end up with something like a novella, and starting each chapter with 'Re' seemed like a decent way to reference Bunny's recycling and rebirth and renewal and all that jazz. By the time I figured out that the story would be at least three 'books' long, it seemed easier to adapt the system with a new prefix per book, then to try to come up with thirty chapter titles all starting with 're-'. If you squint hard enough, then each Book's prefix could be viewed as the theme for that book, but I haven't felt a need to let that tightly constrain what I can write.
