Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** *Are slow!Zombies actually really fast?*

So I've been thinking about zombie hoards recently. They turn up in fantasy quite a lot - shambling armies of uncountable corpses that kill not through skill or even often strength, but shear weight of numbers. One of the defining traits of these types of zombies is that they are slow - often moving at little more than a walk (as opposed to the fast, animalistic zombies often seen in some modern zombie films).

Let's say a zombie can move at 3mph, about human walking speed. On that battlefield that means skirmishers and well drilled regular infantry should be able to keep well ahead of them. A light jog would be enough.

But the tactical map isn't the only thing we need to consider. The strategic is also vital and it is here that I think slow!zombies become fast.

Why? Your typical fantasy zombie doesn't tire. It doesn't need a supply train. It can march through storm, hail, sleet and good weather without stopping. It can march day and night. It can ford some rivers and maybe even march under water.

3mph for 24 hours is over 70 miles a day. That's insane for non-mechanised infantry. Even if terrain means that can't be in a straight line, they are going to be out marching any mundane force a fantasy kingdom can field.

Do the zombies break through your lines to ravage your inner kingdom? Better catch them within a day otherwise you aren't catching them. They're going to out-march anything you send to catch then.

Zombies and your re-enforcements heading to the same place? Better hope its very close or they are beating you there. And worse, you're forces are going to be dead on their feet after such a forced march, while the zombies will be as fresh as ever (:>).

The "classic zombie" surely needs a certain amount of flesh and/or brains to keep shambling. They might be really fast for a few days or even weeks, but you're not looking at an undead horde of Wandering Jews.

Also, with the standard medieval fantasy tech base, I don't think zombie treadmills are really going to compete with your standard water wheel or wind mill for power generation. Sure you don't have to feed the zombie, but you do have to feed the full time guards and handlers that are necessary to keep such an operation running.

*** I really like this. I think that due to just how shambleing zombies are they might not be able to march though some areas that humans could. So maybe all the kingdoms of the central plain are run by the necromance overlords and the mountainous regons are where the forces of good live.

**** What if to function the zombies had to stay within a certain distance of a necromancer? That makes underwater geography very important. Zombies could march right through a shallow sea (where a necromancer on a boat would still be able to control zombies marching on the sea bed) and assault coastal communities but deep seas and trenches would block such assaults.

** I'm sketching out the details for a new worldbuilding project that will never be used for anything serious, and would like some feedback/thoughts/help with it.

--------------

As a result of incredibly fast plant growth, the world has a stark contrast between the wilderness and the places where people live. Typically speaking, cities are built where soil has been permanently made so poor (via salting or otherwise) that plants can't grow, and even then, it's a constant struggle against the plantlife, which is always threatening to swallow up houses and cities by creeping in.

The thing that I like about this kind of threat is that it's both gentle and ever-present, in a claustrophobic, suffocating way. You can go between cities or towns fairly easily, even if it takes a bit longer because there are fewer roads (with roads being difficult to maintain). And there should be lots of lost ruins that have been swallowed up.

I have a few questions that need to be answered before I can do more work though:

1. Where does the biomass come from? Most Earth plants get their mass by breathing (CO2 -> O2 leaves you with an extra C), so are these plants just breathing a lot faster and more efficiently to justify that growth?
2. How fast should growth be in order for it to be a continuous threat that any city has to constantly deal with on a daily basis?
3. Given that growth, what do the places that are totally unchecked look like? What /should/ they look like if I'm trying to make the most compelling setting? Trees that just keep growing, a foot every week, until they're so tall they fall over?

I'm mostly looking for some help making the foundation of the setting solid enough that I can do some of the more fun extrapolations on it, including the big set pieces. There will probably be some magic systems related to the growth in one way or another, but they're on hold until next week.

If magic exists, it provides enough energy for plants to grow even when they'd otherwise be covered.

In any case, you could have this planet be significantly wetter, so that plants have a lot more water to absorb.

At least as fast as kudzu. Though the growth itself doesn't actually have to be that fast, if there are other aspects to the plants that make them inimical to structures. (i.e., these plants are evolutionarily adapted to tear apart stone, cement, or just about anything except pure metal.)

The tree cover of a tropical rainforest, but with a ground level as densely packed with plants as a mangrove maybe.

*** 1. You will need increased CO2, but that won't be enough by itself to turn plant growth into a continuous threat. You'd also need increased rainfall, increased sunshine, a longer growing season, improved soil nutrients, and probably some degree of genetic engineering to make the plants grow at an alarming rate. You might also consider some kind of air-deposited biomass, perhaps an abundance of pollen, which would have a tendency to clump up, decay, and form soil on top of buildings which then supports the growth of plants that sink their roots into the structures.

2. Roughly 50x growth rates would be about the minimum to create a real problem. A tiny bamboo sapling would grow 1.5 to 5 meters over the course of a day, potentially making open fields inaccessible within 24 hours. Kudzu could spread 50 meters across the surface and have its roots go down 1.5 meters in a day, and it would probably cost the US about $50 billion per year to control its growth. Most trees would grow 50-100 feet per year.

3. Unchecked areas are basically going to look like old-growth rainforests, except that it'll happen very quickly.

Could come from CO2. Could come from some special mineral in the ground that the plants could mix with something else(O2?) to expand it. It could also come from a symbiotic relationship with some underground creatures who then feasted on the roots. I only know a little biology but I imagine that a lot of biomass is still water so you'd have to take into account where the water comes from. Does the earth itself naturally soak water from the sea/underground rivers and transport it up? Does it rain a lot? Does the plants such water out of the atmosphere(In which case you'd expect heavy tree places to be somewhat dry)

Grass grows with about 4 inches a month. A 10 year old kid is about 50 inches. If grass grew at x200 speed it would be taller than said kid in two days and you would have to cut it down every day or your kid would wander the streets blind. If it grew at x50(6.7 inches/day) you'd have to cut it down at least once a week to keep it below 50 inches which still is really labour intensive. It'll depend on where you are seeing the threats coming from(i.e. if poisonous plants grow at 6 inches a day you'd be really screwed) and how intensive we are talking.

Assuming water wasn't a concern the primarily initial limiter would be sunlight. As such I would predict that plants would take one of two strategies. Strategy A includes aggressively pursuing sunlight and we would see plants either growing really tall or to somehow piggyback on the tall plants to get sunlight, such as growing on tall trees. The majority of strat A users would be the tall ones as they would have evolved first and we would expect them to have really thicc roots and have massive trunks to support the weight and to sustain through wind and weather. Seedling of tall trees would need to have a lot of energy stored for their initial growth until they can get to sunlight. The tallest plants wouldn't have to optimize for sunlight effenciency so would let a bunch of sunlight through but the medium height plants would have to use the residual sunlight well which would leave the bottom with little natural sunlight.

Strategy B involves accepting losing the sunlight race and get energy from other places. Some plants would be parasite plants that stole energy from the other plants. Some might eat insects or small animals. Lastly, and honestly most interestingly, some plants might learn to survive on unnatural light. In our world there is something like 80 bioluminescent fungus and while we don't why these plants waste energy like that, it's plausible that it's a byproduct of producing energy through non-sunlight processes. I think it could be cool to explore this idea, if other plants evolved to accept this as their light source you could end up with a really appealing undergrowth, including symbiotic relationships with plants that would somehow protect said fungus in exchange for light.

For wildlife I would expect a lot of diversity. With a lot of biomass I would expect some animals to be rather big though the thick roots would require a certain agility to jump around, over and such. I can imagine animals that lives best at certain altitudes and that jumped between different trees without ever touching ground.

** lets start with real things in science today, shall we?

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97t7Xj_iBv0&feature=youtu.be][flexible titanium machines]] and [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130903091034.htm][artificial muscle]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_Compact_Fusion_Reactor][fusion]]

now, lets consider those technologies maturing a bit. to me, that looks like actuators and myomer for a battlemech. but it also has an impact on computing, being able to make very small parts in circuits. add a VR helmet and a fusion power supply... and we can start looking at a new type of machines.

a lot of people complain about the PSI of a mechs feet, so how many legs does our new machine need? or could we expect to be able to use flexible tentacles instead? the main downside of tentacles would probably be the complexity of the controlls, followed by the inherent problems with complex mechanical design.

then we get to the point where people have large robot vehicles... and then stick guns and armor on them. the question is not if its practical, it will be for some jobs. instead, we should ask what would it be best at? what niche would this sort of tech actually fill? a self-propelled fusion reactor with multiple appendages.

battletech was the 1980's view of the future with robots. what should the 2020 view of the future look like?

*** Mechs are basically super-infantry.

If your goal is to destroy some fixed target, you'd use artillery or airstrikes. Infantry becomes necessary when you want to occupy a city.

So, I'd I wanted to do future mechs, I'd write a story where they occupy an especially hard-to-hold city. Then the questions are: Why not non-mech soldiers? And why not mechanized cavalry?

One sci-fi option would be to put the setting in some shallow water. Projectiles become less effective, and mech suits with swords before slightly plausible.

A less sci-fi option would be focusing on the human aspect. Human scale mechs looks more human than tanks. So maybe they're less offensive to the locals. From there, I'd write a premise where there's an especially brutal insurgency and a civilian population who's right on the brink of revolt/collapse. Main characters need to be able to rapidly respond to attacks on infrastructure, without creating a bunch of collateral damage.

If I wanted to go full (slightly fucked-up) anime, give the mechs some bulletproof glass face-masks and have the pilots be smallish women.

**** Gundam's rationale for large robots was many-fold:

- because of Active Mass Balance And Control tech --- basically, having limbs --- the mechs were more maneuverable than similarly sized spacecraft with fixed configurations of mass, and could adjust position without spending propellant
- humanoid body plans provide more intuitive control for pilots than fins or thrusters
- humanoid body plans already have a number of established weapon design schemes, which only need to be scaled to fit the mech.

In the main timeline of the Universal Century, the state of the art design did tend back towards expendable munitions under psychic control, called "bits"
