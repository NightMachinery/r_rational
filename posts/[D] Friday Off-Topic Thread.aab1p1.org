Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I don't understand dating.

I've met someone on a dating site three days ago, and we get along like I've known her my entire life, despite being from different countries, having different pop-culture preferences, different hobbies and interests, different religions, and basically difference tastes in everything.

I have no idea what's happening.

*** Are they attractive? That helps.

But seriously, getting along with people is weird. So long as you don't actively disagree with each other, humans tend to form pretty strong empathetic bonds. This is more noticeable with platonic same-sex relationships - I distinctly remember my college orientation, where two girls in the orientation group were thicker than thieves after maybe five minutes of conversation. All it takes is actually talking and engaging with the other person. The exoticism may make them /different/, but notably, it does not make them an enemy. In that sense, you have a shared lack of understanding, rather than shared antipathy, so you can both commiserate about how strange it is that you get along without even liking the same things.

A more pessimistic person would call this an illusion, or a shallow friendship. That's dumb. Any friendship is going to be pressure sensitive, the only thing that makes an "instant friendship" more unstable than one made through common interests is that there's more unknown personality-space in each person that could potentially offend. You address that failure state the same way you would any other, with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem][pre-mortem]]:

The relationship has ended? What led to this?

1. (I/They) said something that (I/they) disagreed with, and was aggressive about it in a way that didn't suggest future peace.
2. (I/They) revealed a facet of personality through physical actions that (I/they) didn't initially model, which upset (me/them).
3. (I/They) took advantage of the trust that is implicit in most friendships.
4. Et cetera. If you want a good picture of what "ruining an implicit relationship" looks like, watch children's television. Most of the characters on, say, My Little Pony, are very diverse, and only really friends because of authorial intervention. This makes them structurally very similar to your situation - people with different backgrounds and philosophies being fast friends for no reason.

The solutions to these issues are simple. For the aggressive perspective, just /don't/ do things that would upset someone - don't abuse their trust, reveal a poorly aligned preference before they really know you, or be an ass about a disagreement. From the defensive perspective, practice conversations in your head. Try and imagine what it would be like if they did something to offend you and then try to go through the mental effort it would take to tolerate and forgive that offense. Once you've done that once, it won't take you nearly as long, or nearly as much effort, to do it again, should the situation arise.

As for building relationships like these: your first priority is to build a common ground for you to stand on. Find a new Youtube series you both like. Go on a date in a new place for both of you. And /aggressively/ try out things that they enjoy until you find one that you enjoy as well.

That's all that I can write that seems obvious to me. I hope it helps, and isn't as obvious to you. (or rather, I hope it is obvious to you and you didn't need the help, but that I largely matched your thoughts anyway)

*** What really brings people together is basically if they have the same problems - if they are in the same stage of life. Like what they ultimately want from the relationship. People tend to relate to mutual life problems and form a connection. Everything else tend to be superficial, just more various different quirks and qualities about that person that you just roll with. Sounds like you guys have great chemistry.

*** yeah, social interraction on the whole makes very little sense.

the fact that society is schizo in telling people to do things/not do things with so many contraditictions and so littel basis in actual reality makes something of a mess of it. hollywood (most media these days) presents a couple basic types of romance, usually dysfunctional at best, abusive at worst, usually played for laughs.

*** Are there any similarities between you two? Similar temperament, pace of life, habits? Maybe equivalent life philosophies?

Even if your upbringing and cultural backgrounds are different, similar enough personalities could compensate for all of this.

On the other hand- do you remember someone from a very familiar circle (think a fellow club member, a classmate you share interest with, etc.), that you didn't find a connection with?

*** People are a lot alike under the shell, but they rarely expose their soft underbellies to each other. Have you been talking about things that are parts of fundamental human experience, feelings, longings, formative family/friend experiences, what makes you really feel alive, et cetera? The lesson I've learned is that this is what makes up a lot of "connection," but that when people will share it with each other really is unpredictable.

** I've thought of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_game][hand game]], and I want [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s take on it. Also, suggestions on names.

My intention is to make a game for 3 or more people, is simple to understand, and can both accommodate straightforward play and high level strategy. Let me know what you think.

--------------

Rules

- Three or more people.
- The objective is to be the only person to place the highest number with one hand.
- If multiple people tied for the highest number, the next highest untied number wins.
- If there are only ties, the people who played the highest tied number are eliminated, and the game is repeated.

--------------

Strategy

Playing 5 is a high risk play, as someone else is likely to do so as well, and that will get you both out. On the other hand, people will know that, so no one might play it, which makes it viable. But people know that, as well. Hmm . . .

So your strategy is to predict your opponents' thoughts. Is she the kind of person to go for broke and play a high number, or to try to slip in unnoticed, play a low number and count on people fouling each other up? Also, what is she thinking i'm thinking she's thinking? What did he do last game, and will he repeat?

And so on.

-Possible Names(feel free to recommend more)

- Prince of the Hill, or just Prince
- Foul
- Gluttony
- Snowflake

*** High Tie?

Simple and on the nose, but the game where you throw either rock or paper or scissors is most commonly called Rock-Paper-Scissors, and the game where you try to get away with lying about dice is called Liar's Dice, the name is a description of a main aspect of the game a lot of the time.

*** They played a similar game with donuts on Taskmaster (a UK 'panel' show I highly recommend). Contestants have five donuts, and put some number of them on the peg, with ties canceling each other out. Of course, given that it's a game played by comedians, there are some more or less clever tactics, like eating a donut in full view of everyone else as a form of pre-commitment.

*** I've seen basically this game before, though typically it's flipped where the lowest positive integer untied wins, which allows for an unbounded number of players and potential winning numbers. Actually, it may have been played on this very subreddit, though I don't recall what they called it or when that was.

For a fixed number of players, there is definitely a unique mixed strategy equilibrium, where the most winningest number (5, in your version) is played with the highest probability, and some sort of decaying probability on the next few, which if you put forth the effort could probably be solved explicitly using standard Game Theory techniques, but will take a bit of effort, and would be different for each number of players.

**** Why does uniqueness follow? As far as I can tell there are several weak mixed Nash equilibria, e.g. for three players A-C: A plays 5, B plays 4, C plays 50% 5 and 50% 4.

There also is the symmetric solution you described, for three players it should be according to the ratio 1:1:2:4:8 from number 1 to 5.

I don't think there is something stable under cooperation and threats by groups of players, but not sure. Perhaps I'm not well-versed enough in game theory for that.

***** Yeah, I should definitely not have used the word "unique", though in my defense I didn't really consider asymmetric equilibria as being "realistic" I guess, particularly the one you described. Formally in game theory it is an equilibrium, but if you are presented with this game and put against people you don't know there's no reason to expect one to play only 5 and the other to play 50-50, so always playing 4 is probably not the best strategy. In real life, you can't actually expect your opponents to be perfectly rational, but symmetric, stable nash equilibria are still often decent choices regardless.

** Ted Chiang's been posted here a few times and people had done an amazing job of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4tjcld/q_im_trying_to_list_all_of_ted_chiangs_freely_and/][compiling his short stories]] online. Except, it looks like most of these links are now broken and the "Subterranean Press" magazine much of his things were posted in have stopped hosting his works? In particular "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling," as I haven't been able to find that in print. I've done some web searches and checked libgen, etc... Any suggestions on finding his works online?

On the plus side, it looks like next May he's [[https://www.amazon.com/Exhalation-Stories-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07GD46PQZ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1546012016&sr=8-3&keywords=ted+chiang][currently scheduled to release]] a collection of some of his works, including a couple new short stories. So that's exciting. I thought the online takedowns might be related to this, but for example "The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling" isn't in the new compilation...

** Last year I made [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7lhyo4/d_friday_offtopic_thread/drncnnt/?context=3][a list of resolutions]] for 2018. I was in somewhat of a "shoot for the moon" mindset, and so I included way more things than I expected to achieve. Since it's pointless to make these lists if you don't hold yourself to them, I figure I should revisit that list and tally up how many commitments I kept to:

- Learn about system administration and networking: I've got a job that touches on that field, but I have a bunch of subjects I thought I'd look into, and I haven't so far. No.

- Learn about machine learning: Nope, not really.

- Learn about package managers: I learned how to use pacman, which has done wonders do reduce my frustration whenever I need to re-install something or figure out what I've installed. Yes.

- Learn about sandboxing and alternate PM systems: Not really. I have a bunch of open tabs on my laptop about flatpack and other systems that have been taunting me since march. I figure I'll have time to look into them in january-february.

- Learn about computer graphics and modern UI: Ehhh, not really. I have leads, and I've discovered a lot of neat tools, but I haven't had the weeks of free time needed to really learn how to use these things.

- Learn about advanced programming language theory: Same thing, no time so far.

- Get a backup network up and running: In my head, I visualized it as "install a network on a bunch of computers and servers that I own". Only problem, I don't really own a bunch of computers and servers, and don't really want to. Oh well, pre-packaged solution it is.

- Release a playable, sellable version of The Tesseract Engine: Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah no.

- Participate in at least one Open-Source project: Yes! I made a large-ish PR for one of Atom's module that was merged, and featured as the main highlight of one of their releases. I'm ridiculously proud.

- Learn about and learn to use as many useful applications as I can: Eeeeeh, not really. I haven't really found the need, and everything I need is mostly already on my phone/computer.

- Work with a friend on one productive project per month: Ahahah, ahah, ah. :( :( :( Yeah, no. We ended up working on a frustrating three-months-long project that we burned out on. I need to stop starting video game projects with this guy.

- Keep exercising on a regular basis: Check, mostly, with some bumps in the road. I'm going to change my exercise regimen anyway.

- Practice parkour out of a gymnasium on a regular basis: Nope, I've only done it once this year. I'm not really at the level where I'm comfortable practicing outdoors.

My intention was to stick to about half of these commitments. A fairly optimistic tally gives me 5 successes and 8 failures, so I'm closer to a 40% success rate, which is in my dreaded "not bad but you could really do better if you tried" zone.

--------------

So, my new year resolutions for 2019 are:

- Learn about system administration and networking. Ask someone at my job how systemd and DNS servers and all these other names I keep hearing about work.

- Learn more about machine learning. At least set up a few neural networks and min-max systems.

- Learn about containerization and orchestration. That one's a bit of a cheat since I both have a student project and a professional project riding on it, but it'd still be nice to learn.

- Learn about computer graphics, and build at least one tool using glTF and Vulkan.

- Learn about Reactive UIs find a reactive UI framework compatible OpenGL / Vulkan apps.

- Learn about WebAsm and make at least a test program using a WebAsm plugin.

- Learn about advanced programming language theory. Write a new memory model for the D language. For ultimate extra credits, fork the D compiler and implement it.

- Finish and release the turn-based stealth game I'm currently working on.

- Participate in at least one Open-Source project. Candidates include: Atom again, Molecule, Dlang, Battle for Wesnoth,

- Work with a (different) friend on any productive project at all, at least one day per week. To be able to sustain this rythm, better manage my schedule, stick to low-stress jobs with flexible hours, and don't bite off more than I can chew.

- Write an edited version of TDWoD.

- Get politically implicated and either join a political party or a public debate commission. (might be /way/ too time-consuming, though)

- Stick to my new exercise regimen, which is push-ups and sit-ups twice a day every day, plus intense sport sessions twice a week (I already do parkour, I'm thinking 2 hours of climbing on saturdays).

- Stick to a morning diet of bread and jelly, as opposed to mild and industrial cereals.

Again, I'll be happy to stick to half of these commitments. I've stopped trying to get an unbroken streak of projects that would motivate me to keep pushing forward. I think that kind of commitment method doesn't really work for me. Instead I think in terms of getting the most done out of every week, which I thinks works a lot better for me.

I've tried setting myself up with a friend in peer-coding sessions, where I describe to him what I'm doing in real time, at least one day every week. It's really helped me stay motivated and productive, but it's also hard to arrange when outside circumstances make my schedule way too loaded to find time to work with him. I think that, in general, having periods of intense works is just terrible for my productivity, and I need to get into a rythm where I don't let work accumulate to the point where I fall back to bad habits. Having a job that accepts remote work and flexible hours is a big part of that.

Also, most of these things I will either get done during my months of entirely free time, or not at all. It's really hard to get motivated for in-depth research while working at a day job at the same time.
