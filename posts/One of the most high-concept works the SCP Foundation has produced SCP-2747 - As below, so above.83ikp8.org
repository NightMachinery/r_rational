** As near as I can tell, this seems to be some kind of metafictional entity that manifests inside fictional stories and then somehow nullifies said stories' existence, causing them to disappear from their "parent" world (the world which produced the stories in the first place). Also, apparently this thing is capable of, not only nullifying the stories /themselves/, but also stories /within/ stories, as well as stories within stories within stories, and so on. So it's essentially munching its way up a nested tower of fictional narratives, and the payoff is that because the /SCP universe/ is actually fictional, that suggests that they're also going to be erased--after which, of course, we're next in line.

If I'm right, then this is a pretty neat concept, but the horror relies pretty heavily on a couple of metaphysical assumptions that I don't share (such as, for example, the assumption that we live in a fictional universe). As such, I can appreciate this as a /concept/, but not really as /horror/.

*** Close. It postulates a particular self-destructing narrative: a set of characters and plot points that, if featured in a fictional work, destroys itself and the fictional work in question, erasing it from memories and reality. Appendix A provides clues regarding the nature of this narrative: it features a person or a group of people trying to reach or comprehend something black/evil/destructive, and failing despite expending great effort; sometimes featuring number seven.

The Foundation has been trying to map out fiction-space (by procedurally generating stories and descriptions of these stories, then checking whether there are any descriptions that don't correspond to any story) to figure out exact properties of this narrative, because it's an existential threat to their world (what if it plays out in reality?). ...And then it turns out results of their research are, [DATA LOST].

They have been unwittingly making this narrative play out in reality, being a group of people trying to comprehend a narrative-destroyer.

It doesn't necessarily. Nothing says the narrative /has/ to be fictional. We're observing its influence only on fictional narratives because there's more stories than realities, but it may very well work on real-world narratives (people and sequences of events) as well.

***** Because SCP Foundation is an organization whose goals are research and containment of various supernatural entities via mundane means, no matter how powerful or strange they are. There's a lot of overlap between [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s interests and the Foundation's:

- "Special Containment Procedures" are essentially our Munchkinry Threads. We like to come up with interesting ways to defeat dangerous opponents, and the Foundation has to.

- The objects themselves. We like esoteric and interesting things/entities, as long as they're self-consistent and well-explored. The SCP Wiki incentivizes people to generate original and unique objects, and the Foundation, by necessity or by choice, is a scientific institution; as the result, many good SCPs are both well-researched and novel.

- The bigger picture. The Foundation indeed exists in a rather hostile universe --- how do they deal with it? The Foundation has to do a lot of deontologically evil things to continue operating --- and we like moral and philosophical dilemmas.

Ultimately, the SCP Foundation is a literature project which produces a lot of interesting and unique Sci-Fi or fantasy ideas, puts them under spotlight, and explores in-depth. On top of that, its format and worldbuilding incidentally overlaps with some of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s other interests.

(At least that's how I see it.)

I don't think that's the case. Developing new mundane technology is certainly desirable --- containment of a lot of dangerous, homicidal entities would be impossible without it --- as is researching SCP objects (not all of them have metaphysical information-based defence/offence abilities, after all). Achieving complete understanding of an SCP... it indeed happens rarely, but I think it's because of the format (SCP authors are disincentivized from giving full explanations), not because of in-universe reasons. There are some explained objects --- I think they have a "-EX" tag? *Edit:* [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-ex][Yep]].

If you had thousands of SCP artifacts all at your disposal and enough time to study them and disposable test subjects, maybe there's a way. Maybe there's some artifact you can use to study other artifacts. Maybe there's a meta-artifact that you can use to reprogram other artifacts to do something actually useful for you. Maybe you can then use a meta-artifact to make the drink machine give you a drink that makes you more intelligent, allowing you to then exploit other artifacts that you gave up on before.

Hmm. Well, I didn't say that the majority of SCPs are that good. I can give some recommendations, though.

- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][/There Is No Antimemetics Division/]] --- A series of tales written by a rational fiction writer Sam Hughes, focused on dealing with "antimemes" --- objects that erase knowledge about themselves from memory. Just good in general, has some SCP explanation and exploitation.

- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3000][SCP-3000]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2470][SCP-2470]] --- Extremely dangerous, but exploitable.

- [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3003][SCP-3003]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2195][SCP-2195]] --- Well-researched and detailed, and have solid explanations, if I recall correctly.

- There are some examples of the Foundation trying to do what you're describing regarding research, but it usually goes poorly ([[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal][Swann's SCP-001 Proposal]] and [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld][/Visions of a Better World/]], to name a few). It doesn't have to, but the only example of a story exploring what would happen if the Foundation succeed at building a working theory of anomalous objects is in Russian.

**** While the scp appears to be either the thing creating the meta data or the self consuming narrative itself there is mention in the article that the actual culprit may not be 2747 and instead it's the narrative entity constructed within that then erases the work itself. Think of it like an accidentally generated antagonist or story artifact by the author that then through accident or intent destroys the narrative container it resides within (the story or movie or book). This results in removal of the story from reality making the actual scp the anti narrative element and 2747 just the symptoms or remaining artifacts over the dust settles.

If this combination defines, among other things, a narrative-destroying antagonist --- i. e., if the destruction of the narrative is justified from /inside/ that narrative, if it would make sense for the characters of that fictional work to know that their world would be destroyed if the antagonist wins --- that doesn't change anything. Not /every/ narrative-destroying antagonist /literally/ destroys the narrative it is put in --- think about the Nothing from /The NeverEnding Story/, for example, or [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2470][SCP-2470]].

  - /No Sister of Mine/: 6 characters looking for the seventh; on meta-level, 77 threads about it.
  - /The Scolipendra Wiki/: 7 characters wandering in search of a 7-sided object; on meta-level, 7^{2} pieces of fanfiction about it, with wordcount between 7^{3} and 7^{4}.
  - /I/O/: 7 tracks, one of them (between the fifth and the sixth) missing, each track (34*60+18)/6=343=7^{3} seconds long; on meta-level, 14 reviews about it, and Greene gave it a 7.0 score.

  - /ex lux/: 7 characters and story threads; on meta-level, posts on 7 blogs, 25*7 Twitter posts.

A duality of the "dark destination" may be another commonality: /Punta de la espira/'s mountain is described as either divine or demonic, and /No Sister of Mine/'s tome either gives power or unleashes a curse.

E.g. maybe the original "No Sister Of Mine" actually contained the fragments necessary to complete the final questline, but they were part of the first fiction tier to be annihilated, so the reviews described a version of the game with conspicuously missing parts. Then presumably the rest of the game vanished after the reviews were posted.

I think this interpretation fits with the "layers of metafiction" motif pretty well. The reviewers of "No Sister Of Mine" could infer from references in the game that the fragments should exist, but they couldn't find the actual fragments because they were gone.

At the same time, there's not much wiggle room for assuming some missed context that fixes everything.

Unlike /Taitoru/'s case, though, we could further assume that one of these roles is their /true/ nature (i.e., a hero pretending to be the antagonist or the antagonist infiltrating the heroes), and the other one --- a mere mask.

Considering that the theme isn't [7] but [7, 1 of which is missing and/or different] we'd probably be better off if someone came up with a 7th and posted it - the alternative is someone's going to notice a 7th and not post it, which itself completes the pattern.

******* Sure, but they don't play a significant enough narrative role. In all original examples, the sevenfold objects are noticeable on macro-level of the fictional work: seven main characters, seven realms, seven tracks, seven examples, et cetera. /These/ seven are arbitrary. They are present, but if they invoke the trope, then the third word of the sentence you're currently reading also invokes it.

**** There seems to also be a theme of blurring/breaking boundaries. I think, I'm not sure.

/Punta de la Espira/: The mountain alternates between being compared to a "abode of gods" and a "demonic presence".

/Taitoru/: Explicitly stated that "boundaries blur", implication that insane protagonist slowly loses ability to distinguish between reality and fiction.

/No sister of mine/: unsure about this one.

/scolipendra wiki/: Supposedly characters often wonder between different 'realms', and apparently the series is pretty receptive to crossover fanfics with other universes.

/I/O/: No idea, I'm clueless when it comes to music.

/Mavigne/: There are numerous 'thresholds' that must be crossed. Also, the book is stated to be a nested frame narrative.

/Ex Lux/: readers alternate between different story threads, it's written in a mix of 3 different languages, and there's the thing about 'inner tales' intertwining with 'later tales'.

***** Yes, there's definitely something of the sort, but I think you're mixing two tropes there. One is the "duality" of the destination: the demonic/divine mountain and /No Sister of Mine/'s power-granting/cursing tome. Also this for /Mavigne/:

#+begin_quote
  Mavigne, Or: A Treatise On The Metaphysics Of Inner Space Travel, And The Kingdom Of Erikaar, Whose Name Is *Darkness Made Light*
#+end_quote

The other trope is... Hm. Changing environments separated by thresholds? Different worlds in /The Scolipendra Wiki/ (and fanfics? authors?), different narrations and languages in /ex lux/, and different realms in /Mavigne/. /No Sister of Mine/: maybe different levels? /I/O/ seems to sharply break the pattern with its "seamless flow" between tracks, but maybe "different tracks" still fits.

Or vice versa? Transitions are usually seamless, and /Mavigne/ breaks the pattern with thresholds? Or thresholds don't matter?

/Taitoru/: yes, "boundaries blur" may be a clue we can't place because of lack of information. Maybe there were some significant differences between chapters... On the other hand, "a manga divided into chapters" isn't really a noteworthy trope, but then /I/O/ and /No Sister of Mine/ wouldn't count as well. Hm.

I'm also clueless regarding music, is it common for albums to have seamless transitions between tracks? Aha, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/2pytiv/discussion_what_albums_out_there_are_single/][apparently not]], thank you, Google.

Yep, I think that's it, you're right.

- Blurring of the boundaries between contexts:

  - /Punta de la espira/: unclear.
  - /Taitoru/: a "blurring boundary" between sanity and insanity/real and unreal.
  - /No Sister of Mine/: unclear. Guess: transitions between levels/areas were made seamless.
  - /The Scolipendra Wiki/: inter-universal travellers blurring the boundaries between universes.
  - /I/O/: seamless flow of different tracks.
  - /Mavigne/: blurring of the boundary between the tangible and the intangible (gradual transition from the realm of minerals to the realms of light and silence).
  - /ex lux/: near the end, blurring of the boundaries between different narrations.

Well, cool. We have seven tropes now.

Wondering if it hints a connection between the two (further supporting the 'Foundation is going to be erased' conclusion), or is symbolic of something else entirely.

********* What? No, no, we must do /literally anything other than this/. That is the exact single thing we must not do under any circumstances, why would you even suggest it? We're trying to /not/ end reality, not, not-

Can SCP-2747 bring other aspects of itself into existence? That is, what if once a certain "critical mass" of SCP-2747!tropes is achieved, they somehow end up bringing about the rest of SCP-2747!tropes, destroying the narrative once the process is complete? That... would neatly explain this weird delay with which SCP-2747 works: it allows stories to exist just long enough to have someone comment and review on them, then wipes them out. It's weird behaviour otherwise, why wouldn't it activate the moment a narrative is complete?

Hypothesis: part of SCP-2747's tropes are [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceReactions][/audience tropes/]].

I think /No Sister of Mine/ confirms it. In it, the audience/the gamers were the ones to bring the "futile effort" trope into existence, with their attempts to complete the game.

So, running with the hypothesis, we're currently directly involved with SCP-2747, possibly influenced by its incomplete body to call into existence the rest of it. /Wonderful./ What have you done, [[/u/KBAREY][u/KBAREY]]?

1. What exactly is the SCP foundation?\\
2. Is this entry describing a "fictional" concept (as in, a concept that exists in a fictional universe - the SCP universe perhaps, if SCP is fiction), or are they trying to explain a part of "our" reality? I'd really appreciate some clarificarion, because it's really interesting, but I don't know to what extent it's to be taken seriously.
