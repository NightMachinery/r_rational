Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** How do different formulas, boundaries, and secondary for super speed effect the applications of the power?

For instance compare Flash from DC comics, with wildly varying limits, to Flicker from Doc Future who has superspeed with secondary power but still needs to direct the kinetic energy away to slow down and thus releases the equivalent of nuclear bombs when she gets going really fast; to Velocity in Worm or Velocity Mages in Worth the Candle who can barely do anything because there ability to affect the world is reduced.

To give some examples:

- Unlimited super speed except for absolutely no secondary powers: friction builds up heat, movement displaces air, friction against the ground is required to push yourself forward, etc. As a safety measure, you instinctively hold back the super speed from levels where the friction or air resistance get harmful to you, but you can push past this instinct.

- Mach 1 super speed with all secondary superpowers. You can manipulate the secondary effects in the most beneficial way: ignoring the air unless you want to create a sonic boom or wind, control the friction on yourself to be negligible unless you are trying to start a fire, negate the g-force unless you need it, your mind works as fast as it needs to so you can react if you need to and operate at normal human time perception if not, etc.

- Same as above with complete control over secondary powers, with secondary powers able to scale up to super sonic speeds... but your actual super speed is limited to around only 4x normal human speed.

- Total effective kinetic energy is limited so that it increases linearly with speed (as opposed to quadratically). To make units work... let's say that KE=1/2/mass/(actual speed)*(normal human max speed). You have a reasonable amount of secondary powers, and your max speed is just over Mach 1.

- Total effective kinetic energy has a hard limit so that you can't actually exert more force or transfer more energy than you could as normal human. (I think this would get you Velocity's power and Velocity Mages, but maybe I missed some subtlety or exploit or extra limit).

For some straight munchkinry... pick one tier 1, one tier 2, and one tier 3:

- Max speed: is 6x normal speed (tier 1); Mach 1 (tier two); Mach 23 ie around orbital speed (tier 3)

- Secondary powers: you have an instinct for when speeds would become dangerous from effects like friction or reaction time and your speed of though scales just barely enough with speed and only as relevant to avoiding obstacles but no other secondaries (tier 1); you automatically and instinctively reduce friction, negate air resistance, manage/manipulate g-forces, adjust your speed of thought, in general secondary power activate automatically, etc. (tier 2); all the tier two abilities but you can precisely control them and tune them up or down and apply them in arms reach around you, you can also smash through minor obstacles with no damage to yourself (tier 3).

- Kinetic Energy/Force Scaling: Energy transferred/force exerted is limited to what you could exert without super speed (tier 1); Energy transferred/force exerted is limited by KE=1/2/mass/(actual speed)*(normal human max speed) (tier 2); No limits, also you can magically get rid of excess kinetic energy without need for braking or friction (tier 3).

You can raise a tier by one by taking up to one of these quirks/drawbacks:

- You can only use your super speed for 20 minutes each day (can be non-consecutive)

- You need a 20 seconds to a minute to build up to your max speed when starting from a standstill. You lose speed when changing direction.

- You lose one of your secondary powers (friction reduction, speed of thought, air resistance, or centripetal force management): if you are already at tier 1 you lose everything including even safety instincts, if at tier 2 or 3 you have the danger instinct about the secondary effects but no other benefits.

*** Minor nitpick: Mach number does not refer to a specific speed, it is the ratio of airflow speed and the local speed of sound, which changes with air density and temperature. If your superpower is literally described as Mach 1 you would move faster in hotter or denser mediums.

*** I've always liked speedster heroes. I think the quick thinking aspects are my favorite usage of the power. It would be interesting to see a speedster that basically created a "quick thinking" mode.

Tier 3 secondary powers to maintain perception.

Sacrifice power of moving outside of a small bubble to rank up raw speed to tier 3. Or don't do the sacrifice, tier 2 is probably fast enough.

Take the tier 1 power scaling.

You can read books as fast as you can flip pages. Or Get a large computer monitor to view a bunch of text at once.

Get a keyboard that can keep up with your typing and you can output crazy amounts of writing.

Method of fighting would be to do massive amount of research, find weaknesses launch online trolling campaign and spread information about weaknesses. Let others do your dirty work. Fighting other speedsters would be incredibly risky. You would have absolute advantage in your own bubble of speedy time. But you wouldn't be able to catch any other speedsters.

*** Super speed without super thought-speed is an interesting limitation. Your instinctual reaction time is not sped up, but what you can accomplish with a reaction, is (so others can still surprise you). You can plan things in advance of moving, but you still only do one thing per move, then you have to either transition into the next thing without caution, or stop to get your bearings.\\
You have to get a sense for how far one step will move you, because you won't react in time to stop from hitting a wall. If you had the other secondary powers that protect you from hurting yourself, then you'll destroy the wall easily, but if you don't, then you have to be very cautious.

**** Considering that people can drive cars and ride bikes safely, I feel like you could get decent usage of super speed even with normal human reaction time and thought speed but you would need either open areas like roads or very careful usage in brief bursts.

** At a young age, you were dipped into a vat of radioactive helium, giving you the superpower to spontaneously generate balloons. Here are the rules:

1. You can generate up to 50 balloons a day, and per "summon" you can use up at max 10 balloons of that quota. It takes a fourth of a second per summon.

2. When you summon balloons, you choose a hand and a finger. The balloon will summon in tied to that finger (in a one loop basic knot, like first step of shoelace tying). The balloon is a perfect sphere of rubber with radius 20cm. The string is .5m long. If you summon multiple balloons in one go/summon another in the same finger, the original balloon is shoved out of place with a little force (imagine the new balloon repels balloons, and the old balloon will get shoved according to that). The force maxes out at 10 Newtons. If summoning multiple at the same time, assume the universe computes what happens if you summoned one by one and then pops into existence the result.

3. You draw the helium from a pool of 50 atmos of helium You can choose to invest however many of this daily quota into a balloon. You recharge this after 24 hours.

4. If the balloon has no space to appear, it will replace anything in its way. If you summoned multiple, when the universe computes the displacement of the balloons it pretends there is nothing in the way.

5. You cannot predict the direction the balloons will move due to displacement (unless you munchkin a way. What I really mean is, the displacement works like a balloon repellent appears in the space where the new balloon would form, and by chance the old balloon could basically go anywhere).

6. The balloon being summoned starts off with the string taut (unless it gets displaced)

7. You can magically made the strings stop attaching to your fingers.

8. The magic helium is normal helium, it's not radioactive.

EDIT: 9. Note that putting 0 atm helium into a balloon makes an instant vacuum

EDIT 2: 10. The isotope is chosen from a distribution of it as the frequency found in nature.

1. A "finger" is a thing touching the hole where your finger comes out. This means you can attach to a building with a finger port. However, there must be a part of that that is small enough for the string to make a single knot around. You can choose where on the "finger" the balloon appears above.

*** The nice thing about this power is that rule number 4 essentially makes it a limited matter deleting ability. So, assuming there are other superpowered villains out there, you might be able to murderfy at least one by summoning a balloon in their chest/head/regeneration core. if you want to make a lot of money, there may be some in wearing a big thick radiation suit and then deleting nuclear waste. Though I'm not sure how much people would pay you for that. You also, I believe, could make either of these dangerous activities a little safer with the knowledge that the balloon could initially be summoned 0.5m to your side. Or, if you hold your arm behind you, closer than that.

The next thing that comes to mind is how we define finger. If my finger gets lopped off in an industrial accident, does the prosthetic still count for string tying? What if we increase the prosthetic's length by one joint? What if we were to, say, create a miles-long finger prosthesis that winds its way through a compound containing critical materials or information, and then attach it to your finger stub? Would that let you summon the balloon attached to any point of that finger, thus giving you matter deletion coverage for the whole compound? Because that seems like very effective security, should you have security camera coverage. It also seems extremely scary.

Lay out you custom prosthesis in the foundations of a building, with a network port to plug your stub into for a later date. Months later, a rival political figure holds an event at the establishment. As they stand up at the podium, beginning to speak, the front and back of their suit rips, and they gasp, falling backwards. A string leads from their body, having pierced through flesh and the wood of the stand. Later investigation reveals it tied to a small metal pipe with seemingly useless wiring to allow for articulation. An assassination attempt, with the method only found out much later. Another one-time trick, but if you save it for long enough, many of these buildings could be built this way. Perhaps Balloon Lad was an architect in his civilian life, until he quit after a traumatic event. He now stalks the city, an unknown unknown, taking out everyone he deems a poor fit when they walk within point five metres of one of his famous designs.

Depending on how loose you consider a finger to be, I'm imagining something extendable, shot out (perhaps via air pressure). When plugged into the stump, the entire thing becomes a deadly weapon. No durability powers can stop it - the only people who have ever survived were regenerators.

Eventually, our lad gets more ambitious. 50 atmospheres of helium is, if I'm reading it right, quite a lot. Balloon Lad hides behind 0.45 metres of concrete, beneath the surface of a venue he didn't design. His quarry thinks its safe - his civilian identity wasn't involved in the construction at all. A balloon is summoned, filled with huge amounts of helium, and an explosion rings out, fire spilling everywhere.

Using his Long Fingers, provided by a mysterious backer, Balloon Lad is now never without a bomb. Just as someone might lay a fuse, he lays a finger, stands back, and blows the foundations of a local monument to the sins of an enemy.

Balloon Lad is a national threat. Nuclear waste technician turned government security, turned architect, turned assassin, turned terrorist. He's eventually caught - powered masterminds guiding national superheroes, all regenerators. But he left a mark upon the nation. A mark that said that no power, no matter how seemingly harmless, could be dangerous. A mark that showed how any level of secrecy or influence could magnify that threat greatly. A mark that his hidden backer, who designed those finger prosthetics, who realised his dream of being an architect, who enflamed his hatred of the Other Side, very much intended to make.

... This got a little out of hand, but I started to get invested in the tale of Balloon Lad and couldn't stop. Hope this helps in any case!

**** Prosthesis counts as finger as long as it attaches to the finger-hole, and you can choose a point along the finger to spawn balloons (though, the balloons will always attempt to spawn "upwards", where "up" is defined in reference to Earth unless you leave Earth, in which case it's whatever gravity well affects you the most).

Couldn't you just attack the finger? Although, tiny wires might be very hard to find. I actually can't think of a defense besides actively seeking and killing Balloon Lad.

***** I imagine you could attack the finger, yeah, though of course the specifics are up to you. Though if taken at its most literal level, that the 'finger' need only be attached to the finger hole, is there anything stopping you from just plugging into a building?

As an example, say the floor of some facility is made of metal, and there's a prosthetic 'port' welded to it, such that it may as well be the same piece of metal. If you plug in your finger hole, can you then spawn balloons anywhere on the floor? How would the string be tied in that case?

In a lot of interpretations though, a villain who can delete matter using balloons so long as that matter is 0.5m above a place which their finger is contiguous with is both oddly terrifying and intersting to speculate about. Depending on how contiguous the contiguousness has to be, you could pull off some very long range deletions. Imagine creating a tarmac prosthesis, for example... That happens to be contiguous with the road.

******* That would work pretty well, probably. I don't have any specific munchkins given that limitation in particular, but all the stuff previously mentioned could work given certain architecture. Worst case he could pull a Theseus with a big roll of string or wire attached to the stump. Balloon Lad is a force to be reckoned with! (Given a little ingenuity, and industrial accident, and the correct backing).

*** - Your rules do not specifically state that when you choose a hand and finger to spawn the balloons on, that that hand and finger needs to be yours. As read, I'd say I can pick anyone's hand and finger to spawn the balloons, even at infinite, non LOS range. Eg, I could be watching the president live and then have there suddenly be balloons on their hand.
- You state that the helium is non-radioacive, but can it be a valuable isotope like helium-3? If so, then it would likely be valuable enough to sell at >$1000 per gram.

*** 10 balloons isn't enough to lift you in the air, but it is enough to lift many objects. Then you can launch your hobbyist drone that weighs exactly as much as one balloon's buoyancy (to extend battery life). You would fly it to the object and push the object around, maybe pop one or two balloons to prevent it from rising higher.

Then you'd get arrested by the FAA.
