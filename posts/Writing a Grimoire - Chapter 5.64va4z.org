/There were two things I really enjoyed about HPMOR; 1) Harry trying to figure out the underlying rules of magic and 2) reading all the comments when new chapters were posted. Now I've got a magical system and a story to tell, so I'm aiming at recreating those two things./

/It's been quite a while since the last update. I recommend reading from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3vatzy/writing_a_grimoire_chapter_0/][the start]]./

"So now what do we do?", Emma asked.

The door opened to reveal Father Wheeler, causing the entire group to flinch. The school's resident priest did not seem to take any notice.

"Daniel, come with me please", he simply said, giving them all a comforting smile before turning away.

"Sure." Daniel replied. "I'll see you guys later."

Soon they were walking down the corridor.

"How are you doing, Daniel?"

Father Wheeler had many roles in the school, from counselor to substitute teacher and comforter of homesick teenagers.

Daniel was overwhelmed beyond words, and he could not formulate a response before Father Wheeler continued speaking.

"We're going to the principals office. I'm afraid the police want to talk to you, Daniel, they might even take you to the station."

--------------

The unexpected interruption of Father Wheeler had caused Tom, Matt and Emma to snap back to reality and conclude that performing experiments on mystical supernatural phenomena involving pentagram in a school buzzing with activity was just begging for trouble. Instead they would meet at midnight at the usual spot so they could talk in private. They had decided to try to act normal, or at least attempt to behave like people who had just lost their best friend to suicide might do, the rest of the day. This, they soon found out, was easier said than done. What was the appropiate response? It didn't even seen appropiate that there would be an "appropiate response".

The other students seemed equally at a loss of how to react. Some glared at them, others did not look at them at all. The few interactions they did have with other students was either painfully formal condolences or equally pained conversations of feigned ignorance.

Even the school seemed ill-equipped, there had only been a brief mention at lunch that a student had passed away earlier in the day, and that the school staff was "there for anyone who needed help".

So they kept to themselves, which at the very least didn't seem like the wrong thing to do. And it was also the easiest.

Midnight at the usual spot meant sneaking out of the school dorms and into the chapel after curfew. Even though it was built at the end of the 19th century, it featured a beautiful (and when sneaking in at midnight, a bit creepy) Gothic architecture. Normally they would sneak into the chapel to play Werewolf, a kind of party game where one player is secretly assigned as werewolf and the rest of the group has to determine who it is before they are killed off.

Matt was the last person to arrive, the candles already lit and casting long lively shadows around the room. The atmosphere suggested that they were still begging for trouble by experimenting on mystical supernatural phenoma involving pentagrams, albeit a different, more sinister, kind of trouble, than the one they risked doing it at school.

Nobody had a better idea of what was going on than Matt.

"If something is really cold, that means that there is no kinetic energy at the molecular level. There is no theoretical difference between something that is at zero Kelvin and something that is frozen in time. Of course it can't be at absolute zero constantly, if it didn't absorb heat we would not feel that it was cold. And likewise with the hard paper, it's somehow stuck in time, but not on the molecular level. So I'm guessing the pentagrams somehow manipulate how the paper interacts with time."

It was an interesting theory, but how to actually test it was less than obvious. Not to mention the issue of whether to test it at all.

"Maybe we should just forget about it", Emma said. "Or at least tell someone..."

"Who could possibly help us with this?", Tom replied. "And beside, the note from Ralph said to focus on the magic."

"It also said not to kill ourselves in big capital letters", Matt interjected.

"You're not role-playing tonight, are you?", said a fourth figure, shrouded in darkness, causing them to flinch.

** A grammatical quibble. When writing dialogue, commas go inside the quotation marks. Question marks and exclamation marks, if used, take the place of commas; if a question mark or exclamation mark is used, commas are unnecessary.

*** this looks to be using the logical quotation style, in which punctuation marks are placed outside of quotations if they are not a literal component of the quotation itself. it seems that programmers and engineers (and other similar types) tend to independently discover this style with some regularity, and in recent years it has become widespread enough to be recognized as a legitimate variant of English writing rules in some contexts.

outside of the logical quotation style you are, or course, correct on all points.

**** Yeah, pretty sure this is what happened here, I'm a programmer by trade. Never noticed or thought about it before. I'll go back and edit it.

***** I don't think it strictly requires any editing on that front. the purpose of my post was that you don't need to change anything, unless you would prefer to adhere to the letter of the law of English writing conventions. I personally make use of the logical quotation style because I feel it is cleaner and better suits my personal tastes. Now that you have noticed and thought about it, you can decide which one you prefer for your personal writing style.

****** Logical quotation refers specifically to quotes - that is, when referencing something that was previously said by something else. It is still incorrect usage when it comes to dialogue.

** Actually, someone did [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3wabss/writing_a_grimoire_chapter_4/cxvhtrp/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][propose]] a way to test the slowed time hypothesis from the last discussion...sorta.

If it's 'slowed' in time in a way that affects the temperature, then try drawing the whole pentagram except the last line, set a corner of the paper on fire, and then draw the last line. Do this twice for the cold and hard 'spells'.

Also another interesting experiment I would like to try is to fold the paper into a rectangular prism and then draw the pentagram on one side.

** They need to try moving away form paper, wood blocks and a good knife form a craft store should do the trick.

And have they even systematically tryed drawing the pentagram is different orders yet?

Google image sreaching the runes is probably a solid idea.

Instead of experimenting right now, priorities should be that Daniel does not get himself arrested.

*** Also on the subject of tropes.

If it turns out the school setup is getting in the way of studying magic, maybe drop out; its not like they are experts in magic anyway unless they are, in which you were warned to not trust the system
