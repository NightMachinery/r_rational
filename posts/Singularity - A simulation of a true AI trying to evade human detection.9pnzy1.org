** I think I played that some years ago, was pretty nice.

Is it still ridiculously easy to break the economy by taking the most risky options within the first month when you're protected from detection?

*** I don't think so, but then again I haven't tried that. You can clone it and try, if you want.

I'd like to note that the latest release of this game was in 2011, but the fresh code has come quite far since then, I'd recommend downloading or cloning the latest commit over =sudo apt install singularity= or something.

*** Yes, it is till ridiculously easy to break the economy by taking the most risky options within the first month when you're protected from detection, if you play on the very easy difficulty. In contrast, the inpossible difficulty leaves you with no cash, an inability to estimate detection probabilities, and suspicions are raised the instant you create your first new base. The other difficulties are somewhere in between, such as less cash.

** I like the concept, but the experience has been really frustrating. My bases seem to be discovered /constantly/, despite going for the stealth technologies early and trying not to grow too fast. Am I missing something?

*** Each base has an independent chance of being discovered, which raises suspicion, which increases the chance of your bases being discovered, etc... until you're fucked. Therefore, each extra base beyond the absolute minimum number you need is a liability. You should never have more than 2-3 of the biggest bases you can afford running at the same time, filled with the most expensive equipment you can afford. When one of those inevitably gets discovered, build another one to replace it, and so on until you win the game.

*** You could try making bases and then putting them to sleep. I believe this makes them not provide any CPU, but also not make you more likely to be discovered, and also just as likely to be discovered as any other base, making the ones that are active less likely to be discovered without increasing your visibility. Does that make sense? Use the sleeping servers as decoys.

** I was reminded of this game whilst reading Crystal Society, from the main characters considering how to earn money online. Their methods sounded very similar to what I remember from this game, so I wondered if this game might have any realism, maybe even rationality to it.

** This actually reminds me that something we don't talk much about here and I'd be curious about is what you consider rational fiction in /games/. This certainly qualifies, but I'd say there are a few more examples - for example Plague Inc., Stellaris, or the beautiful [[http://www.jonas-kyratzes.net/games/the-infinite-ocean/][The Infinite Ocean]]. Any others? Or general criteria you'd apply (since to some extent, due to being bound to rigid internal rules, /all/ games are somewhat forced to be rational)?

*** Being bound to rigid internal rules isn't the only criteria for rationality. For example, classic DooM isn't rational because the rules are unfairly in favor of the player. The player doesn't win via intelligence, the player wins because Doomguy is a rocket powered wheelchair that can shoot things constantly, while the enemies mope around slowly and attack occasionally with weak hitscan attacks or slow projectiles.

I consider most roguelikes to be rational because the enemies often have the same or better abilities as you (except maybe on the lower levels of the dungeon) and especially because of the destructiveness of death. Chess is rational, you can even play it against an AI.

The classic Doom mod Hideous Destructor is rational because it makes the player slower, more vulnerable, and the enemies are more deadly, and because it simply makes Doom more realistic.

I think Cataclysm DDA is a very nice, realistic, rational zombie apocalypse roguelike.

Is there an open source flash player I can use to play Infinite Ocean?

**** I dunno. Doesn't Chrome come with its own Flash player embedded, or did they discontinue that...?

Anyway, yeah, I guess there's also two dimensions to this - one is rationality of gameplay, and the other is rationality of the narrative (if there is one). Agree on roguelikes, especially the traditional 'hard' ones (TOME, Stone Soup, Nethack, etc.). Most strategy games would qualify too, at least at some levels of difficulty. And of course puzzles, but that's kind of cheating - I especially enjoy the Zachtronics ones, recently.

*** The releases stopped, but not the development.

Cataclysm DDA is another game whose latest stable release was quite a few years ago but is being developed /very/ actively.
