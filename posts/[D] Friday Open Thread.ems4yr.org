Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/][Baba is you]] is pretty great.

It's a puzzle game where the environment has a number of statements, statements like =baba is you= or =wall is stop=. There statements are defined by objects in the environment, and you can push those objects around. For example, with those two statements above you could do =wall is you= and become all the walls in a level.

It can be very difficult at times, many levels seem genuinely impossible to start with. It's amazing at getting you to verify your assumptions.

*** Level is [something] is both the most creative and obnoxious game mechanic I know. Still, it's a great game. Towards the end there's a level you solve by going to a previous level, turning that level into a flag, then going back to your current level and making "flag near level is win" . I was both impressed and salty when I got that one

** Because I'm getting a lot of people asking me if I'm OK with the fires in Australia, don't worry, they aren't affecting me whatsoever. If it weren't for the media I wouldn't know about them; my region is having a normal fire season (which is to say, I know of two big fires nearby, but they're regular big fires not apocalyptic big fires). It is still a very big deal and people in my region are doing what they can to help.

Also, I am planning on being in LA, SF, and Vegas between the ~1st and ~18th of Feb. Planning on catching up with [[/u/callmesalticidae]] but if anyone else wants to say hi, would be pleased to arrange it.

** This week I learned how utterly trivial it is to gain access to a user account on a computer without knowing the password! After a medium-large lecture with 100+ students I was answering questions and floating around, during which time my macbook pro mysteriously disappeared from my desk (the nerve!) as my back was turned. A friend offered to give me one of his old MBPs as a replacement, only he's out of town currently and would need to return in order to play around with different passwords. A quick google and terminal command in recovery mode later -- literally 2 minutes, including search -- and I had complete access to all unencrypted data. No need to remove the SSD even! Looks like there are equivalent steps to take with Linux and Windows systems.

**** I did! But with no success. This was also on the very first day of the quarter (so there's no real rapport built yet), and I'm not actually entirely certain a student swiped it, just that it wasn't in my bag when I left as I'd assumed, and I'm usually very thorough about triple checking my area to make sure I've not left anything. When I noticed it was missing an ~hour later I returned to the lecture hall at the end of the following class and it wasn't there.

There's a chance I just left it there in my haste to not impose on the next instructor's class time (there were lots of questions!), so I hung out and harassed the next class / instructor during the Thursday meeting but nobody claimed to have seen anything left behind. Nothing's turned up in any of the local lost and founds either. It's also pretty distinctive with lots of stickers etc. so it seems unlikely to have been picked up by accident. And I had location services / find my mac enabled but I guess it got turned off during some OS update or something. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Nothing mission critical was on it given both local and remote backups (it's also used almost exclusively for teaching, rather than research), but it's still pretty obnoxious to lose a ~$600 device! (esp. since I only make ~$20k / y). And my friend's replacement is actually a bit better in some respects (it's a refresh older, but with higher specs). So it's no catastrophe, at least.

** I'm a student studying a Masters in Engineering. My latest assignment is within my Engineering in history module and I have been tasked with creating a poster on something that interest me. I have chosen to create my poster on the human life span, planning to go through historical changes on the human life span and quality of life and ending on transhumanism, singularityand the possibility of living forever. I've had a look at Eliezer Yudkowskys website for inspiration and references.

Are there any interesting conclusions I can make, or further reading anyone could suggest. Or any good ideas for a title. I am also looking for good infographics related to the topic, or potentially survey results I can use to create my own. TIA

**** Why are you so pessimistic about the outcome? My priors would be in favor of the teacher caring just as much as they'd care about any other project given equal quality over them punishing [[/u/TheFlameTest2]]. Punishment would require that the teacher both will think negatively of the project /and/ be a teacher that'd punish a student for disagreeing with them. Although people like this do exist, in my experience they tend to be in the minority, and although (I think) it is even more unlikely that the teacher rewards [[/u/TheFlameTest2]], the reaction proportional to quality of work hypothesis still dominates.

****** Ok, I'd place that in very weak evidence in favor, and although it increases the chances of your hypothesis, I would think it more likely that someone who refers to prestige would only punish someone if they directly insulted someone or something with prestige, rather than introducing an arbitrary new idea. It's not enough to combat all the factors working against the hypothesis here. Things such as better things to get angry about, basic apathy (potentially caused by being overworked, having many projects to grade, wanting to get back to research (good old publish or perish), etc.), and human decency (even in a population selected for deference, I would predict people still being kind to one another, and not dishing out arbitrary punishments).

** (Let's dust off /this/ ol' argument, it's been a while!)

In the past [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=drivesdk][I've written]] about what it would mean to make a "rational game" in the same sense as rational fiction. As a term it's ill-fitting, but the same is true of "rational fiction" so I didn't pay it much mind. Some time after writing, I was exposed to the term "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnpAAX9CkIc][systemic]] [[https://youtu.be/9RvbIP4yDvU][game]]", which almost completely encompasses everything I associated with "rational games", independently converging on the same idea.

A game being "systemic" could be contrasted with a game being "directed". Events in directed games are scripted: a house burning down is triggered only after a particular event, such as a cinematic or after the player does something specific like "press X to interact with candle". A house burning down in a systemic game, however, is handled by the designer crafting rules that permit for houses burning down: things made of [WOOD] react a certain way when exposed to [SPARK] or [FLAME]. A specific NPC interaction might still result in a candle getting tipped over at a time decided by the designer, but it's /also/ pertinent when the player swings his torch in the closet, or when a lightning strike occurs, or when a ricocheting bullet hits a [METAL] item.

The designer still gets a burned down house in the end, but the difference is that in a systemic game a set of general /rules/ have been decided on, and the player is invited to explore those rules and use or abuse them as much as possible.

Sound familiar?

We've tread (and re-tread) the argument about what "rational fiction" means in the past, and it's always been brought up by various parties that "rational fiction" is a bad name before continuing on to ignore the label and discuss what it is we actually mean by the term.

Would "systemic fiction" work as an adequate replacement for the term "rational fiction"?

I do not think that "systemic fiction" covers literally everything that the term "rational fiction" today covers, but that is partially because the term "rational" is stretched to cover various associated-but-not-necessarily-similar aspects, and partially because there are differing opinions on what, exactly, deserves to have emphasis.

"Systemic" also does not imply the "thinkiness" aspects described in the current sidebar, has nothing to do with "rationalist" motives, and while it enables munchkinry it does not suggest it. Nevertheless, having a (neutral!) term to cover specifically a work that has consistent, logical, and plausible magic rules, worldbuilding, interpersonal interaction, and faction conflict seems to me to be a beneficial increment over what we have now.

Thoughts?

*** I had an old 'essay', [[https://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2020/01/narrativism-vs-simulationism.html][Narrativism vs Simulationism]], that goes into that division somewhat, but I think that's only one axis to divide fiction on, and not necessarily the one that best gets at rational fiction. After all, a reader doesn't necessarily know whether or not a text is a result of narrative or simulation, and it would be perfectly possible for the text itself to never give you enough clues. A work can be "rules-based" in the sense that it's based on rules, but if those rules aren't exposed to (or discoverable by) the reader, then it's all kind of moot. To give an example:

/Star Trek/ writers pretty famously put in "(TECH)" into draft scripts when they needed technology to work some certain way, which would then get filled in by someone else later and never held up to any scrutiny. Pretend for a moment that someone goes through all the work to make some set of episodes incredibly grounded from a technical perspective, with explanations for every bit of technobabble and a coherent science bible ... and then /doesn't actually do anything with it./ What's shown to the reader/viewer is all the same, and the work of making everything internally consistent is left on a hard drive somewhere.

Now, the generation method in both cases is one that I would term "narrativist" and you would term "directed", but given that they're (hypothetically) the exact same text, I wouldn't actually say that one is rational fiction and the other isn't. Now, if you added in and exposed a bunch of the technical bible, that would (to me) push it more in the direction of rational fiction, even if the method of generation was still narrative/directed. It's that exposure of deep thought on cause and effect, science, engineering, etc. that helps something to be rational fiction, because it makes it more 'thinky' and substantially changes the focus.

I've been idly working on an essay that delves into narrative focus and the way that two stories which contain the same events can be really variable in how 'rational' they are, but I really need a good test case, which I've been having trouble finding. There are stories where the engineering is just magic that happens off-screen after the engineer declares that he's had a brilliant insight, and there are stories where we follow the brilliant insight and have it shown to the reader, and it seems to me that this is largely about where the camera is pointed, rather than what's going on at the object level.

*** That rather reminds me of [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/][Noita]], a roguelite with a sophisticated physics engine, procedurally generated world and extremely customizable weapons. The physics is exceptional, along the same lines as powder toy and you can do a lot with it. A perfectly reasonable solution to lakes is just drinking them, all the generic explosive barrels have actual oil or gunpowder in them and you can drink your enemies blood (if you have the vampire perk) to regain health.

The difficulty is such that you're required to exploit the wand mechanics to get to the 'end' and win. Another thing about the game is that while it appears to be linear, all the areas in the game are actually part of one huge world with repeating parallel universes to the left and right and sky dimensions on the top and bottom.

***** In that case, systemic fiction does not work as an approximation to rational fiction, in my view. Rather, a work's position on the systemic/directed axis has /nothing/ to do with its placement on the rational/irrational axis.

The reasoning is as follows. Systemic/directed is a statement about the world - how it moves along to reach its goal. Rational/irrational is a statement about the protagonists, and how they react to the world in which they find themselves. You can have rational characters in a directed world, irrational characters in a systemic world, or any other such combination.
