First, let me apologize for the horrendous click-bait nature of my title (rational protagonist trope help felt too dry) and try to explain my problem and rationale. So I've been a big fan of [[/r/rational]] and the fictions posted here for about two years now and have read most of the big fictions discussed here but I very rarely comment and have never posted before. Recently I've had an idea for a rational fiction I'd like to write but after having relatively no trouble in coming up with a concept for the world, general plot direction and side characters for the fiction I find myself inexorably stuck in creating a 'Rational' protagonist.

The big reason being that at some point I realized my development of a 'rational protagonist' basically boiled down to making a normal protagonist or a mary sue and then beating it with the rational stick. the 'rational stick' being tropes that I've unconsciously ascribed to making a character rational, some of these tropes I've been able to pin down and I'd like your opinion on why I'm stuck on these tropes, if they are as prevalent as I think they are and if they are actually important to making a rational protagonist.

*Appearance & Mentality*

This is fairly simple, it's obvious that a perfect protagonist is boring for a myriad of reasons but in trying to create a flawed/nuanced one I realized that I was just playing this weird game of whack a mole with personal attributes. Say for example an attractive and smart character would have to have some personality problem or mental damage/deficit to offset the positive attributes whilst on the other hand, an unattractive smart protagonist would have a good personality. Is this an unconscious bias I've developed due to preference or something similar or is it a rational trope? is it possible to have an enjoyable rational fiction with a protagonist who on the surface has the characteristics of a prototypical Mary Sue?

*Power vs Price*

Any victory or power up that the protagonist gains must cost something or have an effect relative to the actions of the protagonist. This one frustrates me mainly because its something that I've realized is affecting my ability to enjoy other fictions now that the idea is stuck in my head as it dulls and lessens the gratification I get as the reader when I can predict outcomes, as this gives me meta-knowledge as a reader over the narrative. How am I (as the reader) able to enjoy a resolution to a conflict when I know there is going to be repercussions on the protagonist? Another example of this would be that if the protagonist is attempting to gain some kind of large power-up or achieve a lofty objective as the reader I can predict they are going to fail because it would change the nature of the story too much or appear as to be too irrational or Mary Sue-esque for the protagonist to be that 'overpowered'.

*Luck*

I understand that a lot of what people come to read rational fiction for is to avoid things like Deus ex Machina's and luck deciding outcomes of major plot points, but isn't it irrational to discount it completely? If my protagonist has a rational plan of action for overcoming an obstacle or achieving an objective and it fails only to be rescued by a well thought out/clever BUT essentially random act of chance, is that still beyond the pale or is it far enough away from Deus ex Machina on the sliding scale to be enjoyable?

What I wanted really from this post was to attempt some discussion about what makes a rational protagonist to selfishly help me avoid mistakes with my own personal project. any ideas for other possible rational protagonist tropes/foibles to avoid or thoughts on my rambling?

​

ps. Sorry if this post is against some rule or if there is a better place for this discussion I'm a lurker at my core and as such don't understand how posting etiquette works also it is very late where I am.

​

Edit: A lot of people are pointing out that I've used Mary Sue incorrectly which is true if you can get past my ignorance and instead substitute what I meant with Mary Sue to instead mean a perfect/flawless character that would be much appreciated. I'm not going to change the original post though because the explanations of what people believe Mary Sue to be are as interesting to me as what I originally wanted help with by posting this.

Also, some of the reply's might seem out of place if I change it.


** Here's my two cents, as someone who's a fellow lurker and a reader and writer of a lot of fiction in general.

To be rational, your character doesn't have to be hyper-intelligent, or fit into certain personality types. They just have to make the best choice possible for themselves with the best information they have. Other traits /can/ be added to this, like giving them curiosity to find out more information in order to make more informed choices, but nearly any personality could fit under that umbrella.

Too often rationalist fic writers go for the "I'm smarter than everyone else and always make the best choices and always succeed, except for that one time I failed to prove I'm not perfect" protagonist, and I'd argue that yes, that's a Mary Sue. However, that problem isn't fixed by giving them more flaws. An unattractive stuck up hyper intelligent person is still just as annoying to the audience. The problem is solved by giving them more personality, so readers have more to like about them than them just being brains on a stick.

As for the rest, I think you're experiencing what a lot of people go through when you first start dissecting a creative field. You learn about shot composition, and suddenly you can't stop looking at how things are framed in movies. You learn about the three act structure, and suddenly you see it everywhere. You struggle with introducing characters to a scene, and suddenly you take note of every character introduction. It breaks the magic for a bit, yeah. But eventually you can get to a point where you can both analyze a piece of media /and/ appreciate it in the moment.

You're dead right that this is a problem I have I've thought about it before but I don't know if it's an eventuality with me. Personally I find that I know when something is truly enjoyable and good because I'm so immersed in the media that I don't analyze it. It's usually when I start picking something apart and criticizing something that leads to me to consciously acknowledge that I'm not enjoying it.

For example, I recently finished playing God of War and there was a moment near the end that built up the power of the villain in a cool way. As soon as the scene started I realized what was the function of the scene was ("this is a scene to show how powerful the bad guy is"), but it was executed so well I was loving it and taking notes in case I need something similar in my own projects.

**** I want to add on to the above's suggestion of having more personality.

Humans are contradictory, and that is not irrational. Even Bayes thinking is being able to hold possibly mutually exclusive world views while adding evidence to figure out which is less wrong. But, every plausible reality is treated as true.

In humans, we have loads of different motivations and situational views, and whether or not there is an underlining theory of every view, each one exist for a reason. (Rational self reflection would be to examine them and see if any should be removed, or if there is the unifying view.)

In this way, when a character has multiple rational directions that lead to mutually exclusive actions, there is drama.

A character cannot always choose the "best" option, because what that looks like is different for everyone and for the different internal motivations. In Mary Sue stories, other worthwhile options are not presented, the Mary Sue has only one view, making that the ideal, and thus the only option, and flat.

Likewise, in your post, you mentioned something about commensurate negative outcomes to balance positive ones. That feels like if the universe were 'fair' and/or there were a deity keeping the scales balanced. But the real world seems to not be that. Innocent people die, immoral people get masses of power and are never punished. Now in stories, authors tend to go that route (escapism?), especially to prevent the Disney "always a happy ending" or the George Martin "never invest in a character, for their pages are limited".

However, with that said, a satisfying rational fiction can exist without anyone dying (it has been years since any of my coworkers died on the job).

Final note, one of the reasons I love the show Leverage, is that almost everyone acts in a way that makes sense for their own motivations. Unlike some of the questionable Rational Fiction where there is only one rational actor. When only one person makes sense, then of course they are going to end up powerful and always right.

​

This could be literally everyone all the time, if you interpret it broadly enough.

Rationality has to do with making optimal decisions by overcoming natural biases - that is picking the best choice *despite* other influences.

So the character has to do more than just pick based on their motivations and values and information at any given moment - they have to be self aware enough to decide rationally, to overcome bias and irrational self deception.

This requires some base-level of intelligence, otherwise they wouldn't be capable of identifying and counteracting their biases.

** I don't necessarily think rationalist protagonists are often Mary Sues, so much as I think the process of "thinking rationally" is often treated as an unrealistic power fantasy.

In the worse examples of this, we see the main protagonist as basically the only person who is able to think and reason at a high level. The story becomes more or less a series of obstacles which only the smart protagonist can overcome with their superior intellect and the rest of the characters are relegated to bit players whose actions ultimately don't matter outside of the way the protagonist chooses to utilize them. (I'd say this is a trap that stories like HPMoR /almost/ fall into. The saving grace being that there are other major players who the hero is initially dismissive of who are playing at or above his level the whole time.)

But, IMO, the better constructed stories have main characters whose rationality isn't necessarily their defining feature. They're not just fountains of knowledge and wisdom whose sole purpose is to solve all the problems that the other characters are too stupid to solve. Instead they're just relatively intelligent people who make the best decisions they can with sometimes flawed information that sometimes turns out well for them and sometimes turns out poorly. They make decisions that you the reader might even disagree with, but you can always follow their logic and understand why they made those decisions. And the supporting cast of characters sometimes will even outshine the main charcters with their planning and contributions to solving issues. (I would say a story like Worm, or Worth the Candle falls more into this category)

Even in most stories that fall into the first category, the majority of authors will still give their characters some non-superficial flaws that take them out of the realm of a Mary Sue. A common flaw seeming to be that the characters are good at solving logic problems, but bad at reading people and dealing with interpersonal issues.

So personally I'd define the issue with a lot of rational fiction to be more of an issue with unrealistic power fantasies, than one of pure characterization. Not that power fantasies are inherently bad, but when they go too far, they kind of ruin the enjoyment for me.

As you pointed out, works like Worm (and pretty much everything else Wildbow has written) do an excellent job of making sure characters other than the protagonist can think too. That is a good safeguard against ending up with a rational Mary Sue.

** 1. No.

2. A Mary Sue is a narrative black hole, from which no light escapes. Everyone's narrative arcs, characterization, and thinking is warped in the presence of the Mary Sue, bending in service of making the Mary Sue as awesomely awesome as possible. Smart people get dumb around the Mary Sue. Confident people quake in their boots. Seasoned veterans tremble in awe at the combat prowess of the Mary Sue.

   It's pretty easy not to do this, if you're paying attention to what your characters would /actually/ do, especially those who aren't the protagonist, so long as you have good models for those characters in your head. So long as the protagonist isn't warping things around them in detectable, unnatural ways, it's not a Mary Sue.

3. Adjacent to that is the concept of a character who's 'too perfect'. They /don't/ warp people around them, but they're still far above average in almost every respect. They're smart, funny, educated, dedicated, wealthy, and attractive. Leaving aside the statistically correlated stuff there, there are a few reasons that this is problem within the narrative. First, it usually doesn't serve a purpose within the narrative, and is boring to read. Someone who is all 10s in every category is difficult to characterize, and because characterization /should/ be tied to plot, that's a major problem for the narrative. The second issue is that it can read as wish fulfillment. While there's nothing wrong with wish fulfillment per se, it tends to be boring because it's lacking in tension, and writing wish fulfillment that doesn't come off as brainless popcorn is tough, largely because you don't have as much texture to work with.

4. Specially with regards to rational fiction, my own opinion is that all you really need to do is show someone thinking things through in a realistic, intelligent way. You don't need them to be wicked smart, you don't need them to get it right every time, and you certainly don't need them to be some uber-mensch wunderkind.

*** Thanks for the reply I'm a big Worth the Candle fan. I think it was a mistake using Mary Sue the way I did, I meant it as hyperbole for a very capable character with no surface level flaws when it's become obvious it means something very different.

I guess I'm mainly interested in how you create a character who presents to the reader as highly capable without making it seem like any negative attributes I assign to the character looking like a piss-poor attempt at obfuscating the characters capability instead of the intended creation of nuance.

#+end_quote

Easiest way is to make it relevant to the plot, or to their interactions with other characters. If the highlighted trait is 'capable', then we want a 'but' in there, with the particular flaw being something that ideally works at a tension with whatever trait we're highlighting.

'capable but insecure' = double and triple checks their work, has difficulty accepting assurances of others, has a hard time making friends

'capable but jealous' = makes rash decisions against rivals, rushes to publication, cruel and vindictive about the flaws of people seen as equals

'capable but rebellious' = self-sabotaging in situations with authorities, difficulty getting establishment trust/respect, prone to saying the wrong thing for the sake of individuality

Note that these characters would only barely be two dimensional, but that's better than nothing. Ideally you think up reasons for their foibles and ways that they can either overcome them or come to terms with them, which then ties in with your plot somehow. If someone is capable but insecure, then it's pleasing for that insecurity to be rooted somewhere that gets revealed to the reader, and to have some way for that insecurity to be overcome. If you say "this character is extremely capable but insecure" and then never actually show that insecurity or have it come up, that's what looks problematic.

(I'd also not that you don't have to undercut capability if you don't want to, so long as you can find some axis on which you think either direction is perfectly sound, or where preference for some approach doesn't actually make them worse, so long as that preference can still have impact and drive tension/conflict.)

**** I think your problem lies in thinking of negative traits as something annoying to tack on. If done right, your character flaws should be the most interesting part of your character, tied to their virtues, and a huge part of their personality. Maybe they're tough and independent - and so they push people away who are trying to help. Maybe they're academically smart and dedicated - so they neglect their own health in pursuit of study and are helpless in the real world with street smarts. Maybe they're charismatic and popular - and get frustrated and make bad choices when people treat them as just pretty face. Flaws /are/ your characters.

What about your characters' good traits? No trait is ever completely good or bad. Try and think of good traits you've given them and think of ways in which those same traits can put them at a disadvantage or get them in trouble.

Brave - maybe they rush into unnecessary danger, or don't admit it when they get hurt and their injuries and stress compound.

Loyal - maybe they stick with a friend even when that friend is going down the wrong path, or they're torn between two friends where neither choice is right.

Generous - Maybe they're giving away money and enabling someone to mooch off them and can't afford their own rent, or maybe their generosity is masking self-depreciation where they don't believe they're worthy of having nice things.

**** I have not built characters for the sake of effective narrative, but here are my two cents. Create events in the backstory of the character's life that gave them both a skill and a defect. When both can be traced to the same origin, it feels less tacked on and more like character depth.

Another way to do this is for the character to have a maladaptive schema: Their attitudes are useful for some situations but harmful in others (eg. reacting to sudden movement). This can make the character capable in some scenarios but show weakness in others.

** A rule I used in HPMOR is that at least one character is better than Harry at any particular thing that Harry does, or has more of any positive trait. Not that Harry is necessarily bad at it, the other character is just better. Even when it comes to an attribute like startling weirdness, Dumbledore still has him beat. This doesn't shadow Harry since no other character strictly dominates his combination, but it gives him something to learn everywhere. The sole exception is that Harry has read more explicit science (though Hermione is catching up) and that is not actually most of what the story is about, even if it appears in many chapter titles.

Of course, this trick relies on telling a large enough and deep enough story that your character can be defined by many interesting positive qualities, instead of one or two big “character-defining” traits; and to do that you need to understand multiple virtues deeply enough to write them in ways that seem fresh, which is a large ask and one that can't be filled by writing artifice alone.

A problem you might be having is that you have no idea how to show somebody being very good at something without being perfect, and therefore think in terms of giving them artificial “flaws”. Can you remember a time when you were very good at something but still had a lot more to learn?

** I think you need to understand the common definition of Mary Sue and rexamine these points. Mary Sue's are generally defined by a lack of real challenge. This means that they don't significantly struggle with external or internal problems. Rational characters aren't inherently like this, but also aren't immune to this by definition.

Mary Sue rational characters use their rationality to easily solve all problems encountered while never having to significantly change or examine themselves.

Non-Mary Sue rational characters use their thinking as a tool to solve the problems facing them, and adapt themselves to new challenges in an attempt to meet them.

"Hitting a character with the rationality stick" would tend to make Mary Sue's just like giving main characters power ups without similarly powerful challenges to use them against. The best rationality stories avoid this with powerful challenges, HPMOR generally makes everyone more rational so they are better challenges for example. Other stories have non-rational villians be more experienced and entrenched in the setting than the protagonist for example

Using your knowledge of how stories tend to flow to predict them can lessen your enjoyment of some works for sure, but the best works hide or avoid common paths making them more interesting or are done so well you don't mind their predictability. (The movie Avatar springs to mind as very easy to predict, but still very worthwhile to watch for example)

Make more characters "rational" than the protagonist, perhaps in different ways, or as different realizations of the same ideals, etc. (This where most people say "Especially the antagonist", but I'm a fan of the Martian, and I think that maybe a story with more than two characters should be about more than two characters.)

If you're narrative arc doesn't naturally create drama post resolution your go getter protagonist can maintain drama after winning by /voluntarily/ taking on a new bigger project via there augmented powers. The plot doesn't necessarily have to be forced upon them to punish them for success (To give one example of how to deal with this).

Don't play whack a mole with personality traits to create flaws. If you're straying into Mary Sue territory I suggest making /every/ character a perfect Mary Sue... according to someone's view of perfection. Unless you're intentionally writing a very impaired individual that everyone in the story recognizes as such, you should not start with perfection then ko a personality trait... You should be working at full throttle to simulate various flavors of people trying their best to be perfect interacting. If you're doing this right i think you should be running flush up against the limits of your /own/ conceptions of perfection (genuinely wondering what the right action would be in the character's shoes, and having different characters choose different good answers among the ones you come up with) , and your character's flaws and conflicts almost reflect your own internal uncertainties (or modeled off of the visions of perfection of people that you know very well). After that you can add normal wobbles like losing temper and so on, nothing as heavy handed as hacking off an entire personality trait.

** Mary-Sue... I don't think that term means what you think it means.

/First,/ a MS is not perfect or flawless. One of their major flaws is an utter unawareness of their flaws. If the author is unaware of the flaws it's only because of the self-insert nature of the protagonist and a certain level of pride that only teenagers and very sheltered young adults arr capable of. Everyone else recognizes the flaws on some level, including older versions of the author.

MS characters in mainstream fiction avoid the label by being full of self-doubt. Look at works popular with teenage girls for some examples (and considering women drive 30% more purchasing decisions, and fathers of girls are total weaklings when it comes to saying no, that's a great demographic to try to appeal to).

/Second,/ MS characters are defined by a plot that bends over backwards to fulfill their wishes and fantasies. For example a MS might have an irredeemably abrasive personality as well as a harem that includes Cpt. Picard, Megan Fox, and the Pope. If the plot doesn't bend for them, they're not a MS.

Some examples of this near miss can be found in day time tv comic relief characters. They ignore their flaws and it bites them in the ass. Lassie in the first season of Psych comes to mind, though he eventually gains some self awareness and starts to try to work out his issues.

The combination of arrogance and undeserved privilege are what come together to make a very unpleasant character, and it is so potent that it got its own name (hold on there's an irony or pun in there, ah well it's too hidden for me to find).

As long as you keep clear of that cliff, you have miles of room for how powerful or lucky your characters can be. Consider the Loopers in MoL, adult Son Goku, and Comics Golden Age Super Man. None of them fit the MS trope despite being Gods among men, simply because the plot only does what they want when they make it do so.

She is also physically attractive enough that guys will sometimes stop in shock when she walks by and start obsessively stalking her, dic pics and all. She is fun and interesting to talk to as well.

That isnt interesting and based off of that information alone, she would make an extremely boring Mary-Sue as a literary character. Giving her a few warts or a propensity to be cruel wouldn't solve the inherent story issues of such a character...

However, if you add-in that she am legally blind in her right eye (which isn't due to a visible defect), has an extreme phobia of dogs, and a minor terror of water that she cannot see the bottom of, things get more interesting. Not because she has a few negative traits, but because they arent immediately apparent and could be brought out in relevant areas of the story. Most importantly in a "real" character, these flaws mostly have little to do with her strengths. Because real people are not balanced so carefully.

Effectively, the answer is yes. Starting off with a stereotypical Mary-Sue can work great and is arguably more interesting in subverting expectations. Especially when you drop her in a lake and she starts screaming that the lake monster is going to eat her. Suddenly readers want to know what on earth is going on. (for her it's the rare shark that can swim in fresh water, she had some older cousins scare her about it when she was very little and it still bothers her as an adult).

Or what if a villain tosses mud in her face, covering her left eye and suddenly she is completely blind in a key fight?

Power Vs Price...

My biggest question is "why would it be bad for the story to change?" You can keep your themes and throughline the same while changing the stakes or focus.

Consider a protagonist battles for a powerup and wins. They get a short time to play with their new strength, but quickly realize it is changing them too much. Like Dr Manhatten of Watchmen, they discover personality issues and unlike that character decide to give up the power to preserve their identity.

You could run an arc of them realizing this and quickly using their power to take out a rival or remove some obstacle they always disliked, then the process of giving up the power. Suddenly you have rational character growth (would you want to be a god if it meant you died and a twisted copy of you was the result?) and the readers can see an important aspect of the character in stark relief.

Luck...

Luck is great and important, just dont make it common or forget villains have luck as well. For my own story, I might decide any particular event has a lucky occurance. So I roll dice 50/50 to see which side gets the luck. If a character has a streak of luck, then it will be commented on by witnesses. Also, I wouldn't generally let luck determine who wins, only the degree of victory.

So a lucky villain might take a headshot in the neck (returning with the results of a broken collarbone) or a lucky hero might get to a hiding spot because a villain was distracted at a key moment.

I hope this helps. I'm at work in my phone, so probably a few typos that I missed. Best of luck with your stories 💕

** (Brief luck contemplation: In reality, with impartiality guaranteed, luck is accepted. In fiction, I feel the hand of the narrator in every big-or-small exertion of luck, more so when it drives a plot forward in some way. Even if contrarily lacking realism as a result, it becomes more viscerally satisfying when every step climbed is like in Chess, a will-imposed-on-the-world consequence of the character's own thought processes and choices, rather than closer to reality where chance can be the pebble that alters the flow of events.)

​

Edit:

​

Power vs Price: Noted by others, but this is indeed frustrating, and nice when subverted. For instance, hidden magic or secrets, and knowing that narratively nothing will ever be allowed to get to the point where it threatens the status quo of the overall world/Masquerade; wonderfully refreshing when things actually do barrel ahead unstopped, overturning the chessboard and throwing the context-world into chaos. Hmm, note that it can also be fun sometimes to have stories where one person has an unconquerable cheat, and while 'winning' with it isn't always fast, there's no (need for) suspense about the ultimate outcome. For instance, if you can always go back to an earlier time with no fear of death, an example of possible interest interest instead being the use of that to tease out murder culprits' evidence or other mysteries while no one else has any idea of one's game-changing power. There can be limitations to make it more life-risking, but there don't have to be in order to enjoy the psychological interplay of different motivations and behaviours.

​

Appearance & Mentality: Maybe something digressing from the original line of thought, but when it comes to personalities thinking in terms of 'perfect'/'personality problem'/'good personality' may be limiting oneself to a rather one-dimensional perspective, in which you start with a 'perfect personality' and then treat any possible changes as detracting from perfection and thus making it worse. There are lots of different personalities/minds/outlooks that you can have, without having to cast differences as flaws. For instance, a deontological outlook (prevent wrong actions) compared with with a utilitarian outlook (lessen wrong outcomes). Fleshing out personalities, you can have a compassionate person A who views person B as unscrupulous and nihilistic, and practical person B who views person A as naïve and narrow-minded. (Perhaps a 'hero and antihero' comparison.) They can clash, and both their courses of behaviour can go wrong in ways that they're not happy with--the person A showed mercy to took revenge for humiliation; B thoroughly eliminating a potential future enemy earned the condemnation and alienation of society and a friend--but you don't have to write one personality type as a a paragon who can do no wrong, and you don't have to write the other as the protagonist-but-wearing-blinkers, and you don't have to write both as some third person, wearing different blinkers for A and B, who without them would have made the 'best' choice in every situation. Each person makes different choices according to their own value systems and desired outcomes, and it's arguably best (for me?) if a reader can fully sympathise with all sides.

​

A&M addendum: I'm put in mind by contrast of a certain idiotic-and-belligerent type of cannon fodder seen in a certain type of story. I smile in disapproval when something painful happens to a character and that character immediately starts smashing lots of their own expensive belongings--something by this point seen in many different stories, though of that same type--with the thought "Ah, this author is doing this too, just in case the readers were in danger of almost relating to that character for a moment.". (Now, smashing the hard-to-replace valued belongings of the person who /caused/ the painful thing, that would make a little sense, even if still foolish...)

** Personally, I think you could solve a lot of your problems with writing, by thinking of it like this:

Rational stories aren't fun because the main character is a bit of a Mary Sue. Rational stories are fun, because there are a lot of "Mary Sue" style characters, all exceptional in different ways, all competing and clashing and arguing. To overcome your writing problem, maybe make a few main 'rational' characters who could have, theoretically, been the main character. Make them all different. And then pick the one you want to actually write the story about only after you've fleshed out all three, for example.

Like in HPMOR. It's not just fun because Harry is rational. It's fun because Dumbledore is rational, and Quirrel is rational, and Hermione and Draco are both, in their own ways, rational. All of the above characters theoretically could have been the main character, and it could have still been a rational story. It would have been a different story, with a much different tone, if Hermione or Draco had been the lead, but it could have done, and with the way the characters are written it still would have been fairly rational.

To me, that is the crux of good rational writing. Rational protagonists often seem like Mary Sues when compared to normal characters. And the best way, I think, to fight that is to just keep on adding rational agents to the story. The best rational stories have very few dedicated 'side' characters. Worm has such a large cast, precisely because the author keeps introducing new, smart people, all working on their own agendas. The best parts of HPMOR are when Draco, Hermione, and Harry are all scheming against each other, all with varying degrees of cunning, intelligence, and rationality. A well-developed cast is what makes or breaks a story; if you're character is the only rational person in the work, then of course they're going to seem like a Mary Sue. But if their Big Bad is rational, and their rival is rational, and their friend is rational, then nobody is going to notice, because it's hard to accuses a character of being a Mary Sue when they get countered and beaten by equally gifted peers. Like how in HPMOR, Harry doesn't always win, because everybody else is also allowed to be smart.

Essentially, what I'm trying to say is this; if your aim is to write a truly good rational fic, then I personally believe that the main feature that sets your protagonist apart from the rest, should not be their intelligence. I love rational stories because they allow the world and setting to be rational, not just the main character. Your main character should not be the Chosen One because they're really clever; that's a bit too on the nose. Instead come up with something else that makes your protagonist special, so that everyone can be clever. Let their rival come up with cunning plans that trap them. Let the Big Bad actually try to hide information from them, so that their plans can be truly surprising. Let the evil enemy spy actually be scarily competent, so that logical thinking isn't enough to uncover their identity. Don't write a rational Mary Sue in a dumb world. Write a rational agent, in a rational world, and let things play out organically.

The best example I can think of this being done in mainstream fiction is A Song of Ice and Fire, where the main characters routinely get killed precisely because they forget about this. People lose wars because they forget their bannermen aren't robots that have to be loyal, but living, breathing people who are going to look out for their own skin. People get betrayed by their own soldiers, because they forget to properly communicate and inspire them, and instead treat them like machines. The kings who choose to not bother with the scheming get murdered by the ones who do, because just assuming loyalty in this series is deadly. And while all the in-fighting and scheming is going on in Westeros, a girl across the sea is raising dragons and a guy in the north is raising a zombie army, because the best thing about a rational story is when the main characters get ganked by an enemy that was working out of their point of view the entire time. The books could actually, in a way, just be titled "Everybody Else is Allowed to be Clever too, the series", and it would work.

** This is something that I've been thinking about too while writing my own fic. I'll admit happily that I don't think of course it's entirely /realistic/ for things to go as well as they do to my protagonist - after all, real life has no "protagonists" at all, anyone can die at a moment's notice or lose because of a simple stroke of bad luck. "And after conquering most of the enemy's country, the general died of a stroke before the capital city fell to his siege" would make for a terribly anticlimactic story, but it can certainly happen.

My solution to it is, to pretend that fiction, especially fiction that's trying to be entertaining, can ever be /fully/ realistic is nonsense; there's always going to be something, if only the fact that a story makes sense on a grand thematic level while real life doesn't. A story is like life would be if there was a God actually holding the wires. And a lot of rational protagonists certainly are designed to illustrate the qualities that characterise them and thus are pitted against challenges and opponents that suit them. If Harry Potter-Evans was faced with an angry Hulk with no prep time or warning and no wand he'd simply be dead, no matter how much he thought. But that doesn't mean they have to be Mary Sues or Gary Stus. They still can have flaws, make mistakes, interact in the world in ways more interesting than just "always wins". It's a bit like, say, superhero stories. Most superhero stories end with the good guys winning, but that doesn't mean that all superheroes are equally Mary Sue-ish.

** It's certainly possible to make a Sue out of a rationalist character, but it's not inevitable. If the character goes into the setting and instantly solves all the presented problems through the Power of Rationalism^{TM}, that's a Mary Sue. If the character goes into the setting and solves /some/ of the problems, and makes a bit of headway on others, but actually does worse on some of them than they might if they used a different approach, or screws up or makes mistakes despite (or even /because/ of) their rationalist mindset, then that makes for a more interesting story; rationalism isn't being portrayed as the Sword of Infinity+1, but just another tool. And it indicates a deeper understanding of rationalism if it's shown to /not/ be the best tool in certain circumstances.

Sometimes it can be fun to see rationalism applied to a problem and the result being... not failure, per se, but a less complete or less comprehensive result than might be obtained otherwise. (In a fanfic, a weaker result than the canon solution.) And a good story will have non-rationalist characters who aren't just there to be filler; perhaps they're likely to jump in first and solve something without rationalism, or contribute useful non-rational aspects to a solution, or just provide a form of balance.

It was one of the reasons I liked Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality; Harry the Rationalist achieved a lot, but often he'd make assumptions and have them be completely wrong because he hadn't bothered to do his research; non-rationalist characters who were more knowledgeable about the wizarding world could trump him, and a lot of the time he only came out on top due to his thinking and actions being different and thus unpredictable, not necessarily because they were actually /better/ for the situation. He actually misses out on making several canon allies/friends/companions, including Ron, Hagrid, and Sirius, never meets Dobby, and never buys Hedwig. There are also running issues with Harry realizing he isn't like other children his age, and being concerned that there might be something /wrong/ with him.

Of course, it can be fun to write parodies where /everyone/ is super-rationalist, just to see how this twists the plot, character arcs, and approaches to challenges.

​

Also, I suspect rational fiction is influenced by a founder effect on the kinds of protagonists that its readers empathize with most. If Lesswrong had been targeted at an audience of business people and self-improvement health nuts instead of STEM-specialists and Harry Potter fans, we'd likely be seeing a very different breed of rationalist. And that would probably be reflected in the kinds of protagonists we typically see in rationalist fiction.

** Rationalist protagonists can easily have undertones of Mary Sue to them because of the inherent traits of the rationalist... subgenre.... thing. They have tones of being didactic, and are written under the assumption that a certain way of viewing the world, rationality, is true. So if you choose to have your story star a rationalist protagonist, who is a rationalist from the outset, you may be writing a protagonist who coming out of the gate is correctly aligned with the works ideological reality. Mary Sue characters are the same way, the way that they see the world and act in it is the correct way. So what else can they do in a story but be right and win all the time?

Now, this doesn't mean that writing a character who agrees with the story's ideological universe is invalid. Most superhero fiction operates on the base assumption is that fighting crime is good, and people with superpowers should do so. But the big difference is that most superhero fiction doesn't ruminate on it the way rational fiction. They say "punching baddies is good" and don't belabour the point. So it's easier to ignore.

How you can avoid this? Well, one thing is to ask whether even if your story is rational does your protagonist need to be, can he not just develop to be so over the course of a story? A second is to just not worry so much about the story being rational, because actively trying to be a thing makes it more likely for you to hit the pitfalls of that thing.

** I wrote a pretty big post on this a while back, but it was off topic at the time. The main thesis was that the "Mary Sue" is a collection of symptoms that are all indicative of a bad work, grouped together for convenience. Because they're grouped together, a work can be sort-of-bad, or even just unconventional, and still have a protagonist that is Sue-ish. You can have protagonists that exhibit all of the symptoms of a Mary Sue, but aren't one simply because those symptoms are all expressions of the central theme of the story. A good example would be someone like MacGyver, who is attractive and competent, but is still interesting because he solves problems in interesting ways. Assuming Harry from HPMOR is flawless in the story, he still falls under this category because he does fun things in order to solve the problems that he faces. However, because the Mary Sue is a Bad Trope that only Bad Stories fall for, and Harry is symptomatic of one, Harry must be a Mary Sue and HPMOR must be a Bad Story.

This is bad - it shifts the territorial dispute from "whether or not the story is good" to "whether or not the main character is a mary sue". It's like the blegg-versus-rube debate: the qualities intrinsic to Sueness aren't necessarily indicative of whether you'll like the story or not. Arguing about whether a story is good might result in useful writing heuristics, but most of the Mary Sue characteristics (luck, attractiveness, success) are just staples of storytelling to begin with, so you can debate endlessly about them without it going anywhere.

If you're worried about having a character come across as a Mary Sue, don't bother writing rational fiction - you could make the main character a down-on-their-luck sack of garbage, and they would still be a Mary Sue in the eyes of this sub's critics, just because they occasionally make a decision that happens to work out. I've seen people call the protagonist from /Worm/ a Mary Sue and she loses her identity, friends, family, and arm in the end, all in the pursuit of a nebulous goal, before being summarily executed, like what the fuck. Instead, you should focus on the basic quality of your writing. Make sure the rest of the characters have interesting personalities that play off of each other, make sure your plot is paced in such a way that the resolution is thematically appropriate. Make sure you can write, in the sense that you have all of the technical skills of a good author. The rest is just noise.

Yes, there's definitely a point where Mary-Sue traits become noticeable and annoying. But that point is pretty high. Unless you're writing slice-of-life or something, your character is the hero of their story, they're going to be doing incredible things. They should be more talented than the average dude, they should have fewer flaws, it's okay if they get the occasional crushing victory. This goes double if you're writing original fiction- the main issue with Mary Sues imo is that they're OCs who warp the story to be around them but because they're OCs they don't fit with it, have as much of a stake as our canon protagonists, etc.

Remember that Harry Potter, Superman, Ender Wiggin, etc. none of these are Mary Sues, or if they are they're Mary Sues millions of people like just fine.

One of the most popular fanfictions of all time, Paradise Lost, is about an angsty rebellious protagonist with unique magical powers who becomes a king of a whole realm due to rebelling against literal God and not immediately dying.

Main character of Harry Potter, a fairly popular book, is a flat nothing as far as character goes, but is revealed to have a Unique Power or Special Talent in practically every book in a sequence which defies all probability, and finishes with him surviving a /direct killing curse/ just because he is so awesome.

Honorary mention goes to Waves Arisen, which has an absolutely awesome portrayal of a protagonist that doesn't fall into one of those super stupid "we have to have a fight between teammates because we can't use basic English to talk about it instead" moments, and I will fight anyone who says it's not amazing.

Having characters which are neither perfect or completely unreadable has nothing to do with that character being a Mary Sue. Firstly this is just a property of writing in general, that if you can make a perfect or irredeemable character interesting as a protagonist it's so hard it's rarely attempted by good authors. Plus not having any flaws actually relevant to the plot (ie one's that actually hinder them) is a pretty quintessentially Sue-ish quality.

As for the character's actions having negative consequences; again this is the exact opposite of what you would expect in a Mary Sue story. This is also another quality which while not /necessary/ for a story to be great is still much more indicative of good stories than bad ones.

Not having deus ex machina's is also another example of something that is the opposite of what you'd expect from Sue-ish stories. It's just usually indicative of good writing in general, because deus ex machina's almost always feel cheap and are often/usually the result of author laziness.

So you could have framed this as "How much should we adhere to what common wisdom considers good writing?" which is equally likely to get clicks I would imagine and isn't just false clickbait.

***** Oh yeah, there are definitely better ways to frame them for sure I did say this was my first post here and it is a post ostensibly about dispelling some of my own ignorance around the subject's I brought up. Yes these are qualities generally perceived as being good writing but the specific ones I brought up seem to be endemic specifically to rational writing or at least they have a lot more importance put upon them and are less forgiven when not adhered to I'm sorry if I didn't get that across as well as I thought I did.

Also, the false clickbait was just a bit of a shit joke and if this low level of harmless clickbait affects you then the rest of the internet must send you into violent fits.

****** These qualities are very uniquely common is rational writing, they're just more common than you'd normally see in other online writing. These are all qualities that are vastly more common among actual published writing than internet writing (especially less polished stuff), and the more "serious" the writing the more common these qualities seem to be.

There's a reason there's been several different posts on this subreddit that were basically "Are the qualities of rational writing just qualities of good writing generally?" (to which the answer is always /sort of/). If these qualities seem especially endemic to rational writing to you, then it's because the non-rational stuff you consume isn't trying particularly hard to be "serious" or "realistic", because in say literary fiction for instance these qualities sort of seem like the default.

******* Sure literary fiction is more adherent to the qualities I bring up overall but the thing I like about what we're terming 'rational fiction' is that to me it kinda comes off as genre fiction through the lens of literary fiction. Which to me at least is rather unique especially for online writing, with this post I was only attempting to learn and dispel some of my ignorance around the subject. I'm sorry if I'm reading the tone of your replies wrong it does happen with text conversations, but it comes off too me like you're annoyed at me for trying to learn? in which case I can only apologize...

That actually seems like a pretty good description and one I'm rather fond of, there's certainly other differences but overall probably nothing else of equivalent length could work as well as a description.

I mean I was certainly annoyed in my initial post because you were describing qualities which are if anything most indicative of literary fiction as being Sue-ish, but you're projecting that onto my later comments.

********* Then I'm genuinely sorry for projecting. I'm still confused about the attributing qualities as being sue-ish though as I really didn't intend to. If I've not already insulted and bored you enough could you point out what specifically you have gripes with me attributing as Sue-ish I am actually really interested.

********** I suppose the biggest gripe is that the qualities you are describing are very heavily about /avoiding/ Sue-ishness by not making it seem like the world is rigged in the protagonist's favor.
