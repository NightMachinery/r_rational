I really want to start reading Worm, but I'm scared of how lengthy it is, so I'd like to know how long it usually takes people to read it.


** I was in sophomore year of college when I read the whole thing, I read it for a good two hours every night before bed and almost every spare moment during the day. Once winter break came, I was reading a lot more. I think all said and done it was a month or so? I read fairly quickly, but it's looooonnnggg.

The real thing about Worm that I feel no one warns you about is that you're (probably) reading it on a computer, so you aren't holding a huge physical object that lets you feel how far you have left to go. What that means is that you'll think 'Oh wow I'm so close, let me just try to finish it tonight so I can be done.' But you're actually still half a million words from the end. If you've ever read a really engrossing book, something you couldn't put down, something with a really engaging climax that you just had to read right-the-hell-now - then imagine that feeling persisting for the entire length of a normal novel. That is what is crazy about Worm.

It's really good though, I highly recommend it. Just be prepared for it to eat your free time for the next while.

Maybe that's my problem, why I haven't been reading as much as I know I should. I've historically been very unlikely to begin reading a new book unless I'm in a position to "no-life" it.

***** Ward hasn't updated from the superheroes being real and the end of the world.

Worm was interesting in how the ridiculous "cops and robbers" was purposefully maintained.

The villains were great, the world was deep, the characters all felt lived in.

Taylor's actions all flow logically and we get to see how she uses her brains and a weak power to win.

Ward doesn't have the same feeling.

The economy doesn't make sense. The world ended but apparently there are enough surviving fashion designers to give everyone crazy costumes. Wildbow will describe a detailed silk lattice with armour and greaves as a costume and then later describe starving refugees.

We see all the great cosplayers on Reddit and how much time, effort, and money that takes.

Now imagine all of the great cosplayers on Reddit were doing that in the middle of modern Syria.

It doesn't make sense.

The story is about the parahumans not keeping to the cops and robbers from worm.

They start engaging in patented wildbow nightmare fuel which is great... But no one is questioning why these people in a New Orleans two years after Katrina are still wearing costumes and making up cool nicknames that explain their own powers to possible antagonists.

The old parahuman order should be breaking down by having more and more parahumans not bother to wear capes and make up names.

But no.... It doesn't and the story doesn't explain why these people who are worried about surviving through the winter are still concerned about having the right team name.

Also, the current arc has our protagonist, who can lift cars and fly, repeatedly fail to use any effective methods to combat her antagonists. In worm, we got to see Taylor use her power in novel and effective ways and were impressed.

In Ward, our protagonist repeatedly fails to do anything to her antagonists.

She wants to be non lethal when she's throwing concrete blocks, they're throwing molten glass, and others are using 12 foot telescoping razor blades.

Wildbow is writing fight after fight where we are essentially, as readers, told to watch 20 people have a non lethal gunfight. (The antagonists also use guns). Yet, our protagonist, when fighting people who have guns refuses to match their lethal intent.

In the last arc, a flying parahuman was throwing molten glass at an incapacitated teammate from the air.

Our hero caught her, put her gently on a hill, and told her not to do it again.

Because the villains are just lovable little scamps.

Wildbow's amazing body horror is there in what the villains do, but our protagonist doesn't respond reasonably or effectively to it.

It destroys the suspension of disbelief.

In Worm, you would wonder how Taylor and the undersiders could possibly win and Wildbow would surprise us with sometimes brilliant.

In Ward, you see exactly how our protagonist and her team could win and Wildbow surprises us by having them do something dumb.

I hope it gets better, but it's been hard.

**** Spoilers for Worm

Not the guy you're responding to, but I had trouble finishing Worm. For me I just got kind of tired of the constant peril that had Taylor an inch from dying but making it out alive. Obviously that's a pretty common predicament to put book characters in but at a certain point it just felt like too much. But more specifically there were 2 main developments that had me stop reading for a while before coming back.

The first was when they defeated Coil. It was just so unbelievable to me that the writer would have Taylor defeat this villain with the same reactionary, by-the-skin-of-her-teeth style as she beat every villain. With Coil's power and information, if he's making the first move there should be absolutely zero chance he fails. He could ask his precog for the stats on any assassination method he wants to try and he can take as many attempts as he wants to get it right. This really should have been an opportunity for Taylor to outsmart him and his power in some way, but instead Coil has to be given the idiot ball for a couple of chapters so that he can try and fail to kill her.

The second time I stopped reading was the big time skip. The way it just glossed over the Endbringers as a threat (2 more are introduced as basically an afterthought) and Taylor's efforts to reimagine her image as a hero was just very jarring. Obviously the books would have been even longer if the story had taken its time with that 2 year gap but it's just really poor pacing in my opinion. Maybe Taylor should have spent less time as a villain so we could see a bit more of that story, and maybe they shouldn't have introduced 2 new Endbringers who have essentially no impact on the plot beyond maybe being a misdirection to make you think the world is going to end differently than it does.

And at the end of the day I still don't know what's up with the Endbringers. The story suggests that Eidolon is responsible, but how exactly? And if his power is waning how does he make 2 more? And if he's responsible then why does the Simurgh censor information about the true nature of the Passengers to keep it from getting to Dragon in one of the Interludes? I think for how significant the Endbringers were to a lot of the story these kinds of questions should have been addressed with some satisfactory answers.

Also, I haven't really been able to get into the sequel either, I just don't much care about any of the characters and nothing very interesting is happening with the plot.

The timeskip was pretty bleh, i think everyone agrees on that

The eidolon thing didn't bother me though, I presumed his power just awakened what was already there (we see in the entity interlude eden created the endbringers and was going to awaken weaker versions to challenge the parahumans)

****** ** Spoilers Below **

It's clear in the story that Eidolon's shard was one of the most important to the function of the entities. If you think of him like a codex, basically able to rifle through every available power, and when you consider that the primary drive behind the distribution of powers is conflict, it would make sense that he was the conduit through which the so-and-so's were born, in order to serve the ultimate purpose of the entities, which is what every cape was really doing.

Of course, if you really want to get into it, there's always the possibility that he /wasn't/ creating them, and that Scion just knew that /telling/ him that he was would confirm Eidolon's incorrect suspicions. After all, there's no rule saying that Path to Victory requires it's user to tell the truth. A perfectly timed lie would be just as devastating as the truth.

But I do think that the /sequence/ is a major candidate for "things Wildbow would have rewritten if Worm were a regular novel instead of a web series". It has the sort of feel I get after running an arc in a tabletop campaign, where the players have defeated the salient combat threats, but never really understood what was happening.

I was hoping that they would concoct a plan to get around his power, but instead we just have him using it flippantly in a confrontation with some very resourceful supervillains (which is especially confusing since we had an interlude dedicated to how he was being even more careful than usual with his power to leave nothing to chance).

****** It's been awhile since I read it the second time, but here is what I remember. The first time I read it, it seemed like Coil just had the idiot ball for narrative purposes. On a second re-read, though, it seemed like a legitimate win. Coil has a few weaknesses; he tends to split realities multiple times a day. He's egotistical. He tends to split realities as soon as he feels it is safe, even if it isn't. And in this particular case, he was up against a time crunch so he couldn't just have one timeline where he tried to off Skitter and one he could collapse to if it didn't work out.

As soon as he split a timeline to help kill Skitter more efficiently, it was over for him. Skitter's ability to think creatively and improvise with her power (with, potentially, a little bit of help from QA. I'm going to need to reread Worm again after some of these revelations from Worm about how shards interact) beat out the ability to see the short-term consequences of two different actions so she was able to escape.

And then, of course, Lisa had been playing the long game in a way that his power could not predict. That was the final blow, but the path to getting there was entirely in character and was not just him holding the idiot ball because the plot needed him out of the way.

In my own experience it was one of those really exciting books that made me downright crave more after every chapter.

A good estimate would be 30 min per chapter , judging by Pocket's duration estimation for the last couple arcs, but there are a few outliers with 90 min estimated reading time. The earlier arcs have much shorter chapters.

If word counts give you a measure, the chapters were 5000--8000 on the average.

Another comparison: /A Song of Ice and Fire/ / /Game of Thrones/ 1--4 are 1,350,000 words altogether; Kobo estimates 112--123 hours for that.

The worm audiobook project was a life saver in this, as it meant I didn't have to listen to the Google text to speech voice for the whole thing, though I used it for the arcs where I wasn't fond of the voice actor or couldn't understand them. I also was simultaneously listening to the We've got Worm podcast, which is basically a 2-4 hour analysis body each arc, depending on length, so that definitely slowed my reading.

After downloading the whole audiobook I can vouch for the fact that it is 180~ hours long, so if you read as fast as a voice actor that is a number, though they usually read rather slow for clarity.

** iirc about a year and some in total -- it was decent, but not /that/ good, and by the end I was reading it more out of a sense of obligation to the story than anything. Tried reading the sequel and dropped it after a dozen chapters

as a point of comparison, I read the first ~35 discworld books in about as many days, which extrapolating from [[https://imgur.com/a/ybHmR][here]] would have a hair under 4.5Mw

(had a lot of free time my first semester of college, taking a relatively small number of credits to ease the transition from HS, and they were all intro classes, so I read 1-2 books each weekday evening... nothing on the weekends though)

for further context, I'd say Wales' content is the most readable on this sub -- I made it through the first ~60 chapters of WtC in about a month, and e.g. The Dark Wizard of Donkerk in an afternoon. Something like HPMoR was more like Worm, rather slog-y by the halfway point

Try reading a little, and then if you keep wanting to read more (including 'finding out what happens next'), do. Reaching the end of something worthwhile should, ideally, be a little saddening (though also satisfying) rather than a relief.

To put it another way, let reading-some-more-of-it be a pastime to savour rather than a challenge to tackle, and if you find reading it isn't enjoyable enough to do that then don't.

** The thing is, it doesn't feel that long. When you're reading it, you're not "like gosh i still have so much left", its like "all this awesome stuff has gone down and I still have 2/3 of the book left? great."

I could have finished in about a month reading on the bus and during weekends instead of playing videogames. However I accidentally spoiled a major piece of the ending reading the worm wiki and have been stuck on the last 5% for about a year just prioritizing other books since i already know the final resolution. Even if you forget who a character is don't go to the wiki if possible.

** I think I did it in about 6 or 7 weeks over the course of several evenings and a couple dedicated reading days on the weekend.

Frankly I think it's best not to try and rush it. Worm has a lot of high pressure situations back to back and not a ton of downtime once it gets going. Ie. There is almost always some emergency. Taking it slow on the reading can be a good way to lower the intensity a bit.

But if you're interested give it a read. It's a great story. If you're unsure then try to set your target at reading the first 8 arcs instead. That about covers enough setup plus parts that show why people love it so much. Arc 8 in particular is a doozy.

** Took me about 2 months to get through it by spending all of my free time every day (and all weekend every weekend). It was enjoyable at first, then the headaches came. Then the stubbornness won out and I honestly can't remember some parts in between. Totally worth it. Not doing that again.

** I no longer have the information saved for how long it took me to read Worm, but I'll extrapolate off of Ward since it seems reasonable that my reading would have been roughly similar for the two.

With Ward it took me 41.89 hours to read up until the end of Arc 11, which was 1,075,020 words. Worm has 1,778,057 words, so just extrapolating the known information into this would put it at 69.29 hours. According to Moon+ Reader I read at an average speed of 329 words per minute, so adjust those numbers by your own reading speed to get an approximation for how long it'll take you.

This is inexact, but I decided to post it because it always irks me when people give answers like "one month" to your kind of question, because there are so many variables that go into how much reading can be done in "one month" that it ends up being a useless answer to me.

** I do not recommend you read it in 5 days. I woke up, read, ate at cafeteria, and read. It was slack week for first quarter finals.

At some point I just kept reading looking for the end and didn't really internalize what was going on. I only really started to enjoy the worm universe when I found the fanfiction community.

Speed reading didn't give me enough time to be able to look past overarching issues with stuff like pacing.

I'd say read through Leviathan ish and then take it easy from there.

** I must be going on 3/4 of a year, at least. It's become a part of my life.

I just took a break during the Echidna battle's interlude chapter (Blasto) to wrap up Crystal Society, which I was reading simultaneously. (There's a Vista and a Myrddin / Myrodyn in each. Confused me each time I ran across them.)

I'm also an avid player of Disney Heroes: Battle Mode, where various Disney movie characters battle a horde of infected creeps / clones in a city surrounded by water, so there's another bit of synchronicity in my life. I imagine Skitter with the visuals of The Thief from the game. I ended up being the Noelle of my guild on server 3, directing us to a surprising level of victory in PVP play... and a surprise battle against the top guild. It felt like going up against the Slaughterhouse Nine; we were wiped out almost to a man.
