** It looks like the start of what could have been a very interesting story...

If it hadn't been abandoned, five chapters in, eight years ago.

*** My feelings exactly. I read through what's there, and it's enough to interest me in more, but there isn't going to be any more.

** I remember liking the earlier, longer and completed work by the same author - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] - very well.

It's been quite a few years, but if I recall correctly, it involves a nice culture clash between the two main characters (who find themselves fighting side-by-side) in regards to such points as to what constitutes acceptable levels of ruthlessness and overkill.

It was then quite disappointing to see the following fic - /Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure/ - abandoned so early.

** Found this on FFN. It's not quite rationalist, but I think people on here would like it. It's humorous, but the world it builds makes sense and is at least partially rooted in knowledge of medieval history.

** I feel like compared to this, the whole "immortal lich" plan would require a significantly lesser amount of human sacrifices.
