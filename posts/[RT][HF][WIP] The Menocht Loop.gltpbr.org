AKA Mother of Learning Gaiden: This Time, It's Social\\
(not actually related to Mother of Learning, though clearly inspired by it)

The main character is stuck in some sort of time loop. If he fails his mission, someone - or some/thing/ - resets him back to the hated dinghy.

If he takes the scenario too far off the rails (by storming the capital and demanding answers, for instance) he's reset back to the hated dinghy.

All he can do is struggle through, over and over again, hoping to figure out what they (it?) /want/ from him.

And in the meantime, his decemancy (aka necromancy) is growing ever stronger.

Essentially, this is Mother of Learning + Re: Zero - Konosuba. When the story starts the main character already at the point where his magic is strong enough to immediately win any conflict of power - but the story's not about that. It's about him figuring what, exactly, the criteria of the loop are; and the isolation doesn't help when it turns out that sometimes the criteria involve /not being a creepy loner/ (which was a pre-existing condition).


** Well, I discovered this 4 hours ago, and binged it. So I guess I think it is pretty good.

** I'm up to chapter 17 at this point.

Mistakes like this make me wonder if I've gotten too used to the high quality prose in AW's works. Everything seems stilted, the dialogue seems off. The culture seems a mishmash with heavy American slang (for example "formal") setting me up to expect everything else to be American then juxtaposing that with its own jargon. The motivations and sense of experience of the main character are hard to grasp, for example we're meant to think he's been on the first loop for years but he only lost a limb when he was in that coffin? And yet there wasn't any sense of confusion or complexity with how he solved it, which seems fair if it's meant to be about how he stalled on the first level but regardless seems off with it being the first time he has cut off a limb.

One example of the dialogue feeling just really not right is at the party where he's talking to some elderly matron and she's like "well we don't let anyone below 65% in". It's like if you were a club for people who bench and they said "well if you can't bench 84.3kg you shouldn't be in this club", it's something you can imagine being written on the rules but you'd think some ancient club (at least that's the sense I'm getting from that) should have better ways of being snide.

Something like "Well if you can't beat the trials with your eyes closed" or "Well if you can't even lift yourself" don't use numbers. To be fair Mother of Learning was not exactly high quality writing either.

Also in the first fake out, are his decisions meant to be stupid because surprise he can undo them or are we really meant to believe this actual 30 year old thinks this is the best way to live his life after getting out of the time loop and believing he is one of the strongest practitioners on the planet, it's like reading about Hercules deciding to hide his strength so he can try to get a 9-5 job stacking shelves

Not to say it's irredeemable, the worst thing about these books is there's always some good ideas and concepts that just need a little guidance or refinement

** I caught up and it kind of feels like the plot is just meandering around. There's no real stakes and lots of characters are abandoned once you get to the next layer.

The only similarity to MoL/ReZero is that it's a time loop.

*** Well, "no real stakes" is kind of a feature of time loop stories - Re:Zero gets around it because Subaru never knows when a loop is going to end and he'll have to deal with the consequences, but MoL has it in abundance for really long stretches.

What I do like about this story's approach to the topic of stakes is that, since it's a more character focused work, the fact that there's no real stakes is actually a problem for the MC - he's gone a bit psychopathic during his time in the loop, and is having difficulty connecting to people who are just going to reset anyway.

You can see this in the second loop, the "slice of life school days" one. His interactions with normal people are just completely off until he decides to put on a mask and pretend. Linda is the clearest example - he's just going through the motions of a relationship to seem normal. There's also his interactions with his mom later where he completely misunderstands her motivations

The plot does meander around but that's largely due to the scenario-based setup; the plot's generally going to be "how do I get past the next scenario", unless the MC decides to goof off in a solved scenario.

**** You say that but you admit both of the stories it's being compared to find ways around it. Why not assume the question knows that?

***** That's kind of my point - MoL has very low stakes for most of its runtime. I don't think Zorian encountered anything that could actually negatively impact the loop until roughly the end of the first section with the arachnea, which (in terms of word count) was about where this story is now, if I recall correctly.

I fully expect this story to have some way of raising the stakes relatively soon (the current scenario is well suited for it), but of course you can't tell until it happens.

Low stakes are kind of just a thing that happens in time loop stories.

** I'm just about to start Chapter 10, and I'm finding it a bit light on exposition so far. For instance, we're at a school, but we're not told nearly anything about it except that it's a school. The MC gets a test that measures "affinities" but there's no real effort to explain what the number given is a percentage /of/.

I just don't feel like I'm being given the details necessary to understand what's going on beyond the surface level. And given that this is a story that seems to be trying to sell me on the mystery behind the time loop, being stingy on basic information about the setting doesn't bode very well.

It's not bad, not to the point where I'd stop reading it, but if I catch up to the last chapter that's been posted and it hasn't given me a better sense of the world it's in, I doubt I'll pick it back up.

*** And, after finishing Chapter 29, I'm left with the same impression.

For example, in the "military" loop, the MC is an officer of some sort, whose goal is to defeat a bunch of terrorists in a cult who want to attack the MC's country. But we aren't given almost any details about the country, the cult, the military, or even the duties of the rank that the MC occupies.

And, for a story supposedly about a person who has to overcome his difficulty socializing with people... I never get the impression (after the first school loop that he spends re-acclimating to being around people, anyway) that he has any trouble at all socializing with people. And, while I agree with other comments here that there are no stakes, I don't think that's a result of the time loop, so much as the MC hasn't had any really difficult problems to face (i.e. ones that can't be overcome by either sheer necromantic power or just by keeping his head down) since he was hunted down at that party.

Again, it's not badly-written, but, based on what's been released to date, I just have no desire to seek it out again and read more when it continues.

** I just discovered this yesterday or the day before and I am well and truly hooked. It really is Mother of Learning with +blackjack and hookers+ necromancy and scenarios. But it's just so damned intriguing I can't not follow.
