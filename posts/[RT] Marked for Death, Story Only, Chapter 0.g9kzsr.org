** MfD has had chapters posted here before, but never the start of the story. The link is to the story-only thread; the main thread is here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/]]

Quick summary:

This can be read as a linear story but it's a quest, an interactive medium where after each chapter the readers vote on what the protagonist should do. It's 1.6 million words and has run for four years, two chapters per week.

It's a rationalized version of Naruto with a healthy dose of death world mixed in -- ninja shouting spells at each other while dealing with the fact that everything around them is made of murder.

Rationalizing Naruto required enough changes that canon knowledge is not required and may in some cases get in the way -- it certainly has for the players, despite being warned.

The protagonist is Hazō, a newly-graduated ninja from the Village Hidden in the Mist who is sent on a suicide mission along with a large task force. The task force runs for it and sets out to establish a new village of their own, the Village Hidden in the Swamp, where the Swamp in question is a lethal hellpit of danger and vicious animals. Plus, it's right between two of the most powerful nations in the world.

The new village is soon destroyed and Hazō, his two teammates, and their teacher go on the road as missing-nin, struggling to stay one step ahead of the greatest hunter-nin in the world. Along the way they rampage around, upset international geopolitics at least twice, acquire the Pangolin Summoning Scroll, become a ruling clan of the most powerful ninja village in the world, and barely squeak out a victory (i.e. survival) against multiple demigods.

** Started reading this a while back, just picked it up again. I'm loving the story and the characters! Somehow I thought the story was over already, but it seems that it's still updating. Is there an end in mind or will the story progress as long as players keep playing?

** Finally getting around to this. Thanks for your work!

Is there a way to read this from the beginning NOT in Story Only and have it make sense?

I enjoy following along with the discussion, voting, rolls, and whatnot but it seems like almost all the context has been removed. I'm not seeing vote tallies or voting instructions and the ruleset laid out in the initial post seems to be different from what was used back then. I've read ten or twelve pages (non consecutive) of the first 35 pages and I'm rather confused.

Edit: looks like I should have read further. Starting to see everything after a couple of chapters
