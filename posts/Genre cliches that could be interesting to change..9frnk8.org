** zombie fiction ends in one of three ways: either the problem is solved shortly after the outbreak (shaun of the dead, for example), or the world is broken by it and the zombies are the new normal (too many to list), or the world is broken but the problem ends somehow and people get back to rebuilding.

the same sort of thing can happen with vampires, but looks very different with intelligent vampires. the basic problem is that most zombie stories are not about zombies, they are just using zombies as a plot device to tell a story about people being terrible to eachother and acting like idiots in a natural disaster. the real threat in any zombie movie is not the zombies, its the other survivors. the zombies are just a natural disaster to explain why so many people are gone so your own your own with a few friends in a hostile urban enviroment.

end goal isnt a problem- your just saying you dont like a world where the normal has changed forever and wont change back. the first goal is 'dont die', the second goal is to rebuild society in the face of the new normal. any time a zombie movie shows a new society however its as a parody, a strawman of a city thats only there to be destroyed later. zombie movies have the problem that they seem to exist only to show how certain ideas the author dislikes are bad. and while one character may be rational, all the others are examples of stupidity and failure states. because the story is all about failure states.

** My favorite zombie story is "Dead Eyes Open", where the zombies are still just whoever they were, they're just metabolically challenged... and are trying to make do in a world where part of the population is going "New minority group, gotta help them." and part is going "Headshot! Pow!" and most are going "WTF"?
