** I know it's been posted here before, but in case some people haven't realized yet, this is a /really good/ Worm fanfic that /definitely/ deserves the read. Intelligent characters of all levels (1, 2, and 3) abound, and halfway through there's one of the best examples of a solvable mystery I've ever seen (that doesn't come from HPMoR). I debated with myself a little about whether to add the [RST] tag to a story whose author didn't explicitly claim it to be a rationalist tale, but the themes of the story are just so, so strongly rationalist that in the end I felt it was deserved.

If you're new to this story, give it a read. And if you're not... well, here's your reminder that it updated.

*EDIT:* There's also an UNSONG reference halfway through one of the new chapters, so hey.

*** Not sure i'd call it "really good". The way she immediatly becomes completely overpowered ( the precog aspect of her power felt very forced ) is very unsatisfying for a story. And she easely befriends cauldron, the protectorate, director pigot and deals with coil in the first few chapter, which is kind of ridiculous... Only read it to page 32 before droping it, so maybe it gets better, but so far havn't seen anything to distinguish it from the miriade other power-fantasy-worm-fanfic.

**** There's no such thing as a character being "overpowered" in an absolute sense, only characters that are overpowered relative to the obstacles presented to them. Taylor in this story shares the same goals as Cauldron does, and therefore faces the same stakes: the complete obliteration of /thousands of parallel Earths/. You complain about Coil being dealt with so easily, but the point is that this is /not an average Wormfic/. Coil is not Taylor's opponent here the same way he was in canon or in many less ambitious Worm stories; in fact, he's not even a blip on her radar. With how much overwhelming force the enemy has at their disposal, for Taylor to have as much power as she does--the backing of Cauldron, etc.--is a /necessity/. It's also worth noting that some background parts of the setting have been changed as well, purely to make the cycle that much more efficient and difficult to stop--and in this sense, too, the story follows rationalist lines. To quote Eliezer Yudkowsky:

#+begin_quote
  Rule One: If you do anything to increase the protagonist's power, or make their life easier, you must also amplify their opponent or add extra difficulties to their life. *You can't make Frodo a Jedi unless you give Sauron the Death Star.* Otherwise, even if it is well-written in all other ways, your story will suck because the reader will know to expect an unending string of easy victories, leading them to neither wonder or care about what happens next. The Mary Sue is not defined by her power being too strong, but by her challenges being too easily overcome.

***** It's funny you quoting yud, cause this is exactly what i was thinking about about when i wrote my comment, hopefully this means we come from the same understanding of what makes good fiction...

I don't think i have ever claimed tailor was overpowered "in an absolute sense". on the contrary, i truly think she is overpowered compared to everything around her. Kindly point to the death star equivalent Tailor faces (in the first 32 page, obviously, as i haven't read further and maybe the writting style and tone completely changes after that). As far as i could tell, everything goes her way and setbacks are either ridiculously tiny or temporary:

-she gets a power that identifies shadow stalker's indentity instantly, as well as coil and everyone else. -she get's recruted by cauldron, and becomes instant good friend with the most powerfull precog, doctor, and number man. - she instantly solves eidolon's issue, making him indebted to her. -any plan she makes just always work perfectly on the first try (like the plan to antagonize shadow stalker to make friend with the protectorate, or the fight with the other protectorate team, or the plan to give piggot superpower to bring her to her side) -her father just accepts all this without more than a small talk. -she can make heroe's stuff work. -She becomes precog after one week sparing with contessa. -she understands how to make formula cape perfectly after a week of late night work, in barrely a couple chapter.

Yeah, no death star.

It could well be that eventually she does meet a strong adversary (but the way the beginning of this story goes makes me doubt she would struggles for more than 1 paragraph) but the trivially easy begining makes the story boring until we get there.

There is the threat of scion, but it is distant. How would you feel about a story of jedi frodo, smashing everything with ease for most of the story, while sauron has a deathstar being constructed but not ready until 5 to 15 years.

****** I am the OP, and I think I understand your complaint. To start things off, let me address the last part of your post, since I think it neatly encapsulates our disagreement:

#+begin_quote
  How would you feel about a story of jedi frodo, smashing everything with ease for most of the story, while sauron has a deathstar being constructed but not ready until 5 to 15 years.
#+end_quote

I realize this is meant as a rhetorical question, but I'll answer anyway. I'd be absolutely fine with such a story, /as long as Frodo knows and understands that Sauron needs to be stopped before he completes his Death Star and all of his actions are geared toward achieving that end/. If he just goes around "smashing everything" and winning a bunch of smaller battles that don't really matter until, boom, 15 years later Sauron blows up Middle Earth, then yeah, I wouldn't be very happy with that story--but not because the threat was distant. I'd dislike the story because the protagonist was an idiot who /didn't prioritize stopping Sauron over winning a bunch of smaller conflicts/.

Again, you seem to be viewing this as a story in which Taylor's obstacles are meant to be other parahumans--which, to be fair, many of them are, since this is still a Worm fanfic we're talking about. But unlike most Worm fanfics (and arguably, Worm itself), the overarching, /core/ conflict of the story is always about stopping Scion and the cycle, from the very first chapter onward. Taylor, who recognizes this, takes only those steps which forward Cauldron's goal--she removed Coil, not because she was appalled at what he did to Lisa, but because he presented a hurdle to that goal. (Of course, like everyone else, she too is prone to making mistakes, and that comes up later in the story, but I feel like that's not your core disagreement, which is why this is merely a parenthetical note.)

So, with this perspective in mind, let's take a look at the list of things you felt was "too easy" for her:

#+begin_quote
  -she gets a power that identifies shadow stalker's indentity instantly, as well as coil and everyone else.
#+end_quote

See, this sort of thing is what I would characterize as irrelevant. Shadow Stalker plays a (minor) role in the story for all of two chapters before disappearing again because in the larger context, /she is not and has never been important/. Taylor has so many more important things on her plate that Shadow Stalker is a non-entity; complaining about her (or Coil) is like complaining that the Frodo swatted a mosquito at some point during his journey, all while Sauron was slowly completing his Death Star.

#+begin_quote
  -she get's recruted by cauldron, and becomes instant good friend with the most powerfull precog, doctor, and number man.
#+end_quote

So, uh, I'm not exactly sure what your beef with this part is, since it really has nothing to do with your main objection? Like, she's getting along with her new co-workers, so what? She got along just fine with the Undersiders in canon after joining up too. If your complaint is just that Cauldron is too /important/ and that having them be cozying up to her so early on in the story is jarring, fine. But that's subjective, which means you still can't really use that as ammunition against the story's /plot/.

#+begin_quote
  - she instantly solves eidolon's issue, making him indebted to her.
#+end_quote

Same response as above.

#+begin_quote
  -any plan she makes just always work perfectly on the first try (like the plan to antagonize shadow stalker to make friend with the protectorate, or the fight with the other protectorate team, or the plan to give piggot superpower to bring her to her side)
#+end_quote

If you read on in the story, you'll find that this is simply false, and that some of Taylor's early shenanigans actually lead to /considerable/ repercussions later on in the story. But fine, I acknowledge this at least as a complaint that could conceivably get a reader to stop reading the story before it became obvious that it wasn't a fix-everything power-fantasy. Still, if you yourself only got so far into the story before quitting, I don't think you should be quite so confident in making this kind of assertion (that every one of Taylor's plans goes right).

#+begin_quote
  -her father just accepts all this without more than a small talk.
#+end_quote

Again, irrelevant. Danny is about as important in this story as Shadow Stalker--which is to say, he's there to provide an emotional foundation for Taylor's character, and that's about it.

#+begin_quote
  -she can make heroe's stuff work.
#+end_quote

Um, what?

#+begin_quote
  -She becomes precog after one week sparing with contessa. -she understands how to make formula cape perfectly after a week of late night work, in barrely a couple chapter.
#+end_quote

Now, I grouped these last two complaints together because I felt that these, above all, represent actual problems with the story. As [[/u/eaglejarl]] said, Taylor often gets powerups that are never really foreshadowed, meaning that the story sometimes violates Sanderson's First Law, and I agree that this detracts from its "rationality score". It's been something that I willingly looked past since the rest of the story was so impressive, but yeah, not a good thing.

But the impression I've been getting from you is that you mainly dislike how "easy" Taylor has it, and that's the illusion that I've been aiming to deconstruct in this comment. Taylor's life is only easy if you focus so hard on the little things that you miss the big picture--that lurking threat of destruction that's always there in the background, that most people never even get a glimpse of, and that Taylor is staring /dead in the face/ every day of her life.

In short, no, this is not a fix-fic. This is not a power-fantasy. I can understand that you subjectively dislike how the beginning of the story played out, and I can even understand how you might mistake it for some kind of power-fantasy fix-fic early on. But ultimately, it really isn't either of those things, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't bill it /as/ those things, at least without reading it all the way through.

Does El-Ahrairah have problems? Of course it does. Does that make it some kind of power-fantasy? No, it definitely doesn't.

******* u/eaglejarl:
#+begin_quote
  There's no such thing as a character being "overpowered" in an absolute sense, only characters that are overpowered relative to the obstacles presented to them.
#+end_quote

I think you're generally right, but I would quibble a bit: the more powerful a character is, the harder it is to give them meaningful challenges and the harder it is for the audience to identify with them. That's why most of Superman's plotlines devolve to "and then the bad guy got kryptonite so Superman wasn't powerful any more" or "and then Lois got kidnapped, which is a type of problem where Superman isn't powerful because his powers don't apply."

Regardless, the problem with ElAh is that Taylor is overpowered compared to the challenges she is seen to be facing in the first XX,000 words of the story. Yes, there are bigger challenges on the horizon /but they are on the horizon/. What's on the page is what matters most.

Saying it differently: imagine that I gave you a trilogy of books, each one a million words long. The first novel (remember, 1M words) has the hero steamroll every problem with ease. There's no challenge, no real relationships are formed, and the hero never has any moments of self-doubt or emotional difficulty. I promise that in the third book he's going to fight a really big Big Bad and it's going to be really hard, but the entire first book has nothing in it to engage you. Would you keep reading all the way to the end of the first novel? Would you read the second?

Obviously I'm being hyperbolic when I talk about novels a million words long, but it should make the point. Most of us are perfectly willing to read a thousand words of curbstomp victories before the real challenges start. Most of us are NOT willing to read a million words of curbstomp victories before the real challenges start. Somewhere in between a thousand and a million there is a number of words where people say "not enough challenge for too long; I'm out." That number will be different for different people, and clearly yours is extremely high. Mine, and apparently [[/u/Towerowl]]'s, is much lower.

For the record: I don't recall exactly where I dropped out, but I definitely read several tens of thousands of words, so the argument "well, you didn't read far enough" isn't going to convince me.

On the question of Eidolon vs Shadow Stalker: I would agree that Taylor instantly identifying Shadow Stalker isn't a big deal. Shadow Stalker is not significant to the plot, has no redeeming features that make us care about her, never solves or causes any problems, and isn't powerful enough to be important in the setting. Anyone who hadn't already read Worm would consider her appearance a waste of words; the only reason it's useful to have her onscreen here is to give Worm fans closure.

On the other hand, Eidolon /is/ important. He appears repeatedly, is very sympathetic, solves various problems, and is enormously powerful in the setting. Instantly gaining his trust and help is another powerup, and powerups should not be gained as easily as Taylor gains this one. They especially should not be gained using an ability that is not foreshadowed at all.

#+begin_quote
  Danny is about as important in this story as Shadow Stalker--which is to say, he's there to provide an emotional foundation for Taylor's character, and that's about it.
#+end_quote

See, this is a problem. If Danny is there to provide an emotional foundation, he doesn't do that. Taylor barely thinks about him, and she should. In canon her relationship with her father was a big deal; it provided some pathos and made her much more sympathetic. Here, her relationship is literally "I need to save the world and you don't matter enough for me to make time with you." She doesn't need him the way canon!Taylor did, or the way any 15-year-old should need their (loving, caring) parent. Her relationship with Danny was a great opportunity to give her a real challenge and the author didn't take it.

****** If you read the story with an ear to the ground, you'd realize that Jack Slash will become the main foil when he enters the story. Taylor's power is basically a literate version of Broadcast and sparks fly when they finally meet!

The story IS a fix-fic where problems are solved rapidly (but often imperfectly which comes up later) BUT unlike most Mary Sue fix-fics, this one is written with loving care to the core content and a deep understanding of side characters that aren't given a chance in the original... a few qualities that make it an engrossing read in my opinion. This author has captured the music of the Interlude with all the right notes.

******* Then I guess we just have different taste in fiction, and there's little point arguing about it. I prefer a weak protagonist who manages to get by despite his disdvantage, rather than a senseless rapide escalation of power for both protagonist and antagonist.

And you seem not to mind having to go through a vast periode at the beginning of the story during which nothing threatens the protagonist.

I cann't say i understand how you can enjoy it, but if you do then there really isn't anything i can do to change your subjective experience even assuming i'd want to.

So it comes down to: you recomend this story, i recomend against this story. We both feel our own reason expressed in the conversation trump the other's and now we're just talking past each other. As much as i hate disagreing with someone (as that suggest that one of us is wrong and i don't want to be wrong), this is both very subjective and low stakes, so how about leaving it at that?

******** For what it's worth, I agree with every objection you made and will add another of my own: Taylor's character. It is completely different from canon and, honestly, there isn't much there. She isn't an uncertain 15-year-old girl, she is the Grey Lensman -- always confident, always knowing the right answer, always completely understanding why people are doing what they're doing, never really angry at her opponents but just a little disappointed that they're getting in her way instead of helping. It gets dull fast.

Here's a second one: she develops new powers as the plot demands, often without warning. She starts off with "see a text description of someone's power and interpret it". Not long after she adds "understand the person's motivations and intent". Then "combat precog". Then "push her emotions into her power well enough that she can fool Alexandria's body-reading". Then "run simulations of herself and talk to them and shift sensory feeds between herself and them to avoid nausea-inducement and they are always fine with being turned off even though they fully understand that that means they die".

Someone used the term "competence porn" to describe The Good Student and El-Alrairah scratches a similar itch as a fix-fic. I suspect OP and I both feel that the underlying sentiment of "if you think hard enough, you can overcome the challenges ahead" is a primary reason why we find El-Ahlrairah fun to read.

******** I actually agree with a lot of your points -- don't confuse me for the OP.

El-A is not good as a stand-alone product since it relies on a parallel progression alongside the original to drive the story along. It was disrupted by deviations (a duel with the LV team, no leviathan) which really threw off my sense of knowing where the story's is headed. The threat of Scion ending the world as we know it is a threat enough for me, and if the point of the story is to see a know-it-all trying to coordinate shards rather than drive them into conflict, then I'm fine not seeing her in mortal danger in each chapter.

For me, the story is an optimization game where the author throws Taylor into situations and she Thinks her way out of it.
