--------------

Finally compiled all the Fi-posts into Zelda journal entries. Yey. Website is now the sole source of canon.

Hopefully the journal entries aren't too dry. I tried to give some new perspective from Zelda that might also help with research going forward.

--------------

This chapter was written collaboratively with MMKII with copyediting by Kurkistan.


** Plan Learn by Doing:

Link Actions:

- Link ain't afraid of no ghost! Diplomacy might work on Ibosso.
- While en-route work with Fi to refine use of the Circular Stone Disk aoe detection, using the Transfabrulator as an example of something to detect. Also complete her own version of the same aoe effect, using at most 1000 VP to complete both items. Since Ibosso is such an old legend, there might be some more artifacts to find.
- If there's time, review the 3 combat manuals. Focus on if there are techniques that are unknown to Link and the trio. Plus if there's any instructions on using the Transfabrulator or fighting Stalfos/voidspawn. And anything on ghostbusting.
- Ask Fi if she thinks marking additional people will increase the cost of marking someone. If no, mark Koja because she's the healer. If yes, wait to mark whoever bonds with the power fragment. If maybe, spend 100 vp marking koja to get an estimate of how much it would cost. All assuming koja's willing to be marked.\\

Zelda Actions:

- Naibi didn't know much about Ibosso, but are there other members of the tribe that know more about him? Maybe some elderly members?
- Try to listen in on the meeting between Taetus and Shesan. If they rip into each other, it might be entertaining and if your two least favorite people in the world, Hylia forbid, /get along/ that's good to know as well.
- Resume the regular meetings with the Council. Inform them that thanks to the blessings she received from Hylia, Link was initiated into the Lightsworn. Spreading this news would hopefully improve the country's morale (and it's going to spread anyway since everyone in her traveling party knows it happened). How should she best announce it?
- Once back in Castletown, arrange to meet with Vestele in person, because of the sensitive nature, to request that the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using Sacrifice for power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself and harm Hyrule. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP. Shesan also claimed that the Niesis /incident/ released sealed Fae, so they might want to be on the look out for active Fae too. Finally, are the Seekers are aware of other ancient evils that Ganondorf could potentially unleash?
- If the Zora members of the Order of Sages (or other Zora) are willing and able, have them give Zelda a crash course on speaking the Zora language. Mainly for Fi to understand the language. Read them in on Fi's existence and her language ability if needed to convince them.
- When some blin have been captured, they might talk to each other if confined together. Zelda and Fi can listen in to learn the blin language. If her advisors have other ideas about how to get blin prisoners to talk, that would be lovely.
- Ask Lensa for her help in getting a short list of suitable consorts. Besides Link.

*** As written, the section :

#+begin_quote
  If she travels outside of Castletown again for diplomacy or research, having a third marked that stays in the country would be very useful as the Zora crisis proved. Wymar, or shudder Taetus might be suitable choices. On the bright side, it would give her an excuse to grill Taetus on his motivations before agreeing to marking him.
#+end_quote

reads a bit unclear to me insofar as "What is the intended action for Zelda to actually take as a result of this bullet." but others' mileage may vary. It could mean a variety of things to me, including "Ruminate about possible candidates for the next Marked (insert more guided and directed thoughts thoughts thoughts). Definitely (!!!)don't do anything yet.", "Ruminate about possible candidates, (But Do Something as a result if Zelda decides.)" and also possibly (though I am picking up signaled intent for this interpretation much less strongly than the other two) "Think about some stuff, then Go Mark Taetus."

In general: You all may want to avoid (potential) vagaries like that if the meaning isn't overwhelmingly clear from context, at least when it comes to important items on your checklist. It could help to highlight which actions specifically you'd like taken, or prefacing thought prompts and scaffolding for characters with "Zelda thinks about Thing:", "Zelda negotiates with Dumbbutt:: Appeal to common interests and highlight advantages with cold utilitarian logic.", and "Link kills seemingly invincible StayPuft Monster: (Insert how he does that in a clever cool way)" or something or the sort.

Ignore any and all of that if its just something where what action you'd like the characters to take is clear ("Go read the books!") and/or you want to leave specifics up to the character ("Link: Go kill stuff!") or its something where the specifics are something you don't really care about one way or another ("Zelda does relaxing stuff for 24 hours.") vs. 1000 variations on how specifically Zelda must optimally relax in the bestest way possible,

Just pointing this out in advance, since illusion of transparency is very much a thing from time to time within the general topic of "quests and action plans for them." I /don't/ feel like this has been a super large issue so far in any way, but I'd like to point it out just to get ahead of any potential future ones so that we don't end up in some awkward scenario as a result of a misunderstanding.

*** I'm super late to discussion, but I'm not sure about the math for marking a fighter if we're eventually going to have a marked that stays in castletown (Which I STRONGLY support. I also think it should be Taetus for several reasons*). I'm not super against marking sheikah, I just have some doubts.

Also, as Cariyaga's been saying, I hope Ibosso can be approached and resolved without fighting.

Other than that (heh) I approve of this plan.

*Not getting into them since we're not marking him this update.

*** It looks like your plan is going to win at this point, but I'm going to make one quick request: Can we mark one of the sheikah near Link? I'd like to accrue the VP we would earn from any heroism they'd do in our upcoming ghost busting, and I think it's wise to start earning VP more quickly in general.

We have a lot of VP right now, and I think investing some in a third mark is a wise expenditure. The earlier we do it, the better, and we're just about to get a chance for a possible spike in earnings. A Mark could help improve our chances of surviving if there are significant combat threats, too.

(I'd also advise we work toward marking all three of them eventually, as noted in my own post.)

** +*Voting time!*+ E: Voting is closed.

Zelda is 1 day away from Castletown and Link & co. are 2 days away from the location indicated by a Gerudo navigator in the caravan who was familiar with the area.

*What do you do next?*

- Ibosso the Damned? I ain't afraid of no ghost!

- Keep ignoring Ja'bu and maybe he'll go away?

- [X] No seriously, do /all/ the research

- Zelda's only a day away from Castletown and she isn't seeing any flames yet. It's probably fine. Stop to take a bath in Lake Hylia and admire the scenery.

- BLIN DEATH CULT

- Wait, wasn't there a fragment in the Lost Woods or something?

- Other (write-in)

Your previous VP total was 10419 VP.

Fi spent:

- 32 VP on telepathic communications

- 40 VP on four intangible avatars

- 50 VP on research towards "Scalable Empowerment"

Chapter 19 spanned 4 days. During that time, you earned 135 VP from Zelda and 163 VP from Link.

You have earned an additional 121 VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus. Total: 484.

*You currently have 11079 VP.*

** [Plan: Who You Gonna Call?]

Elements of this plan are borrowed shamelessly from [[/u/Mathematicae]], but I'm focusing on prioritizing prep for the ghosts.

Link Actions:

- Study the training manuals, prioritizing sections on ghosts, spiritual entities, and anything in regards to Lightsworn powers.
- If there's anything in regard to Lighsworn powers that Link could potentially practice that he hasn't already been practicing, practice it if currently makes sense to do so.
- While en-route work with Fi to refine use of the Circular Stone Disk aoe detection, using the Transfabrulator as an example of something to detect. Also complete her own version of the same aoe effect, using at most 1000 VP to complete both items. Since Ibosso is such an old legend, there might be some more artifacts to find.
- Mark Koja. The intent here is to get a third marked before we engage in potential combat with ghosts, which may generate increased VP for heroism, as well as have significant dangers that may require powerful healing (or energy blasts, if normal weapons don't work on ghosts). Explain that we intend to mark all three sheikah with us eventually, but that we are prioritizing marking the healer first so she can make use of Fi's mana transfer immediately in emergencies.

Link Tests:

Ignore these if they are already presumed to be covered by the training he did in the previous update.

- Test if you can make yourself float or fly.
- Test to see if you have stronger wind blast capabilities.
- Test if you can imbue a weapon with wind.

Zelda Actions:

- Ask gerudo tribe members that Naibi recommends more about Ibosso, and if there are any Gerduo traditions indicating what might be necessary to free him from his cursed state. Basically, anything that might offer clues to resolve Ibosso's situation that can be conveyed to Link.
- Get orders to whoever is appropriate to capture a few blin so Fi can study their language.
- Resume the regular meetings with the Council. Inform them that thanks to the blessings she received from Hylia, Link was initiated into the Lightsworn. Spreading this news would hopefully improve the country's morale (and it's going to spread anyway since everyone in her traveling party knows it happened). How should she best announce it?

This is deliberately brief (especially on Zelda's side) with the intent of trying to make it easier for the QMs to write. Hopefully this will be an easy update, then we can focus the next one on ghost fighting for Link and research for Zelda.

Might want to rephrase that to 'ask old grandma/grandpa Gerudo for traditions about Ibosso. Naibi already said all she knew. Totally stealing this btw.

** I'd strongly prefer to make preparations to mark Taetus in addition to whatever else we may be doing.

In addition, I'd like to do work on capturing a number of blin in preparation for our work with the Blin Death Cult, should that prove efficacious.

** Since fi can learn laguages of marked people more easily In the future if we manage to capture a blin and have lots of vp we might want to mark it to learn their language which might be very strategically useful. And we can either convince the blin to work whith us as a spy or just let it free(or pretend it escaped) and have fi spy on it through the mark without it knowing.
