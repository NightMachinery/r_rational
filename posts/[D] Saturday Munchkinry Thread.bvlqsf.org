Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** I've posted before about the low-magic D&D campaign I'm running. I'm about to give my party their first real magic haul, and I want to run the items by you fine folks to make sure there are no game-breaking combos or hidden uses.

- Two Wands of Mold Earth, as the cantrip. 3 charges/day, wand explodes if brought below 1 charge.

- One Auger of Stonedrill, an oooold spell I found in a splashbook. Lets you make a 10' diameter tunnel through rock (but not earth, wood or metal) at a rate of 5 feet/round. The rubble still needs to be dealt with. Has 5 rounds of charge/day, explodes if brought below 1.

- One Talisman of Unseen Servant. A paperweight that can be activated to cast Unseen Servant for up to 3 hours a day.

- One Dagger of Extension, which ups its damage die on each hit until it reaches greataxe damage (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d12). At full extension, after 4 hits, it also becomes a +1 magic weapon.

- One Ring of Slow Metabolism. Halves the metabolic speed of the wearer, doubling time needed between meals and the length of time they can go in extreme temperatures or without sleep before taking levels of exhaustion. Also doubles the amount of time poison or disease takes to do harm. Wearing it for more than three days causes 1 level of exhaustion per day over 3 when it is removed.

Go to town! My players aren't huge munchkins, but I want to make sure there are no crazy interactions here.

*** Dunno exactly what you'd consider a "hidden use", but:

Stone Drill /effectively/ destroys stone, since changing an area of solid stone to an area of [[https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Stone_Drill_(5e_Spell]["fine gravel"]]) involves reducing the amount of stone. Casting it straight down would automatically create a pit at the top as the gravel falls.

Mould Earth says "portion of dirt or stone" within a 5 foot cube, and allows you to instantly relocate "loose earth". If that works on fine gravel, you can instantly clear out your pitfall and make it even deeper, or clear a cylinder of gravel beneath the enemies feet and trap them within, or just clear out the rubble from a normal horizontal Stone Drill tunnel. (You'd probably need to carry around a shovel to reach bedrock in the first place, but it's usually not that deep in most places, and deep pitfalls are a good at area denial or taking enemies out of fights)

Depending on what "natural rock" is defined as, Stone Drill could destroy the gemstones in people's jewelry.

Have the person with Mould Earth carry around coal dust, and use the instant relocation to place the dust particles in a high surface area space filling curve to trigger dust explosions.

*** Between the Mold Earth and Stonedrill, excavation and breaching traditional fortifications should become a lot easier for the party:

- The party could bypass rooms in dungeons or other challenges by tunnelling around them. Robbing stone buildings would also be easier, although the method would be rather visible and distinctive.
- The party's items could be very valuable in a siege for breaking through castle walls or tunnelling under them. Since it's a low-magic setting, I'd assume countermeasures to these spells are rare.
- If there are spare charges at the end of the day that can be used without exploding the items, I'd probably use them to set up traps or fortifications around the campsite, like pits or walls.

I think there are plenty of threads online for imaginative uses of Unseen Servants. The main ones that spring to mind are setting off traps and reloading weapons like crossbows in combat, and out of combat performing mindless but valuable work like copying books.

I assume the Dagger of Extension returns to normal after a while? This is obviously useful for situations where weapons are limited, a dagger would be a lot easier to sneak past guards. A player might try to argue for getting advantage by surprising their opponent with the extension effect in combat, which might be overpowered for a rogue. I'd also want to be ready to shut down someone asking for extra damage because it extends in the wound. The main consideration here I can think of is what qualifies as a 'hit': if you sneak the dagger in, can you bash objects with it repeatedly to get it up to full length before you enter combat, or does it require live targets? If I want to keep it as a magic weapon, can I drag the tip along the ground so it keeps 'hitting' as I walk?

If the Ring of Slow Metabolism affects all metabolism, there are a few other uses I can think of:

- Win drinking contests by doubling how long it takes alcohol to affect you.
- Hold your breath for twice as long, for underwater exploration.
- This would be very useful for hunting and tracking, and could make for a scary pursuit predation-style enemy, maybe a ranger of some sort?

To avoid the downsides, I'd want to arrange a routine of taking it off before going to bed and lending it to whoever's on watch, and probably having a similar system with meals and the like, to avoid the exhaustion for keeping it on too long.

**** Solid ideas. I absolutely intend for them to use it for creative dungeoneering, and 25ft/day of tunneling + debris clearing doesn't feel gamebreaking to me. Watch out for other things that like to tunnel through stone. Your other two points re: Stonedrill are also creative, but not game-breaking.

Dagger returns to normal at a rate of 1 damage die per round unused, and must be used on a hostile living (or undead/construct) target.

Love those uses of the ring. As for the scary enemy, you mean one who's tracking them and not giving them time to sleep or hunt, so they have to pass the ring around to survive? That's a fucking terrifying and great idea.

*** Yeah, so the only one of those magic items that has some really strong "out of the box thinking" advantages is the stonedrill.

Although I wouldn't even call the advantages to be "hidden uses" or anything. It is just the straight up intended usecase of the drill.

There are 2 major usecases for "tunneling" spells and abilities. The first usecase, is to just tunnel around any obstacle that gets put in your way.

Magic puzzle in a dungeon that opens the door? Screw that! Tunnel around it, through the wall! Trying to break into a house/castle? Tunnel! And really just any sort of dungeon, if you put something in their way, that isn't clawing there face out, well you just hit the tunnel button and make the obstacle trivial.

The 2nd main usecase for "tunneling" abilities is destruction. A 10 foot diameter, 5 foot deep hole is kind of a big hole. You said that it only works on rock, so I guess thats a bit of a limiting factor here. But any stone-like structure of moderate size, or anything with a stone foundation, could possibly be collapsed using a single use of this item.

**** I don't have the book on me to check, but I'm fairly certain it specifies non-magical stone. I might just build a combat use into the item though, give a stone enemy a CON save to avoid loads of damage.

The dagger reverts to normal at a rate of one die per round unused. So that would work, but you'd better turn right around and use it on your real target or it'll shrink.
