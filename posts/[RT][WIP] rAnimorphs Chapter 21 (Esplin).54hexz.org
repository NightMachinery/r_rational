** The start of this chapter stands alongside the end of [[http://hpmor.com/chapter/104][Chapter 104 in HPMOR]] as a masterful expression of thought as plot. This, above all else, is why I read rational fic, and all I can say is that this story continues, improbably, to impress me at every turn. That this is paired with my favorite exploration in fiction of the Simulation Hypothesis -- AS AN ASIDE IN A RANDOM CHAPTER, while managing not to feel shoehorned in or at all out of place -- is just showing off.

Somehow, seeing Esplin as more alien than ever has "humanized" him for me. He isn't just an antagonist worthy of Tobias and those other people (kidding...), but an actively awesome component of the story, elevating it to new heights. Quirrell was this, but I don't think HPMOR ever quite manages to unify and juxtapose his appeal as a dark rationalist and his stark, empty, amorality. I'm pretty sure Esplin is cooler regardless, and he manages to be awesome and inspiring and super evil (or at least critically flawed) ALL AT THE SAME TIME. His last enemy is death -- what a badass.

Esplin has resources and intelligence far surpassing those of the heroes, and he's playing the game on a level commensurate with that advantage. Earlier in the story this meant that he was making plans imperfectly tailored to his enemies, prudently allowing that they may have the resources/intelligence/experience to make them a serious threat. This made sense, and gave the Animorphs a chance, but it wasn't until now that we really saw the level at which Esplin is operating.

He encounters (I think) the complement and price of the Animorphs' rescue, but divine intervention doesn't make him feel small or insignificant, for all that it shakes him. He simply updates on the expanded scope of the board and the appearance of new player(s), considers the implications, and makes the best move available. It doesn't change all that much for one already intending to walk the path toward godhood.

Esplin totally outclasses the protagonists, as far as I can tell, but the awesome thing is that this doesn't mean he is going to win. If Earth were really all he wanted, I don't think the Animorphs would stand a chance, but just winning Earth (WIN_EARTH), without meeting a bunch of other conditions, isn't really much of a victory for him relative to his goals (WIN_ALL), so he'll (correctly) end up taking actions that reduce the probability that he gains control of Earth (P(WIN_EARTH & WIN_ALL) + P(WIN_EARTH & !(WIN_ALL)) if they increase the probability of a perfect victory (P(WIN_EARTH & WIN_ALL)). (So, like, he'll be happy to move probability mass from the second term there to the first, even if the transfer is lossy/negative-sum and worsens his chances overall.) For example, he might pursue high variance strategies in which he directs his resources away from Earth and towards his other concerns. He won't be holding the Idiot Ball, and it will only be a Deus Ex Machina in the literal sense, and the Animorphs may actually, somehow, stand a chance.

[[/u/TK17Studios]] mentioned some time ago the work he put in to reconcile the scope of the Animorphs Universe with the literary (esp. Rat!Fic) requirement of protagonists with real agency. He positioned the pieces and balanced the scales such that even though the Animorphs' contribution would be necessarily small in relative terms, it would nonetheless be the deciding factor, or a deciding factor, at least plausibly, at least maybe.

This is better, of course, than the alternative in which the scales are balanced in such a way that the universe will be fine regardless of what the Animorphs do, or one in which the Animorphs end up losing despite perfect play, but it still felt like a compromise to me at the time. Like TK17 had set things up as well as he could while still being fair, and that the progress of the serial would be an extended collective evaluation of exactly how heavy each piece really was. Like, since he didn't know at the start everything that would happen, the process of writing the story was just thinking about it more and seeing whether he had balanced things "correctly" after all. If after all of that the Animorphs win, it ends up feeling about as empty as the obviously imbalanced scenarios mentioned above. The author set down the pieces, and it turns out the Animorphs sat on the weightier side of the scale.

But that isn't quite what's going on. The Animorphs don't have a set weight, a contribution they can make that is narrowly bounded by their status as unreasonably smart teenagers with superpowers. Esplin doesn't have a set weight either. He's powerful and competent, but he's playing for everything and he's intent on making enemies and he's kind of insane. The Animorphs could play extraordinarily well, and still lose; they're teenagers and he's a monster, some non-negligible fraction of a god. It would be absurd for them to win.

And yet, if they find the right path, and become the right shape, it is entirely possible for them to lose Esplin his larger game, or navigate towards victory within a margin of risk that he is forced to accept in service of a true victory.

Ellimist, and Crayak, and TK17 did some simulations, and have a sense of what will happen, but it turns out that this is a complex and chaotic system, with outcomes that can diverge wildly on a dime.

Somehow, there's hope.

At least... I think that's what is happening -- correct me where I'm wrong. Also the Yeerks keep getting more and more interesting, and those bird things are cool.

Anyway, TK17, this chapter is wonderful; I'd say not to change anything, but I trust your judgment better than mine.

Kudos, and looking forward to more.

** Nice.

I like how Visser 3 starts madly speculating about what countermeasures Telor might have prepared, then realizes Telor doesn't have any.

I'd expect to change that soon, though. I think Esplin is making a mistake by trying to outsmart Telor. They're a hive mind with a lot of humans who have every reason to distrust Visser 3. Trying to get anything past Telor is trying to get it past many different people, with different perspectives, including some who watched James Bond movies, and that one guy who watched Star Wars III and will go "Hey, maybe we should try to guard against order 66". Visser imposing a dichotomy with a deadline probably didn't go unnoticed either.

Speaking of which, I'd be really interested int the POVs of the humans/controllers in the room. Miss Telor's spokeswoman with a throne made of yeerks probably had a very interesting experience, for instance. And by interesting, I mean traumatic. And by traumatic, I mean interesting!

*** I, too, would be interested in some of the controller/human perspectives in the room, especially that of the spokespeople. I agree, Telor can farm a lot of information from the human perspectives in the room, create a crowdsourced counter to the Visser's intellect.

Telor's aggressiveness will probably not help it though, as the Visser can probably redirect its aggressive impulses to the coming real subjugation of earth (no the beta test that Aftran was).

***** Telor has access to more raw computing power than Esplin, but is limited by:

- Inability to perceive reality in real time
- Inability to act in reality except through tiny, imperfect agents
- Diffuse motivation in the form of basically being a giant democracy (where Esplin is a monarchy)

... also don't forget that Alloran was unusually intelligent even for an Andalite, so Telor is smarter but not by, like, orders of magnitude. Call it double or triple the total IQ, with the limitations above, and it's easy to see V3 getting an edge, but also conceivable Telor could turn the tables.

You'll have to look up the structure of DNA, I'm afraid. The nucleotides are what forms the sequence. The 'acid' part is just a description of the macromolecule and plays no importance in the sequence. If it helps, you could read the sentence as 'a long sequence of nucleotides and phosphates' to see the issue with it. I'd suggest dropping the 'acids' or maybe 'a long sequence of genetic material', if you don't want to lock yourself into the idea of all aliens being DNA/RNA compatible.

Do Andalites have tears, or is this an odd human expression that Esplin has picked up? I'm not sure if this is a good metaphor for the idea of disappearing into nothingness, as 1: Yeerks are water-bound and 2: the tears are rejoining the water cycle, and this runs contrary to the idea of nothingness.

The idea with "nucleotides and acids" was to point at both genetic material /and/ proteins (being formed from amino acids). Might've shot myself in the foot with cleverness.

Tears in the rain was just a near-appropriate homage to Bladerunner. For the record, Andalites /do/ produce tears, and also there's meant to be some subtle signaling that Esplin is thinking of Alloran's body as "his" more and more.

Also, a well-designed virus will have the genes for its own coat proteins in its genome. Now, if you want something interesting, you could maybe take this idea and incorporate it into Quat's virus: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4zxe0o/new_virus_breaks_the_rules_of_infection_a_team_at/]]

***** If you were to give a human scientist a bacterial genome or whatever, she would need to insert it into a host cell with its genetic material removed so it could hijack the cellular machinery to start replicating itself.

It's entirely feasible to me that the super-advanced Arn have designed an organism that can't be jump-started just from its own genetic material, and in fact needs a couple of custom-built working ribosomes or whatever before it can start building more of the same and replicating itself normally.

tl;dr: the a.a. sequence could be to assemble the cellular machinery needed to start the DNA sequence actually replicating, instead of chucking into e. coli or whatever.

** Thought-by-thought review:

- As a general thought, it's great this series is back from hiatus, especially now that Glimwarden is entering one. I need my dose of well-written smart characters. :D

- One think I like about this series is the way it handles concepts in epistemology and decision-taking. It's way less in-your-face than HP:MoR, it's integrated in the story in a very show-don't-tell-ish way. It's been said before, one way or another, but it deserves repeating. This chapter in particular does that a lot.

- "Esplin had stayed well clear of /those/ coordinates" This made me chuckle.

- Interesting that Esplin is thinking in both base-7 and base-13. The chapter shows him thinking more and more like an Andalite.

- Speaking of which, I wonder what's going on with him not being able to hear Alloran? My best guess is, Esplin is starting to degrade for spending too much time out of a pool, and is merging with Alloran (well, more than usual) as a result.

- There are a few possibilities Esplin hasn't considered when studying the bridge. One, the bridge could have been created by E/C to bring andalite reinforcements, but shown to Esplin by C/E to thwart that plan. Two, maybe the bridge was shown to Esplin as a way to tamper with his morale or his decision-making, but originally made for different reasons.

- Esplin decides not to send a probe. I'm 95% sure that's a bad idea, possibly with catastrophic consequences. First off, intel is always valuable. In this case, a probe would be able to detect incoming allies who might otherwise show up unannounced and trigger the mines, or incoming enemies, giving Esplin more time to prepare. His reasoning is that a probe would be useless since the bridge was created by gods, but reasoning like that is letting them bully you. Like Skitter said in /Wake/, you don't let your enemy maintain an advantage without making them spend resources for it.

- Wait, bridge? Isn't it more of a tunnel?

- Esplin and the Arn exchanging civilities is kinda cute. With a stolen space satellite dish no less. Even though I don't get 90% of what they're saying.

- Arn territories sound badass. Like a planetful of Minecraft players. The way they live in a tiny ring on a giant crater, between the unbreathable surface and the superhot mantle, is a pretty great re-imagining of their origin story too.

- Holy crap the Arn communicates in C++.

- "When in Rome, one of his human subordinates had quoted to him, do as the Romans do" Huh. Interesting. Was that Telor or Aftran?

- Oh, wait, I get it, it's a /dorica castra/. Well, sort of. The Arn's language isn't nested, it's perfectly linear. So if the Arn ends his, um, word group with a word X, his next 'sentence' starts with the word X. So "[...] the trees protect the air sustains the Arn defend the Visser commands the ships" means "the trees protect the air; the air sustains the Arn; the Arn defend the Visser; the Visser commands the ships". Very clever :)

- What the Arn thinks of Visser's plan: "Oh, so this guy wants to take over the entire universe and remodel it in his image because he has a few objections to the way it works right now. Sounds cool, I guess. Well, it's not actually going to affect my patch of grass, so it doesn't really matter, but it sounds cool."

- "Most of the biomass and the inhabitants had been killed during the cataclysm. Fortunately, the planetary Club for Biology Enthusiasts was having its yearly convention in a super-resistant bunker that day, so they figured something out."

- How did the Arn know to trust the Leeran hypersight? Esplin knows how it works, but the Arn only knew what Esplin told them. On the other hand, they both have nothing to lose and much to win by cooperating, and the ways to annihilate each other if provoked, so they probably didn't worry too much about it.

- I like that Esplin still has a yeerk part that is completely horrified by all the immoral things he keeps doing.

- The "keys to the stars" remark makes me think of Esplin stealing car keys, then showing them to a crowd of cheering Controllers. :p

- The part about how the soldiers hesitate to shoot Visser makes me think of something that often frustrates me in superhero stories: nobody ever takes the initiative of shooting the bad guy. You never see a guard say "fuck it" and shoot the joker while he's safely restrained, and then worry about the consequences. It always bugs me, because at some point, when you realize that your enemy is pushing you and exploiting your unwillingness to retaliate, you should punish them for trying to manipulate you and retaliate anyway. /Twig/ had a nice scene like that a few weeks ago, where Sy tells someone "stop pretending you're about to stab me, it's annoying" and the other immediately stabs him to make a point.

- How exactly do Esplin's sleeper cells work? Are they hiding in broom closets? How do they stay fed, both in food and Kandrona rays? oO

- Shouldn't Telor require to use the Leeran on Esplin to prove his good intentions? It's harder to refuse than going back to the pool since he doesn't risk getting killed (well, less directly), and they do need a proof of his loyalty if they're going to keep following his orders.

- Wait, [[http://www.enjoy-swimming.com/wp-content/uploads/water-noodles.jpg][foam cylinders]]? In a spaceship? In the middle of a pulsating mass of yeerks?

- I really, really want to have a chapter from the perspective of one of the "yeerk-ropes in your ears" Controllers. Seriously.

- Visser One! He said Visser One! Visser One is confirmed as, you know! Someone who exists! Also, as far as we know, there is no Visser Zero. The yeerks still have much to learn.

- The "black-haired woman on a throne of flesh" thing sounds incredibly badass. I look forward to having a protagonist engage with her/it, if ever.

- Hides intel, requires total /and/ unquestioning obedience from his subordinates, isolates them from each other, encourages distrust... The dark side of epistemology is strong with this one.

- Tobias said at one point that he was starting to think like a believer, seeing acts of (a) god in every improbability. Well now Esplin's doing it too!

And now we're back to the crashed spaceship's cliffhanger. I'm impatient to know what happens then :)

Like, sure, perhaps it causes you to question whether your judgment has been compromised/you've been hypnotized, but basically once you're in it it feels unquestionably true, and once you're out of it you can confirm the things you saw inside in objective ways, and that's probably enough for Quat.

Sleeper cells: they were in deep/long-term stasis in tiny nooks in the wall. I had a line about the Visser waking them up with a signal as soon as his ship landed, but it broke the flow no matter where I put it, so I took it out and assumed readers would fill in the cracks with something sane.

** Well, that was a wild ride from start to finish.

Glad the Arn are badasses in this canon. I remember being a frustrated child reading the Hork-Bajir Chronicles, wondering why a species that good at genetic engineering couldn't use it more effectively to fight back.

** Interesting. Very interesting; the description of how a Yeerk pool might try to think around it's limitations and interact with the world in real time, as well as the Visser's thought processes were quite a good read.

It got me thinking though, of how the human race has any kind of chance against the wider universe, when we seem to just be mentally outclassed. The yeerk pools are essentially super intelligence's; Andalite brains are simply stated to be better... it doesn't look good us. We aren't just technologically inferior, but it looks like our computational hardware might be outdated at well.

You could say that out numbers give us an advantage but... when you look at it from a certain angle, Yeerk pools could be considered millions of parts coming together, each bringing its own experiences and memories back, to merge and so cooperate perfectly in their thinking. And the Andalite's communicate through telepathy, which must greatly increase the efficiency with which individuals can work together.

In canon Andalite's are stated as developing technologically at a slow rate. This doesn't quite mesh with the story, where they can think in 7 streams at once, each with different attitudes; a scientist who could do that would be amazing. I believe that someone already posted the idea of groups of Andalite's behaving like a pseudo hive-mind, with background telepathy making it hard for new ideas to take hold in a population. Maybe that would work, as it would mean that even if individual humans are completely outclassed, groups of us work better together. It would give us an edge that, while not making us even close to dominating the galaxy, at least allows to hope that one day we could exist on even footing.

Or something, you know; humans evolved on (from what's been described in the story so far) a pretty unique, diverse planet. There has to be something, other than tasting, that our brains do better than everyone else (not sure if that's a completely rational thought, but it makes sense to me).

Or maybe you could go into the decided lack (baring the cosmic ascended beings) of post-human technology in the setting, given the otherwise highly developed setting. No cyborgs, not internalised brain-computer interfaces, etc... maybe their telepathy means Andalite nervous systems can't handle such enhancements, but our brains can?

Sorry, not trying to tell you how to write the story, because you're doing a truly fantastic, awesome, incredible job so far. I just thought the Earth was looking like it was heading towards being a perpetually Third World Planet populated by relatively dumb naked apes in this fic's universe; a planet that could never Win by its own merits, not in a thousand years, not ever. And that would be a sad ending to Ratfic indeed.

Bear in mind we've only really seen /isolated/ Andalites in this story. Andalites with at most one other voice in their head.

Seven thought-streams won't do you much good if each stream is browsing a separate metaphorical Reddit thread, or chatting with a different relative on the phone.

** Little late to this thread, just wanted to say that this is my favourite chapter so far. Most of my reasons have been expressed by others in this thread already, so I'll just add that the flow of the chapter (Ellimist/Crayak revelation, Arn dialogue, Telor confrontation, victory) is extremely satisfying.

How long did it take you to plan the chapter? It's well-crafted in every respect.

** Just caught up with the story recently, and I wanted to say I've really been enjoying it. The characters in particular are just so well-done; they have very distinctive perspectives that come across really well in their chapters. Reading something ambitious, for me, is kind of like watching someone gently juggle puppies; you just know there's a screwup coming in a second, and it won't be the end of the world but it's gonna be painful. You haven't dropped one yet, and I'm excited to see what new miniature mutts you've got up your sleeve.

I really like how Esplin is basically a ratfic protagonist cobbling together all sorts of OP tech for crazy plans, culminating in an ultimate plot to kill Death itself.

** Finally found an opportunity to catch up!

This was good, but slightly confusing.

I thought the "true Vanarx" was entropy/Murphy's law? Leerans can mind-meld two people together now? Alloran is /gone/ and Esplin isn't bothered?! Maybe it's been too long since I read the Visser's last chapter.

I also spent a part of the chapter assuming the 13 representatives were a rationalized Council of 13, but that's on me for forgetting Yeerks just really like the number 13. It ended up throwing me off for that whole section, as they're supposed to be meeting as equals rather than the Visser being called before his boss. I may have to re-read that bit.

But enough about me - so much coolness, with the Arn and the Implications and the Plots, oh my. Great re-interpretation of the Quantum Virus.

If I had a criticism, it would be that the Vissir felt a little too /rationalist/ (as opposed to rational.) He's very quick to start thinking in terms of being simulated in Newcomb-esque fashion (to the point where it looks like he outsmarted himself?), he resolves to defeat Death and treats that like a big deal even though death is almost unknown among his species, he's frustrated at others' stupidity despite knowing he was biologically engineered to be more intelligent and Yeerks explicitly having a sliding scale of intellect - although the avatar he meets doesn't /seem/ very superintelligent. It felt a lot like a conscious attempt to emulate Professor Quirrell.

Definitely gave the feeling the human author was bleeding through a bit, especially during the first section.

But those Arn ... mm. A wonderful re-interpretation of the original. It's a shame we definitely won't get an Arn interlude, because I get the feeling you've worked out a lot of what goes on behind those eyes ... is the fact that they need context for everything connected to their inability to value things outside their homeworld?

*** To allay at least one small part of your confusion---

You know how you might be (let's say) all about gender inequality, and yet nevertheless spend an entire Tuesday afternoon fuming because somebody said or did something reprehensible w/r/t sexual politics? Or even more "trivially," because somebody cut you off in traffic?

The true Vanarx is Moloch. Entropy and Murphy, just as you said---everything from multipolar traps and tragedies-of-the-commons down to the waste of useable energy. That's what V3 is focused on "killing."

He got a little bit pissed in this chapter about being jerked around by gods who---in his view---aren't DOING anything with the power that he's desperately trying to get, himself. That included some anger at death and waste generally, but it doesn't change his larger focus. He wants things to make sense and be ordered---in MTG terms, he's a blue-black villain who will be a blue-white villain once all of creation /is/ him (and therefore self-centeredness /is/ caring about the community).

I guess maybe the writing was a little clumsy, if it felt to you like a turn. He'll be visibly centered on Vanarx/Moloch in the future, and maybe I'll want to tweak this to make the distinction clear. But the thoughts about death were a catalyst, and the broader transformation was more about the line between him and Alloran blurring than it was about him changing the target.

Esplin /was/ bothered by Alloran's silence/absence, but he was somewhat distracted by evidence that the whole star system was being manipulated by beings with far greater reach than any level of technology he'd seen previously.

Death of an entire pool might be rare, but even the individual Yeerks are sapient, and just last chapter we had Alloran's musing on Yeerk attitudes to the Vanarx:

#+begin_quote
  I did not understand their horror, at first---the hushed tones, the nervous glances, the trembling digits. There are other causes of death, after all, and for all that the Vanarx is inexorable---to a Yeerk---it is also rare. In two long revolutions on the homeworld, I saw only four, and only one at close range.

  [...]

  But the Vanarx does not harm the host. Once it has consumed the Yeerk, it withdraws, allowing the poor Gedd to continue its usual aimless stumbling, until sooner or later it stops for a drink---

  ---at which point the Yeerks retake it, and the memory of death is reclaimed.

  /Every/ death.

  Every desperate chase.

  Every horrifying capture.

  The last shreds of hope, vanishing as the purple closes in.

  It is a nightmare that every Yeerk has lived over and over, a wound that every pool has felt untold times. Whether they carry the actual memories or not, every individual shard takes with it the/dread/, the hopeless helplessness of an endless string of gruesome defeats.

  It's no wonder that even Esplin was afraid.
