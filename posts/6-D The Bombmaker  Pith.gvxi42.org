** I've been loving this serial! Very well written, and the “magic” system is super interesting. Definitely worth a binge if you haven't checked it out yet

** Nice to see a new Ana chapter. I like how she and "Wes" have constantly shifting opinions of each other as they come to understand one another.

I suspect Ana will need to forcefully obtain a new body from one of her enemies shortly. She won't want to, and would hate herself for it, but her options are running out.

I've been thinking about this too, if she's willing to use lethal force against people (which she has) then I don't see why she wouldn't do the forced transference thing on someone.

**** I think it is because if you have time to lock them down in a safe location and do forced transference you don't need to kill them by her moral code even if that's a bit inconsistent

  I'd overheard him talking to the Rose Titan on the fishing boat. He'd said that he hated himself, that he didn't need to learn humility.

  But he hadn't apologized either. I'd seen that mindset before in my co-workers and the middle managers at Clementine's estate.

  The truth was, you could hate yourself and be a self-centered prick at the same time. The two often went hand in hand.

Best line.

  I looked at the bald man. “You know Wes was joking back there, right?” I whispered. “When he said we were incom -- “

I'm torn on these bits.

On the one hand, I'm happy the author is reacting to comments and making small adjustments like that.

On the other hand, we're a small audience so far, and I don't want to influence the writing too much. A lot of people are mad about Ward changing course during several arcs because of fan reactions.

I'm not too worried, though. These bits have sounded mostly organic so far.

** Great chapter.

One thing I found particularly interesting was this line:

"I didn't hide my Pith from Clementine.  That was impossible, right now."

I'm assuming the part about Ana hiding her own pith being impossible at that moment was because Clementine was already projecting into it, but I think the implications of hiding her own pith have a lot of interesting implications. One being that her visual illusions won't be super easy to see through by any competent projector, but more importantly, she might become immune to any vocation that requires the user to project into her pith.

Another interesting bit was this:

"Clods of dirt flew above my head and exploded into soil, showering down over me.  /Fuck./  I could mask the position of my Pith, but if that dirt hit me, she'd feel my outline.  She'd know my exact location."

I had actually considered this a while back as a sort of default sixth sense that might arise from most elemental magic systems. It seems to me, that depending on how small of an object a projector can control, they might, for example, project into water vapor in the air to sense any and all objects displacing it. I'd be curious to see if Ana could create illusions against this too since she can already affect someone else's pith sense.
