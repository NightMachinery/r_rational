** Last time, Sander's trip into the sky revealed a few hundred people making their way in from the town of Gossom.

This chapter brought to you late by [[http://i.imgur.com/nxcYIbi.png][Shaun, the Schedule Slip Snail.]] I blame not having power for five days.

*** No power for 5 days, I've done that in a Florida hurricane but wow what happened?

I didn't read a chapter until 2 days ago because I'm a procrastinator but I got to read 10 in a row so that was very nice and I'm definitely hooked. It has a real "Attack on Titan" feel for humanity, basically trapped behind walls (of light).

*** I just read 10 chapters in the last three days. Great story so far. The whole time Sander is teleportation I keep hearing "Now your thinking with portals".

What has the schedule normally been for updates?

**** The schedule is normally three Fridays in a row, then a break, but I skipped last Friday due to writing difficulties. Chapter 11 should be up tomorrow and my plan is that there won't be another break until Chapter 15 to make up for lost time. Glad you enjoyed it!

** I predict that the man in the red armor is not a spirit.

If that's the case, then why is his voice described as sounding "off in a subtly unpleasant way?"

Does he have a verbal tick? Is he some kind of darkling-human hybrid? Does he have a Russian accent?

All of these guesses are technically possible, and I look forward to finding out more in future chapters.

** Damn you Shaun! You always ruin everything! That's why no one likes you!

- I feel sorry for William. He is kind of an entitled asshole, but wow, Melanie is cruel to him.

- Is it me or did Philip try to shake Sander off by dropping him into Melanie's lap? I can sort of see them keep doing that to each other in the long term, actually.

- It wasn't really flying, it was just falling with... it was just falling.

- Sander realized that almost getting transformed into horribly crushed body parts of Sander right after leaving the hospital may not impress Melanie! Keep it up, and maybe you'll internalize "Almost dying is very bad and I should avoid it" at some point!

- "I was young and naive". Yeah, I know this feeling. I also know the feeling of looking back to my past self who said "I was young and naive, but now I'm wise and sensible", which was incredibly naive of him. So now to be safe I try to feel naive all the time. Sander might want to do that too.

- It dawns on me that we still don't know what Sander thinks about Melanie. He didn't think about her in any of his viewpoint chapters. I'd be really interested in getting his opinion on her, actually. The others have described him as oblivious to her disposition, but that might not be true given his "notice things, but don't pay attention to them" tendencies so far.

- "So once you were in the air, you teleported straight down?" "Wel, um, yes! That is a very smart non-dangerous thing and it, um, it is exactly what I did."

- Did Philip forget to tell the council about the destruction of Langust, and the coming refugees? What the hell, Philip?

- It seems that Philip is trying to blame Gossom for some of the refugees' condition. Not sure what's his game here.

What? How was she cruel to him? He wasn't just "entitled," he literally walked into her place of work and said she would make a fool of herself.

All she did was use his own words to question the consistency of his beliefs or motives. She was far more civil than she could have been in response.

It's bizarre to have that characterized as "cruel." What would you have done in her place?

*** My guess is Philip didn't reveal information about Langust because he wanted to keep his radio communications secret? (otherwise for example his father the mayor might force Philip to let him listen in future?)

*** Re: flying, didnt sander Re'port in air with added upwards momentum? Thats very much different from falling.

Re: Melanie, dont think too cruel from her. It seems to mirror very well the stories I hear from women about unwanted suitors, and what measures must be taken to indeed get rid of them. Props to Alexander for including it,even!

*** Well, realistically, it could happen. For instance, Gavin Masters could, after a long decade of life-changing adventures, learning Important Life Lessons, making True Friends, decide to come back to his daughter and apologize for leaving her (then leave again, because Light's Hollow sucks and everybody there is a jerk anyway). Or he could have died three years ago in a traveling lantern failure.
