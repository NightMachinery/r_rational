** I have a question about this situation. Subtracting Temari and Kankuro out of the equation for this.

How exactly could the Konoha 11 get in trouble for meeting up like this in a legal sense? What constitutes this as a "council" when they could just as easily say they're training together? The fact that it's secret wouldn't really change anything, It's not like you're forced to announce every time you meet up with friends and train with another Konoha shinobi. I don't see what could legally happen to everyone if Temari and Kankuro "exposed" this meeting had they been turned away. I feel like a may have missed something here so I'd appreciate the clarification.

On a different note, seriously keep up the good work. You're putting these chapters out pretty damn fast.

Edit: I was gonna leave this review on the chapter but I think it'll be easier for discussion if I posted it here

I absolutely love the short exchange between Temari and Naruto at the end of the chapter. Of course you gotta torture us with the cliffhanger lol. Can't wait for the next chapter, I'm pondering what she means by "nothing much". I think she's come to the conclusion that Naruto is just a relatively normal person despite his abilities and what he did to Gaara.

Notice how Tenten is acting around Kankuro right now, people tend to have a heavily altered perception of someone when extreme emotions and/or trauma are at play. Since Naruto is the guy who killed her little brother, she's gonna have a certain perception of him based off that before ever truly interacting with him. Once you start mingling with people on a different "side" than you, you start to realize you're not all that much different. Naruto is just a normal person pretty much and she's seeing that.

Now I may be completely off the mark but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it.

*** On the subject of why they don't want the council to know it's basically just what Sasuke said last chapter. The konoha council doesn't want anyone getting power too fast, before they've proven their loyalty, before they've proven they aren't another Itachi. This goes double with a large group gaining a lot of power. What the council would be concerned about is a group other than themselves having significant military might, for fear of revolt. A very reasonable fear given what we know of Narutos motives. You also talk about what legal charges the council could bring against the Konoha 12. You must bear in mind that Konoha is not a democracy nor even a constitutional monarchy, its a military oligarchy. The only reason laws exist is to govern those without a clan, when the clans interests are at stake the council can take unilateral action.

**** I see, so the number of people here is basically the big concern. Had Naruto just simply shared his findings about chakra with either Sasuke or Sakura since they were all on the same team it wouldn't get any attention, where as amassing a big group like this with the intention of gaining power of any kind is a threat to what the council established. And so you're saying even if there aren't any actual laws against grouping together and training/sharing knowledge, the council wouldn't need there to be to still strike out against them sorta how the Uchiha clan were taken out behind the scenes.

***** Yeah, it's important to bear in mind that Konoha isn't a modern nation-state. It's a feudal military dictatorship, kept in check by local nobility. This study-session annoys every power group within the system, as no clan wants its techniques given away to their rivals.

To a large extent, the law here is whatever the people in charge say it is, provided they can at least come up with a fig leaf of a justification. Purposely scaring them or annoying them is dangerous. Worthwhile, for this group of students, but still dangerous.

*** You have to remember that forbidden techniques are a thing. In NTBS it's not so much that you can't learn certain techniques because they are dangerous to the user (That never made much sense to me: If you're using child soldiers you might as well go all the way), but rather that Konoha is worried that those techniques will fall into enemy hands. Imagine how much the Sand could learn if they found an opportunity to read Naruto's mind, for example. Naruto might get away with learning secret techniques because of his family connections, but sharing secret intel with the Kazekage's children or even with Leaf gennin is a huge no-no.

The other part is that just like Kaukamieli said, there is as much rivalry between clans as there is between Villages. Sure, Konoha is united in theory, but they still spend 99% of their time interacting with other Leaf shinobi, and the thing about ninjas is that nobody actually trusts each other. If Neji were to reveal the Byakugan's secrets to Sasuke for example, well, Hiashi would not be pleased. And of course, the first priority of anyone in power is to hold on to it, and no ruler or council would ever be happy about nobles sharing power and meeting in secret behind their back.

**** Even if Konoha uses child soldiers, it at least tries to be a bit better about stuff like that, so I'd buy the danger explanation.

It's not like there aren't loads of useful techniques to teach, so there might not be many reasons to teach just those dangerous ones.

*** I've done my best to write it that way, and my beta reader wrote all of his feedback for me without ever having read or watched a single episode of Naruto, so it should be possible. If you do read it, please let me know how well you can understand what's going on, because that would be really valuable feedback for me actually.

**** I only know naruto through rational fanfic (and vague cultural osmosis I guess) and I can read this just fine, if that helps. Although I did have to reread from the start when you picked it back up just to reseparate it from LutD and such.

** I've been rushing through all the chapters in a couple of days now and I love the story. Also reading them so quickly there is really visible improvement in your writing, so kudos to that.

​

What I might have missed somehow is, how exactly Naruto was able to summon Gaara / one-tail in a previous chapter. Wasn't the rule that you have to be stronger than the target, i.e. expand more chakra than the target? It was hinted by other characters later, that it only worked once Gaara let one-tail take over, but I don't see how that would make it easier, and how Naruto would know to wait for that moment.

*** Thanks! I thought I was improving, but it's nice to have it confirmed :)

The explanation for that lies in the mechanics of summoning and that of chakra itself: It was hinted at in the chapter where Naruto learns the summoning technique, as I explain here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a041x6/rtff_naruto_the_need_to_become_stronger_chapter/eafhg1o]]

But there is also a second reminder given in this chapter, if you read between the lines:

#+begin_quote
  “Don't tell anyone,” he said hurriedly. “Nobody is supposed to know I have this.” He unfurled the parchment which he had wrapped around the handle of the knife. “This is a summoning scroll, the kind we were given in the Forest of Death. The basic idea is that you fill the knife with chakra, clone it, and then when the cloned knife hits your target the resulting burst of chakra activates the scroll and summons you to its location.” He showed the scroll to Shino. “The thing is, I tested it and the natural resistance that makes it so difficult to seal chakra also makes it much harder to summon it, at least when it comes to people rather than spirit animals since those kinda have to be able to absorb natural chakra just to stay alive. So if you're able to shunt all your chakra elsewhere, even temporarily, it suddenly becomes possible to teleport yourself without it costing everything you have.”
#+end_quote

Basically, so-called spirit animals can only exist despite their massive size because they absorb natural chakra from their surroundings: That's why you only have giant chakra animals in high-chakra density areas like the forest of death, and why summoned animals have to go back to where they came from after a while. Because spirit animals constantly absorb chakra from their surroundings, they don't have the resistance to foreign chakra that humans do - they would die if they did! That's why they are vulnerable to genjutsu and summoning techniques, and that's why Gaara lost his ability to resist Naruto's summoning the moment he let Shukaku take over.
