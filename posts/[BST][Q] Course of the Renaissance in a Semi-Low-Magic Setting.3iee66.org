I am currently running a tabletop game for a few different sets of friends using the same overall setting, but with tweaks for each group to better suit their entertainment. With some of them, it is possible that the game will continue for a long enough time that players will switch to play their characters' children/apprentices/whatever.

The issue at hand, however, is that the overall setting is that of the beginning of the renaissance in a world with semi-low-magic. I have my own ideas about what might be brought about, but I don't want to poison the well too thoroughly here so I'll simply give as much likely-relevant information about the setting as I can.

Finally, I will note that some things have been adapted from the original setting as given in the book, largely because I've tried to fill in the gaps or make sense where things were contradictory or appeared to be some way without any real reasoning.

*The World*

The world is similar to ours in terms of the continents, but for the fact that each continent is largely disconnected from the others. You still have Europe, where the game typically takes place, but there is no land connection to Africa or Asia. It is certainly /known/ that those places exist, and they have their own kingdoms, languages and cultures. Trade with them is incredibly lucrative, but the sea voyage is a little difficult due to distance.

*Europe*

...or "Calabria", as it's actually known in-setting. The continent has settled into a few major power blocks, held together under somewhat shaky alliance/vassalage systems.

Rather recently (last 100 years), the Triskellian Empire managed to get around 3/4 of the continent under thumb, but failed to truely centralize its power. As a result, that land is divided largely between the kingdoms of Avoirdupois to the East, Doloreaux to the North, and Bisclavret to the West. In the center, is the Rome/Venice-esque city of Triskellian, which has lately lost all real authority over the three kingdoms that once pledged service to it.

The Emperor is dead, and the guilds and nobility have very carefully kept the throne empty so that they may fill the power vacuum themselves. They are aided by the suspicion that the Queen (before her self-imposed exile) arranged for his murder, as well as that of his heirs (birthed by the previous and late Queen), so that her son would be that much closer to the throne.

The three kingdoms of Bisclavret, Doloreaux, and Avoirdupois would each benefit greatly should they take the city of Triskellian for their own, yet none can manage it as the other two would doubtlessly march quickly to the city's defense.

Beyond that, there are the less advanced nations of Phelan, Keylljeyder, and Chevernaise, and the civil-war-torn isle of Auvrich.

One last note is that both indentured servitude and slavery do exist in Calabria. These largely come about as a result of complete failure to pay debts, or as spoils of war. The practice is outlawed (beyond special allowances) within the city of Triskellian, and looked down upon in Avoirdupois and Doloreaux.

*Technology*

The source book is irritatingly sparse in regards to what technologies are known, but I believe certain conclusions can be drawn by the sorts of goods that are available:

- Crossbows

  - Lever Crossbow
  - Winch Crossbow
  - Arbalest
  - Composite Bow

- Guns

  - Fusil
  - Musket
  - Pistol

- Metals

  - Steel
  - Silver
  - Ambrascura - "There is a species of eel in Epinian Bay that ingests dirt and small rocks, then vomits them back up covered in a hard, gray substance, in irregular shapes. It can be riveted into armor."
  - Alumen - "A metal even rarer than gold that some claim to be mined from the moon, but is found primarily in eastern Calabria."
  - Eryth - "The Jakobas made their fortune importing erythrosinum: a mineral whose method of discovery is unknown, but it can be combined with steel."

*Magic*

Magic can be organized into a few overall categories: Elemental, Cognesante, Thaumaturgy, White, and Black.

As a general rule, anyone can learn to use any magic so long as they have a teacher or the written materials and drive to self-teach. Most people /don't/, simply because it takes a great deal of effort for what is either accomplish-able by normal means (novice elemental, cognesante, and thaumaturgy), heavily controlled and regulated by the state (advanced elemental cognesante, and thaumaturgy), controlled directly by the orthodox S'Allumer church and tied to strength of faith (white), or BANNED BANNED KILL IT WITH FIRE BEFORE IT CAN CAST ANYTHING everywhere (black.)

(A side note, to give an idea of how dangerous black magic is: It's necromancy with some von neuman flavoring. Nations will literally /stop a war/ to handle a black magic practitioner if one is found. The last two major historic eras are defined by the last two times a necromancer managed to rise to considerable power, and written records are severely lacking from before that point. This is not helped by the fact that one of the side-effects of exposure to black magic is the development of malign personality disorders.)

While theoretically anyone can learn any magic, certain people do have natural inclinations towards one type or another, and advancing to the higher levels of magic becomes increasingly dependent upon natural ability (completely aside from state/religious regulations.)

One interesting facet is the existence of elementals; personifications of the four elements (fire, wind, earth, water) which can be bound by an elemental mage strong enough in their craft. An elemental can be put to a task (so long as it's relatively simple), but a mage must be careful not to leave them unattended for too long otherwise elemental tend to become unbound or overzealous in carrying out orders.

*In Summary*

I'm sure there's plenty of information lacking, but I'm happy to answer any questions with the source material (and my own headcanon where the source is insufficient.) In any case, I'm quite eager to see what [[/r/rational]] makes of this setting in terms of technological advancement in the next 50-100 years!

If I've made any sort of mistake, mislabeling, or whatever, just let me know and I'll do my best to make amends.


** You talked about the end technologies, but I'm more interested in the social and scientific technologies. Advancement isn't going to come through magic alone, especially if magic has been around for centuries. It's going to come through new ways of thinking.

So, do they have the scientific method? What mathematics do they have? What institutions exist to promote learning and exploration of new ideas? Are there printing presses yet, or something that approximates them? Newspapers?

It is entirely possible that there are only minor technological advancements in the next hundred years; a slightly better way of plowing fields, a more efficient way to bind elemental spirits, a new type of forge that allows for more production of iron, etc. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_technology][Check out the Wikipedia page on Renaissance technology]] and note how little actual progress is made over roughly two hundred years. (The Renaissance as I understand it was mostly about culture rather than actual science.)

** I would like more information about your magic. It looks powerful enough that, IMO, it would be widespread. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding something, so to clarify:

1) Do your magic require long chants/rituals? Or is it limited by any sort of Vancian system or slowly replenishing mana?

2) Is your magic efficient in combat? Can Wind mage kill someone by manipulating air inside his lungs? Can fire mage roast person (or at least part of his brain) in several seconds? Do they require relatively slow-moving projectiles? Can they block gunfire with windshields? What about charging soldiers?

Depending on those answers, mages can be far more efficient combat units compared to knights. If so, all medieval leadership would practice combat magic instead of jousting, and guns may be much less effective in reducing their power.

3) Is there any magic (maybe Thaumaturgy) which allows to significantly increase crop production? If it is, it will be used on any farm, and becoming good "farm mage" would be great career choice.

4) Can magic efficiently heal and/or increase lifespan? If it can, magic healers would be widespread among high class (and may be extremely widespread, depending on learning effort required). Renaissance may see mages moving from castles and mansions to public hospitals.

5) Can magic efficiently gather/analyze information (prophets, clarvoiants and such)? Won't be widespread besides royal advisors (and maybe military), but during Renaissance information magic may start to find it's use in police forces.

** Important changes tend to affect a lot of people. The easiest way to make that happen is directly.

Can a journeyman magician create an automated manufactory without much difficulty, for instance? Then even if they only account for one person in ten thousand, you'll end up with wealthy producers switching to automated manufacturing and cheap goods all around. This requires a monied class with an interest in increasing their wealth and no more important uses for their money or their mages. If the start of manufacturing rests on automation, you won't see [[http://pdfernhout.net/beyond-a-jobless-recovery-knol.html][job loss]] as a result, but you're reasonably likely to see the same end.

Do mages have health-related spells? Especially if they're available to clerics who deal with the common people on a regular basis, we'll see public hospitals, increased life expectancies, less disease.

How much time does it take to do things magically versus normally? If a half decent magician can produce, say, barrels at a hundred times the rate of a master cooper, then there's an incentive to produce items with magic, even if the magician costs much more than the cooper.

In short, what good are mages? What ways of applying them seem obvious now but might not have previously?
