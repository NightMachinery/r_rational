Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I don't regularly follow this thread, so it may have been discussed before, but what do you guys have to say about memory improvement books? Moonwalking With Einstein is arriving in the mail tomorrow, and I read Unlimited Memory on Saturday, but haven't put in the time to practice it yet. Is this a legitimate field of study that can improve memory to the degree promised, is it pseudoscience, or somewhere in between? If it's anywhere close to the former, it seems like the kind of thing that should be shared with everyone, and would be an extremely easy way to sell people on improving your thinking, given the tangible benefits. I don't have a child, nor am I anywhere near ready to in any sense of the word, but how to efficiently memorize things would be one of the first things I would teach my potential child because it makes every other area of study easier, and I would similarly push for it to be taught in elementary school.

*** I haven't gone into the really fancy stuff, like memory walks and similar, but I've found spaced repetition systems to be very effective (specifically [[https://apps.ankiweb.net][Anki]]).

Once you finish the books and put some time into the practice, do you think you could report back? I've been thinking of getting MWE, but haven't been sure about it.

Bill Gates recommended MWE, which is the reason I bought it, so I'm inclined to think that there's something to it. It's only $11, so the risk reward makes it a decent bet given that recommendation.

  ... but what do you guys have to say about memory improvement books?
#+end_quote

The best one is /Your Memory: How it Works and How to Improve it/ by Higbee. [[https://imgur.com/a/n8KPo][Here's the table of contents]]. Higbee was a psychologist and wrote it specifically to bridge the gap between the memory books that were strictly theoretical with no practical applications, and the memory books that were mostly practical with little scientific backing. He used it as a textbook in his classes.

As you can see from the TOC, it's pretty comprehensive.

#+begin_quote
  Is this a legitimate field of study that can improve memory to the degree promised, is it pseudoscience, or somewhere in between?
#+end_quote

It's legit.

In 2006 the Norwegian Memory Champion taught three random people to remember 1005 decimals of pi in 10 hours. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQfrN-ZIeMo][Video here]]. (Sorry it's Norwegian only, and the auto-translate is hilariously bad.)

Results: the man remembered only 120 decimals, but both women remembered all 1005 decimals, resulting in a new (at the time) women's world record (at least according to the video, although [[http://www.pi-world-ranking-list.com/index.php?page=lists&category=pi][this website]] only lists it as a Norwegian record).

The caveats here are that these people had expert guidance, and the task was well defined: remembering digits in a specific order.

But the encouraging bit is that these people had no previous experience at all.

As far as I can tell from the video they used the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system][Major System]] to translate numbers into letters, and then assemble the letters into words (the names of objects), and then they place these objects along a journey. ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]].)

To retrieve the digits, you then simply mentally walk along the route, retrieve the object stored at each location, and then translate the letters of the word of the object back into numbers according to the rules of the Major System.

If you're not interested in remembering digits of pi (and honestly: who is? lol), then you simply translate whatever text you want to remember into an object and then use the journey method directly.

The Greeks and Romans used this to remember their speeches.

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  ... how to efficiently memorize things would be one of the first things I would teach my potential child because it makes every other area of study easier, and I would similarly push for it to be taught in elementary school.
#+end_quote

Double yes.

Higbee notes that the different techniques can be used successfully with children and the intellectually disabled, and quotes examples to this effect.

--------------

One pedantic note:

When we talk about /remembering/, what we're really interested in is /recalling/ information.

That is to say: when I'm in /this/ situation, talking about /this/ subject, I want /this thought/ to automatically arise in my consciousness.

An excellent way of ensuring this is to create [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] flashcards.

Whenever you read a fact that's worth remembering, you rephrase it as a question-and-answer pair, or a fill-in-the-blank card.

E.g.:

- Q: What's the volume of a tea-spoon?
- A: 5 mL

Or:

- Q: What three factors increase the memorability of a mental image?
- A: Vividness, interactiveness, and bizarreness.

Then you simply practise answering these cards, with increasing intervals between repetitions. (Anki elegantly combines active recall, the spacing effect, and interleaving in one wholesome package.)

**** Thank you for the comment. I will likely end up reading your book recommendation, although maybe not soon.

The author of Unlimited Memory claimed he memorized 10,000 digits of pi, and beat the previous world record for recall using the number to word method. His book covers that, along with the loci method and a few other techniques. One system was to create a list of words that rhyme with numbers (one-bun, two-shoe, etc.) and associate whatever you are trying to remember with the number word. Better for things you don't need sequential access to, but potentially very useful.

I don't intend to memorize digits of pi, since I've already done so for the first ten digits and that's probably more than I will ever have the need to recall offhand. Maybe I'll do so for the speed of light, e, or other important constants like that.

I've downloaded Anki, because it seems like everyone and their mother is recommending it in this thread. Thanks for the recommendation.

*** I imagine that it would depend largely on how you think.

It's kind of like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map][mind maps]], I'd imagine. I never saw the /point/ of mind maps; they didn't help me in the least. I tried using them only when some of my schoolteachers told us to, but it gave me no improvement over written notes. It was only years later that I came to the realisation that /some people actually DO think like that/. And for those people, mind maps really /will/ work, because what is in the paper is a better reflection of what is in the head.

I suspect that memory improvement tricks are probably similar. They'll work for some people - and the people for whom they work will write books describing how they work and/or recommend the books that worked for them. And, from the accounts that I've heard, these tricks will work /really well/ when they do work.

But they might not work as well for everyone.

Having said that, give it a try! If it works for you, the benefits can be immense - if it doesn't, you're out a small financial commitment.

** I have a topic that I've been thinking about for a while, but I haven't really figured out how to put in the words. I know this sub has some pretty anti-death sentiments, as shown by the popularity of CGP Grey's [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9][video on the topic]]. The video does a great job of breaking down why anybody would have pro-death sentiments, and how they can be dangerous:

- Humans have never known a reality in which we don't die, so we don't have any frame of reference for a world without death.
- With our current technology, it's impossible to prevent death, so people choose to romanticise it as a coping mechanism.
- Humans feel an innate sense of “wrongness” at the concept of immortality, and popular media often portrays it as a curse rather than a blessing.

That's all well and good, but I've noticed an inconsistency with how this sub (and the rationalist community as a whole) reacts to a similar topic. Namely, it seems like people have an extremely adverse reaction to the concept of [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading][wireheading]]. To me, it seems like a lot of the same criticisms of being pro-death apply to being anti-wireheading:

- Humans have always naturally found means of happiness, so we don't have any frame of reference for a gratifying life by chemical means.
- We don't have the technology to consistently make people happy, and the drugs we /do/ currently have often have extreme side effects, so we romanticise "pure" means of achieving happiness.
- Humans associate wireheading with modern forms of hedonism (drug abuse, escapism, social isolation) without considering it in the context of the future.

To be clear, I also feel an innate aversion to wireheading, but I'm wondering if it might not be rational to discard it just because it doesn't perfectly fit my conception of “ideal happiness”. Could it be that the best possible future is one where we're all hooked up to dopamine drips? It's not a pleasant thought, but it might be a necessary one.

Thoughts?

*** It depends on what one means by wireheading. If you're talking about reducing the entirety of human experience to an unchanging and constant sensation of joy, like a video game which has been reduced to one screen that blares out "A WINNER IS YOU!" for all eternity, then the chief emotions that are conjured up in me are disgust and bewilderment that anyone would find this attractive. At that point, why not just commit suicide?

On the other hand, some people talk about [[https://www.wireheading.com][eliminating pain and establishing gradients of bliss]], and I find this to be a far less objectionable argument. Certainly, there is a part of me that dislikes the idea of engineering pain away, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a broken part of me that could only develop in a broken world, and that it'll be abandoned by future generations (or to put it another way, I can reason out how a future with any kind of pain would be inferior but I don't feel that wrongness on a visceral level, the way that I feel the wrongness of e.g. abusing animals).

*** I certainly don't have an aversion to carefully, properly done improvement of my happiness. I'm actually on anti-depressants right now, which are essentially a primitive form of that. The key is that I want to be modified to find pleasure in doing things that I want to do - eg eating salad tasting great, etc. Not have my mind put into a coma of continuous pleasure where I never make any choice again - ie be turned into hedonium.

*** Wireheading's already a thing; you can just drug yourself up to eleven and live the entirety of your remaining lifespan full of hedons.

That we don't already do it suggests that pleasure is not the same as utility. Your value intuition likely pushes you away from maximising happiness, instead looking for more other things like meaning, satisfaction, etc. Which is also why they're higher-status.

Most people's intuition also pushes them away from dying, so in that there's a difference.

**** Value intuition, taken over an entire society, is an evolved bias to human perception; that is to say, value intuition is going to (on average) put the most value on behaviours likely to lead to having grandchildren. It values living, so that you can be around to support children and possibly long enough to support grandchildren; it pushes you away from mere permanent hedonistic pleasure and towards stability of food and shelter, so that your children and grandchildren are more likely to survive; and so on.

Value intuition is an important part of the human psyche. But is it really a good idea to base your morality on what is most likely to see your genes successfully propagated into the future?

Concretely this means that the values we have are obviously not random, they were selected via their fitness. They are not exactly equal to evolutionary fitness (i.e. gene propagation success). So you shouldn't base morality on evolutionary fitness; instead you should base it on fulfilling human values.

In any case no matter how your values came to be, you should base your morality on what the values actually are. I expect in small-scale situations your intuition will have better insight into your values than purely logical reasoning. (Modulo depressive moods etc where your intuition might say that you won't enjoy anything ever, and logical reasoning can help break out from that)

****** I don't think we're actually disagreeing here. I think I'm just communicating poorly.

- The value intuition of an individual is a very variable thing, yes. I'm not talking about the value intuition of an individual; I'm talking about the average long-term value intuition over a large population (this already covers for depressive moods etc.)

- Yes, humans have adaptations that we execute. But living longer is more likely to result in the presence of more children and hence more grandchildren - this is true now and was true all throughout human history. Adaptations that improved the desire to /live longer/ and /find a secure source of food/ are adaptations that would have helped your genes survive throughout the entirety of human history.

- Value intuitions are not, in and of themselves, values. It's not hard to find a situation where average-over-a-large-population value intuitions are in direct opposition to one's actual values. And whether you should base your morality on your values or derive your values from your morality is another completely different debate. But I think that we can agree that you shouldn't be basing your morality on how many grandchildren it gives you.

I think that the traditional description of utilitarianism is wrong, and definitely incomplete. "Maximizing happiness" would definitely lead to wireheading, because wireheading is just shortcutting all the work for making suffering people happy. A better description would be "maximize the values that make us happy", which is still incomplete, but i believe to be more accurate. Would I want to live in a society that has abandoned all art, beauty, science, knowledge, critical thinking, love, and everything worthwhile about humanity, so long as all the people can put on a helmet or flip a switch and experience complete bliss? That sounds like one of the more horrifying dystopias to me. Happiness is an evolutionary way of making organisms do things that they like by giving them an immediate, tangible reward for the completion of some abstract goal. I want the things that currently make me happy to be maximized, not the happiness itself unless it comes about through the former method.

I don't have any innate problem with people occasionally using drugs or anything else to experience those wirehead like feelings, so long as they keep it occasional rather than consuming their existence.
