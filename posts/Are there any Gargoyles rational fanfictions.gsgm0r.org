What the title says. I've been re-watching Gargoyles on Disney+ and not only it seems a very fascinating universe to explore - but David Xanatos is such a perfect prototype to make into a fascinating, multifaceted rational villain it would seem weird to me if no one has tried yet. Is there anything out there that you'd recommend?


** Xanatos is a really hard villain to write to be much more rational than he already is.

For one thing, he's already succeeded at most of his life goals. He's insanely wealthy, has married a beautiful, intelligent woman, and gained power through his membership in the Illuminati. When he plans his schemes, he makes sure that nearly all outcomes gain him something.

He's ever really basically been shown to have three goals: to protect and expand his wealth, family, and influence; to gain immortality; and to overcome interesting challenges. The first two are pretty much rational goals by definition, and the last... well, to paraphrase Professor Quirrell, "What's the point of being an Evil Overlord if you always have to follow /all/ the rules?" What's the point of having all the money and power, if you're constantly bored?

I can only count /three times/ that Xanatos lands in any real trouble: when he recruits the Gargoyles to steal Cyberbiotics technology (gets arrested), when he creates Thailog (gets betrayed and nearly killed), and when Oberon comes for Titania's grandson (is attacked by a being of godlike power).

The first instance is a genuine failure, but it only results in him getting imprisoned for a few months; the worst he complains about to Owen is the food. And, for the most part, it was the result of something he had good reason to believe wouldn't happen, and was actively trying to prevent: Goliath formed a bond of trust with a human other than Xanatos himself.

The second failure is a result of being untrustworthy. He creates another smarter, stronger version of himself, in Thailog. This is almost identical to Tom Riddle's mistake of creating another Riddle for companionship, and HPMOR is generally considered rational. Maybe a rational story could be told about a Xanatos who, being trustworthy when trying to duplicate himself, can reach a more trusting relationship with Thailog, and gain more through cooperation, but it wouldn't produce that much of a change in the overall story arc. And besides, Xanatos /likes/ a challenge; I don't think he's displeased at all to have Thailog out there as a rival to himself.

Finally, the Oberon issue was completely unforeseeable without foreknowledge of the identity of Fox's mother. And, even so, he was so prepared to be attacked that he /won/ that fight, pretty handily, and even exploited it as an excuse to reconcile with the Manhattan Clan.

Could the other antagonists be rewritten to be more rational? Definitely. Demona and Macbeth certainly could (although Macbeth takes a turn down that path himself when he turns away from his literally-suicidal obsession with killing Demona); so could the Archmage, and most of Oberon's Children that have shown up.

And the Gargoyles themselves often win through brute strength and just through being in what seems to be a much more just world than ours is; rarely do they outwit anyone smarter than the Pack or the Steel Clan.

But Xanatos? He's pretty much the prototypical rational antagonist, and rarely comes out of a scheme having risked more than what he was willing to lose. It would be hard to improve much upon him.

*** If I wrote a rational!Gargoyles, I'd much rather make the gargoyles cleverer. This might be a bit too much "Giving Frodo a lightsaber without giving Sauron a Death Star," but tbh, I think Xanatos could handle it. >:P

That, or just focus on [[https://gargoyles.fandom.com/wiki/Matrix][the semi-rogue A.I. who was only narrowly convinced to substitute "tiling the universe with it-shaped paperclips" for "tiling the universe with law and order as explained to it by a former criminal and mercenary"]], and for some reason was never heard from again (until the comics, anyway).

**** Xanatos could definitely handle a cleverer Manhattan Clan. It would force him to up his own game a bit, but he'd consider that a bonus.

The rest of their adversaries need upgrades, though. Demona has no ability to delay gratification, Macbeth isn't much better, Oberon has so much phenomenal cosmic power that everything looks like a nail to him, and without Fox or Coyote to lead them, the Pack's most intelligent member is Dingo, who isn't /stupid/, but certainly doesn't play on the same level as even Demona and Macbeth do.

Thailog would be fine as an adversary for cleverer Gargoyles, but he'd need his own Owen equivalent; the fact that he has no one intelligent and trustworthy as an ally limits his potential.

I like the idea of Thailog as "Smarter, but less trustworthy, version of Xanatos." Not that r!fic is supposed to be didactic, but it'd still be interesting to drive forward the point that Xanatos is ultimately a bigger threat than Thailog because, while Thailog outclasses him in a lot of ways on a one-to-one basis, Xanatos can actually inspire people's loyalty and maintain a healthy organizational climate.

I would have Macbeth and/or Demona lean into their immortality more heavily and pull stunts which only succeed because they can't die. Also, just make them more skilled. Demona should learn some impulse control, but ultimately, we don't see them do much more than shoot lasers and operate complex machinery, but they've had a thousand years in which to learn new stuff.

If I had to strongly differentiate them, which is probably a good idea from a storywriting perspective, then I'd make them "wide vs tall," i.e. one of them picked up a /lot/ of skills, while the other has focused on a few specific skills and continually worked on them to the point that, in those domains, they utterly outclass everyone else because, you know, they have /a thousand years of practice/.

Probably Macbeth and Demona respectively, because I can easily see Macbeth picking up all kinds of trades over the generations and adding them to his repertoire one by one, and Demona obsessing over a few key skills. Since Demona was learning magic even before the rest of the clan was killed or petrified, she is probably /the/ most capable magic-user on the planet short of (some of) the Children of Oberon.

Not sure what to do with the Pack, but part of me is fine with leaving them as patsies whose intelligence doesn't rise higher than "will never hold the Idiot Ball."

  Demona has no ability to delay gratification
#+end_quote

Don't know, that seems such a key part of her personality. She's extremely passionate and impulsive, and that too is why she's so quick to hate humanity and sweepingly generalise their flaws. A more reflexive, thoughtful, patient Demona would just not have become a villain at all, she'd have stayed at Goliath's side (though, note, I'm still early in S2 in my rewatch, and haven't seen her backstory for the years passed in between the curse and the present, which I don't remember. So my opinion may change).

****** She's literally had /a thousand years/ since the fall of Cattle Wyvern to learn patience, the vast majority of that after she and Macbeth had parted ways.

I don't think the show goes much into what happened to her after that and before Awakening, aside from recurring conflicts with the Hunters.

I don't think the most important part of Demona's character is that she's passionate and impulsive; I think she's defined by being egotistical, power-hungry, and by using her hatred for humanity as a coping mechanism, to allow her to avoid her own responsibility for the destruction of her clan. If it's their fault, it can't possibly be hers.

That last isn't exactly rational, but I think it could be retained in a rational fic for exploration.

******* Well, the defining trait of a rational fiction should be that the /world/ is rational, not that the characters all are. Demona doesn't strike me as intrinsically unbelievable, though given her age, I guess as you say, being so impatient seems a weird trait to retain.

***** Yeah. Cleverer Manhatten clan just means the conflict is now a battle of wits. And Xanatos has a significant resource and influence advantage to even out their raw powrr.

*** I disagree.

A good way to improve Xanatos as a rational character would be for him to have actual /plans/, where he's trying to accomplish objectives and going through multiple steps to move towards them.

Much of what he does in the show (at least in the early seasons) is antagonize the gargoyles for no reason, get his ultra-expensive military hardware wrecked as a result, and shrug it off with "Eh, I'm rich anyway, let's call this a field test".

Though the part where he gets his girlfriend out of prison is pretty clever.

**** Yeah, it's not that Xanatos isn't smart or rational in himself, but the show doesn't seem (to this point, I'm at the episode where Coldstone revives but his mind is taken over by a computer virus) to really have such a complex long term plan, so most of what he does is episodic bullshit where he rationalises his loss as "meh I have backups". Plus other aspects of the show are less than rational anyway (why did he even need to study real Gargoyles to build the Steel Clan, which is just... Gargoyle-shaped robots? I'd have understood if he needed a sample of their genetic material to clone them...). It's still a lot of fun, and I really enjoy Goliath too - he's got a real ethic, personality, values and flaws. He's good but won't shy away completely from anger or violence at times, because after all, he IS a +man+ gargoyle of the Middle Ages. There's a lot of good episodes that set up all sorts of interesting conflicts. But the pseudo-science and magic system of the world could be more fleshed out, and having a genuinely rationally written Xanatos interact with them over a long story with a clear endgame in mind but also his traditionally twisted, obliquous plans, would be amazing.

*** Well, I suppose I'm thinking more in terms of the world and schemes itself. There's a reason why the trope of an extremely elaborated plan with multiple possible benefits is called a “Xanatos gambit”... by the criterion so aptly explained by Lucius after seeing the Tragedy of Light, they /are/ a bit too convoluted at times.

Anyway I need to finish my rewatch before I can mull about this properly, I don't remember much beyond the City of Stone arc (I watched this the first time when I was ten years old).
