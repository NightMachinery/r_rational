** Technobabble is kind of cringe worthy, but it's a good popcorn fic (not rational/rationalist).

** So this is getting some upvotes... Is this story enjoyable enough and sufficiently appropriate for this subreddit that I should post new chapters here when I see them? I think so, but I have a soft spot for dragons.

*** The when looking at the number of votes for a post, the most common (or the mode) seems to be around 12. So I'd recommend waiting 24 hours from when you first posted this to see if it reaches that number before deciding to post future chapters.

Or just wait for another 2-3 chapters to be published and if it's still fitting for the subreddit in your opinion, repost it here. I tend to do one of these two things.

*** Speaking purely personally, I'm enjoying it enough that I've subscribed through FF.net and would be interested to see discussion threads as the story progresses.

That said, the last couple of chapters had almost consecutive "Oh no, I did something totally counter-productive in a haze of awkwardness or because a pretty girl smiled at me" moments. Which feels like a nascent/growing idiot-ball for the main character, and would undermine calling it strictly rational unless he learns his lesson and corrects the problem before it becomes the main driver of the plot.

Still fun though, and not everything posted here is strictly rational; some just fall into a similar sphere of interests, and AI dragons seems like it fits that description.
