** Feels like it has been too long since our last Delphic chapter. I was supremely pleased with all of the food descriptions and how they were used tell a bit of the story.

** Another superb Delphic chapter. Great descriptions of food and just a hint too short. Can't wait to read them all in a row after completion.

** I am still really, really suspicious of this girl. Hector is apparently such an open book, and it hasn't come up until now? He never realized it ever, over the course of his entire life? Paris never teased him about it? His dad never told him to work on his poker face?

Nah. I mean, he probably is pretty easy to read, but this is going beyond mind-reading. Everything about the way this girl is portrayed points very, very firmly in the direction of mind reading. And now, just when he was perhaps suspicious enough to go home and spend a night Viewing her past to corroborate her story, she finds a way to make him not only no do that, but also take her to his house?

From a paranoid point of view, this is getting a bit ridiculous. Its all in character, true, but the extent to which Hector is risking everything by his reluctance to just spend some time Viewing this girl is stressing me out.

Excellent chapter! Though perhaps you could go a bit more into detail on why Hector is so reluctant to use his power on Kimberly, when he uses it so freely on everyone else he deals with?

** Spoiler comments: So, nice to see a LITTLE pushback from Delphic about the outrageously accurate absolutely constant mindreading, but then my opinion plummeted back down after he decided 'well, sure, I'm not going to trust her, but we can go back to my place to have more sex'.

*** Sideline comment: Dealing with suspected mindreading, that's the point at which you start thinking to yourself 'Well, I suppose we can go back to my place, and afterwards, I can just [thoughts of horrible inflicted violence] her just like all the others.' and see just how quickly she backs out before calling her out on it. Or think really really hard about how you've drugged her drink as you offer her water at home. Same thing.
