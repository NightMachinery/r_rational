Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

He's a good storyteller with a focus on analytics that I really appreciate. There's a focus on outliers and statistical oddities that I find compelling. (A lot of SB Nation's stuff is really good for people who aren't into sports, and I've been steadily adding things to my various idea boards for stories that are in their planning stages.)

** I'm moving to another country for six months!

Anyone have advice for what I absolutely must do/bring/buy to make my 21 hours of travel (6 hour flight, 2 hour layover, 13 hour flight) bearable?

(Unfortunately melatonin is only available by prescription here and is very expensive. I'm considering buying over the counter sleeping tablets to help me sleep on the plane but am worried about being too groggy during the layover and when I land and have to clear customs.)

--------------

Anyone have advice on what I should/shouldn't pack?

I'm packing clothes (selected carefully to all match and be appropriate for anything from lounging around the house to a job interview), a laptop (to be my computer over there) + mouse, phone, kindle, travel adapters, a phone power bank, chargers for everything, a SIM card that works internationally, personal hygiene items (toothbrush/menstrual cup/etc), glasses (normal/spare/sunglasses). And lots of snacks for the plane.

It's interesting as it's much less stress to pack for this move than it is for a shorter holiday as I can't carry my entire life in 25kg so I'm going to need to acquire stuff over there (renting a furnished room should hopefully mean I get linens but buying cheap linens and towels is far from a prohibitive expense for me...)

*** Bring a good book. On paper, not electronically, so you can read it on the plane while your electronic devices are all switched off.

If you're looking for something new, I can strongly recommend the Chanur series by C.J. Cherryh (if you haven't read it yet) - though note that it /does/ need to be read in order.

Otherwise I have some of my favourite fanfictions on there, The Martian which is always good to inhale in a couple of hours, all of Animorphs, and a bunch of books I haven't read yet. So I should hopefully manage!

*** Two huge QoL items:

Soft earplugs - makes sleeping in the plane reasonable instead of miserable from sudden noises and talking, improves reading ability and enjoyment when people are talking around you, and might help you sleep wherever you're staying once you get there. They're tiny and cheap, bring a few.

A firm neck pillow - get a wrap around neck pillow that is as firm as possible and ideally can button or zip in the front. Having something that lets you rest your head on your shoulder comfortably makes sleeping while sitting up infinitely better. Just don't get suckered by really soft ones, it's not a real pillow it needs to hold your head off your shoulder comfortably.

Also bring and wear layers of clothes so you can shed or add them to your comfort. Planes tend to be cool.

Best of luck in a new country! I've never heard of melatonin being a prescription drug, you might be able to find supplements that naturally boost it. Tart cherry juice for example?

Also if you want to jump right into the local time and avoid jetlag I find doing a 1 day fast works well. You will be sleepy initially, then a boost of energy for about 12 hours, and finally you will get very sleepy. Get up the next day, eat a big breakfast, and you'll be well on your way adjusted to the local time if that's an issue for you.

**** OK based entirely on your recommendation I went shopping yesterday and picked up earplugs (easy), and went looking at neck pillows. I found some pretty firm looking memory foam ones for $15 and was like "this isn't too bad" when I tried them.

Then I went to a department store. I saw they had the $15 ones but they also had [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Go-Travel-Ultimate-Memory-Pillow/dp/B01G8IHX7A][this monstrosity]] for $55. I laughed and was like "There's no way this is three times better than the other ones" and I attached it to my head and..... it was like a flight of angels came in and started supporting my head from all directions, gently carressing me with their feathery wings.

OK, maybe not quite that good, but it was like night and day. And I figure it's either a worthy investment if it's excellent, and if it's shit it's proof for the rest of my life that neck pillows aren't something I benefit from investing in. I also grabbed a new sleep mask as there was a 20% off when buying two or more products from the line and I don't have a sleep mask with cavities for the eyes (I use sleep masks all the time at home but when I wake up there's been pressure on my eyes all night so my vision is blurry for 5-10 minutes which I can't imagine is healthy?).

I just wanted to let you know that your advice was listened to and will either be responsible for me having a much more pleasant flight or will be the annoying thing I have to cart all around my travels and regret buying :P

  avoid jetlag
#+end_quote

My experience with jetlag is if I'm in the sun I don't feel tired, but if I'm indoors I do, so I'm not too worried.

I arrive about 7am local time so my plan is to get an uber, put all my crap in an airbnb, and then just walk around / sit in parks / dining al fresco / etc enjoying the sunshine until about 5pm or 6pm, scarf something quick for dinner and then go back to my airbnb and sleep for ~10-12 hours, wake up at 4am, and then (hopefully!) be all reset - I tend to go to naturally be a morning lark so it should work out (fingers crossed).

*** Yo MagicWeasel! All the best for the journey! Did you get a good layover airport?

For flight: your own comfortable headphones! You have the glorious option to spam movies the entire flight, makes subjective time in flight very short, and the crappy free ones will hurt after 10 minutes.

And electronic devices can nowadays be used during the flight, just not landing, so don't worry too much about paper books. That includes the laptop for example, so download offline DCSS ;-)

Pack a warm jacket. At night the airplane gets real cold and the thin blankets don't cut it. I run pretty cold, so YMMV, but I was SO happy about my big fleece jacket. A hood also gets you a bit of placebo privacy from your seat neighbours. In addition to RetardedWabbit earplugs, bring a mask/shawl to get darkness when you want it.

Depending on your dietary preferences, snack selection: I had it happen to me on the long flight NZ->germany that there were no vegetarian options left, so if you are strict pack a bit more.

Otherwise the travellers credo: pack light and carry a credit card.

And hit me up for your Berlin weekend!

Done and done! I have bone conduction headphones and also "sleepphones" which is essentially a headband with speakers in them. Both are bluetooth though so I can't directly hook them up to the inflight system and I don't have digital or analog adapters for those. So IDK. We'll see how we go.

I also run pretty cold. I've got my warm jacket in my suitcase ATM but I think I'll wear it on the plane as you're right, it's probably the way to go (plus I'll be leaving probably on a chilly enough day that it'll be useful)

Already pre-ordered the vegan meal and triple checked but I'll probably check it another couple of times. Hopefully the airline doesn't screw up, but if they do, I'll be bringing a TON of snacks

It's a shame you're not here this weekend. The [[http://www2.torontocomics.com/][Toronto Comic Arts Festival]] is happening Saturday and Sunday, probably my single favourite weekend every year. It's a free festival hosted at a huge public library, and unlike most other festivals/conventions it's actually about comics, mostly indie comics, and not superheros and video games and cosplay and merch/souvenirs. Artists and writers come from all over the world for it, and there are a bunch of workshops, panels and lectures on cool, niche topics, ranging in tone from casual to academic.

Example: take the dinotopia universe, if you were shipwrecked and could wash up with references (they are water damaged so you have to rewrite/redraw) what would they be? Periodic table, specific statistic or math charts, simplified diagrams/blueprints, whatever.

For those unfamiliar, dinotopia is by James Gurney. Sentient dinosaurs living alongside humans, preexisting society and culture.

I'd also recommend an emergency medical guide, but you might have to go civilian to find one useful without gear, training, or support. The "Austere Emergency Medical Support Field Guide" by USA Homeland security is the best one I know of but requests EMR, EMT, ALS, and wilderness training for all levels. It's also the most useful with gear. Maybe there's a civilian prepper/apocalypse guide that assumes no gear or prior knowledge?

This often serves as the foundation for one's identity and relationship to society as people mature and grow up.

Yes, if there is someone who grows up isolated from society or any interaction with another person, I would argue that the individual in question would not have a gender of any sort (biological sex is another thing entirely).
