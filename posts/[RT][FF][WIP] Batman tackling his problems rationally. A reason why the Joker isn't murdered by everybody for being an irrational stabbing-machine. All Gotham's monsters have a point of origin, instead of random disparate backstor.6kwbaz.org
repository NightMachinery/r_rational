Converting in truth, you need to add scene descriptions etc.

**** It's true that it's against the rules but it doesn't seem like the mods care much. I've had multiple script-form stories up there for about six years now and nary a peep.

Honestly, my impression is that the site is running on autopilot. I don't think there's much moderation and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of new code development. (Then again, I haven't been interacting regularly for a while now, so maybe I've missed something.)

** This is a lot better than I was expecting it to be. I suggest describing the definition of an extinction burst in the story summary so that people know that you're referencing a psychology term rather than trying to make your story sound cool. That was the impression that I'd gotten, personally, and it was almost enough to turn me away.

#+begin_quote
  Author's Note: Extinction burst refers to the concept of eliminating a behavior by refusing to reinforce it.
#+end_quote

Not quite. That is just extinction. Extinction burst is a specific phenomenon where when the reinforcement is removed the occurrence of the behaviour will decline until a surge in behaviour occurs (the so called extinction burst). If no reinforcement is provided for the surge then the behaviour soon reaches near-complete extinction.

Lets say a kid throws tantrums in order to get candy from his/her parents. The parents decide they have had enough and won't give the kid candy when the kid throws tantrums. Throwing tantrums is the behaviour, getting candy is the reinforcer for the kid. When the kid no longer gets candy for the tantrums the behaviour will become less common until the kid decides to throw a super tantrum (The extinction burst) in case just trying harder will work. If that doesn't work then the kid will give up (The behaviour will become extinct). If it does then the kid will keep doing the behaviour

** Wonderful story, though I'm curious why "the Batman" aspect of Bruce Wayne's psyche hasn't fought back against Bruce's attempts to move beyond it. I can see Wayne losing the fire of his motivations and seeking new ways to realize his goals, but part of being the Batman is an utterly indomitable will. That willpower should be nearly as strong facing up against apathy as it is fighting weaknesses of the body.

If Bruce Wayne's psyche is fractured enough, that is a fight he will have to engage in at some point.

***** Not exactly, since Batman crafted the Bruce Wayne persona, instead of it being imprinted on by someone else. Each side knows the other's purpose and utility.

I look at Batman removing his mask on top of the GCPD as an act of melding between the two aspects, giving leeway for a Bruce to become heroic.

** Very well done! Definitely going to be reading more of this :) Two quick notes you may already be aware of:

#+begin_quote
  "What kind of therapist would say that shit?" "Not a good one; never during a session."
#+end_quote

You might be surprised :) Usually it would require a good rapport between the client and therapist first, but that kind of blunt borderline-insulting honesty is a tool like any other in the therapist's toolkit, and I've used it to great effect, particularly with younger clients who appreciate someone calling them on their shit in a humorous way. A response he might give instead is:

"Never during a first session. But we're already friends, so I don't have to wait to build rapport, and we've already decided this isn't a therapy session, so I can be honest and direct without having to spend time building trust. And, honestly, I can see through your bullshit."

#+begin_quote
  "Just because the reinforcement is negative, doesn't mean it's not reinforcement."
#+end_quote

From a technical standpoint, "reinforcement" is the correct word here because it's encouraging behavior, but "negative" is not: Negative reinforcement does not refer to /introducing/ things that are unpleasant, it refers to /taking away/ things that are unpleasant, which is what makes it a reinforcement. In either case, because of the Joker's particular perspective, if he's being described as someone who seeks attention, even in the form of Batman's fists, then Bruce punishing him is /positive reinforcement/ because he's giving him what he wants: to withhold that attention would in fact be a punishment, specifically a Negative Punishment, which is the technical term for "removing a thing that is desired."

It's a bit confusing even for psychologists sometimes, but the rule of thumb is that "Reinforcement" and "Punishment" refer to the thing being desired or not by the person, and "Positive" and "Negative" refer to the action being introduced or taken away. A simple fix to this would to just change the line to:

"Just because the reinforcement is something we'd normally consider harmful, doesn't mean it's not reinforcement."

Again, great chapter, looking forward to reading the rest!

*** Thanks for the notes!

The line about John not saying that is a line I adapted from a therapist roommate I had who would say stuff like that when I teased him about being a 'bad therapist.' (The joke was me being ironic. I'm sure you've gotten the thing where people assume you're treating every human interaction like it's a session, and they act surprised when you say something biting). But you have a good point. I don't think John would "never" say that in a session. In fact, I think the line may be contradictory to things the character later says.

I was aware of the negative thing. Since Bruce is not a psychologist, he would only be familiar with the common vernacular usage of negative reinforcement. Plus, the sentiment still makes sense, since the reinforcement is literally "negative," ie, not conducive.

Again, I agree with your note. The way it is now is too confusing, and John probably wouldn't think to use the common usage. And it's a case where it sounds like I'm wrong to people like you who know the real terminology that John would know.

** YEH! This good! Minor spelling/grammar issues here and there, but otherwise written as what writer intends on saying.

How did Fear Gas counter the arcane? That part could use a bit more explanation and detail, either that or I missed something.

As far as the entire story is concerned I get what you're going for, aiming for Deconstruct with character behavior focus. It can be great, so long as you update and give actual resolutions, in a sense that characters end up different characters than their comic originals.

I will say I am not a fan of what happened to Moth man, would prefer the OG version of a guy fighting in a moth costume. I mean thats just so awesome not to have in a book! Who knows maybe someone else takes up the mantle as a legacy?

So far it's simply not explained yet why the fear gas trumped the "arcane," as Batman himself doesn't know why. But I might want to add the fact that Batman is confused, rather than just lack the information altogether.

****** What is batman's superpower? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NG3n_gONws][He's rich]]. His prowess as a superhero comes from a) his martial arts training and b) his ultra high-tech costume.

First, costume. The cost of such things is mostly R&D. Once it is developed, it's possible to produce them.

Second, martial arts. He trained for about 15 years, which is long, sure, but there are plenty of people who train more. And people in army/police special ops teams are among them.

So here is the thing. Instead of going vigilante, he should have funded a creation of a special police force, and then equipped them with his costumes. At the same time, Bruce would have more time for developing even better varians of the armor. Moreover, being police, they wouldn't have to face the complications of vigilantism. And one of them could actually shoot Joker for, you know, resisting arrest.

Such a ploy would never work in a comic - this force would be essentially an elite mook squad, good only for being slaughtered. But we are talking rational here, and there is no doubt that a hundred professional batmans would be miles beter than a single one who does it as a glorified hobby.
