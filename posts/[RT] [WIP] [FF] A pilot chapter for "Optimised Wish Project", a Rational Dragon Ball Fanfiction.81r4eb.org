So, I've just finished writing this first chapter and wanted to hear a bit of opinions or have some debate in the hope it would give me more inspiration or ideas about how to develop it further:

[[https://www.dropbox.com/s/okezmj5mnohlna8/Chapter1.pdf?dl=0]]

The premise is Dragon Ball, except that Goku's little cranial trauma incident gave him a much higher intellect and a penchant for philosophy. In the vein of HPMOR, this isn't the only change - there are a few more ret-cons planned here and there (you can see that Bulma too is a bit different from the original) mostly for the sake of a more enjoyable and surprising story, or a more logically consistent world.

As it stands, the Dragon World just isn't very consistent to begin with, and obviously does not operate on our established laws of physics, so I will not insist on that aspect of it, which is why I haven't marked this as Rationalist, but merely Rational. I don't think I'd be up to snuff, even though I have some ideas about how to justify some of the most outrageous things, and fix some others. My other big issue with going on with this is length - writing is fun, and this would be a good chance to stretch my muscles a bit after years of not doing it, but this kind of story would also be a /huge/ undertaking, given the size and scope of the Dragon Ball universe. Right now I have plans for the entirety of the Pilaf arc, but wouldn't want writing a story like this to become a chore rather than an enjoyment. Which is why I'd like some feedback to get hyped up and possibly go on a roll with new ideas XD. If it all sits only inside my head it isn't as fun. I haven't published this on Fanfiction.net yet because I would like to only start doing so when I have a few more chapters under my belt, so I have some breathing space for updates. I can't promise when they would be uploaded, so only read knowing I can't guarantee a when and where for any future updates.

Thanks in advance for all advice and criticism!


** I've considered writing some rational fic for Dragon Ball myself, but it's an immense challenge. Making it feel both rational and stylistically consistent with canon is difficult, since so many things about the original setting feel like they're either inconsistent, played for laughs, or never explored in detail. So, I commend your efforts at taking a stab at this, and I'll be interested to see how you handle it.

That said, I do have some initial feedback, mostly in regards to your characterization of Bulma.

This is tricky, because I realize you're trying to be consistent with Bulma's original goal in Dragon Ball (wish for a boyfriend), which is inherently problematic in a lot of regards.

I have a difficult time believing that Bulma has not been able to find intellectual equals. A portion of this comes down to how much you want to expand on the world of the original setting. They appear to have relatively modern levels of technology (with some schizo tech), and modern-style schools /probably/ exist, but I don't think we get a lot of detail about the education system as far as I can recall.

For example, are magnet programs and other forms of education designed for intelligent young students available? What sorts of college education are available?

If so, I'd expect her to be able to find intellectual peers through either a high school with a magnet program (maybe even a highly gifted magnet), a private school, or potentially even college if she's a few years ahead of schedule.

I feel like this is something I'd personally want more justification for. Maybe she had a boyfriend and he ran off to [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Android_16%27s_template][join the Red Ribbon Army]]?

A few comments on the wish itself:

- A portion of the wish says, "I, too, will fall in love with him". This appears to reference a portion of the wish that does not exist; there is no implication in the earlier portion of the wish that the person she meets will fall in love with her, merely that the person will be her "boyfriend". I would argue that there is no inherent need for a "boyfriend" to be in love with someone, nor should that be presumed to be automatically granted within the parameters of the wish.
- Toward the end of the wish, you say "hi must be" - this is a typo. It should say "he must be".
- Constructing a wish in such a way that the meeting could "appear to be a coincidence" means that she would have no way of knowing if the Dragon Balls actually served any function at all. That makes this a poor test case if she's attempting to validate the functionality of the Dragon Balls, and it also means that she could potentially meet this random person under circumstances in which she does not recognize them as a match.

I do like that she goes through multiple iterations of the wish and that we see her thought process - that's a good approach.

Goku's dialogue comes across as a little inconsistent. His dissertation on the uselessness of giving out his name doesn't feel like it matches the style of the rest of his dialogue, which is a little more brief (no pun intended).

Bulma's analysis that "human muscles should not be able to do that" seems a little iffy to me, but a part of that comes down to how well people understand peak human capabilities within the setting. Master Roshi would have already won at least one Tenkaichi Budōkai by this point, for example, and as far as I understand it those things are broadcast on television within the setting. While the average person doesn't seem to know about ki, there may be a general understanding that human capabilities have upper limits that are much higher than what we have on our Earth. For example, Master Roshi has a similar power level to Mr. Satan, who can [[https://youtu.be/U3xroTMVnRA][punch through a bus]]. So, I think beating up a car with a blunt object would be considered a high-end physical feat, but not necessarily impossible.

Also, if Bulma has fantastic resources at her disposal (e.g. enough money to "wipe out East City's public debt with pocket money", why is she traveling without bodyguards? Does she have anyone monitoring her location? Does she have some motivation to be "adventuring" without anyone else?

Your rational!Goku has (understandable) questions about the existence of heaven. Since they're in the middle of a conversation about wish-granting objects when this comes up, why not have him consider using the Dragon Balls to verify the existence of the afterlife in some way? Or even verify if that's the afterlife that Grandpa went to?

If this is supposed to be a rational!Bulma, I'd want her to (at least eventually) realize that she can do a lot more with a wish than get a boyfriend. That might help justify the /extreme/ risks she's taking.

I'd also take issue with Bulma's concept that science makes sense and magic doesn't. In a world where magic exists and has reliable and knowable rules, they're not really all that distinct. Magic is just another form of special technique at that point.

Actually, Goku's magic item - Nyoibō - is a great example of that. It's functionally very similar to Bulma's capsule technology; it expands and contracts on demand.

A couple more quick typos:

- Search for "concluded Goku". You're missing some punctuation there.
- Search for "sceptical". This should be "skeptical".

Overall, most of my concerns are related to the source material itself, and attempting to "fix" them means potentially deviating from that source material further. That's a tough call to make, which is part of why I never ended up writing any fanfics like this myself.

I hope this doesn't come across as too harsh, and I commend you for taking up the challenge of trying to do a rational fic for something as difficult as Dragon Ball.

*** Thanks for your criticism and suggestions! Point by point:

- about Bulma not finding intellectual peers, consider that she's not really not found any, she just hasn't bothered looking /that/ much after all. She's 16, and consistently with her original characterisation, occasionally a bit bratty. She's not the most patient person. For me, the boyfriend thing is balanced by the fact that, by this point, she does not /truly/ believe the Dragonballs will work. So the wish is really sort of half-hearted, more of a playing with the idea "what would I wish for if I had an all-powerful dragon listening to me?" than a serious thought. As I tried to imply, really, she's just on the run because she's bored and hopes to get some attention from her parents. This is also the reason why she's alone (there's no doubt that the Briefs are /very/ rich, this is canonical, Bulma throws around money like it's of no concern, especially lately in DB Super where she's basically sponsoring prizes for all ToP participants, and gave away a yacht in a lottery for her birthday). It's a rebellious phase thing. Maybe I could stress that a bit more (a good chance is when she's dealing with Goku's feelings for his dead grandpa). That's my answer to the incongruity of the "boyfriend" wish (also, I really liked the chance to make that Jane Austen reference). As for the wish not being verifiable, you're right, and that's a good idea for further future revisions of the wish itself. I think it makes sense for her to assume that, well, if a dragon appears, the Balls /are/ magical, but however contrived, the hypothesis "a dragon appears but really he can't actually do anything" still needs to be falsified. Good catch, thanks!

- about the Red Ribbon Army, I already have plans in store for them;

- Goku's initial dissertation may be too long, perhaps. I might shorten it, I'll see. Or perhaps make some of his other rants longer, introduce it as a quirk that occasionally kicks in as he loses control of his train of thought. I kind of like it as an introduction, its overbearing nature just hammers down to Bulma /who/ she's dealing with here.

- the strength issue is one of the big contradictions of Dragon Ball. On one hand, everyone is absolutely amazed at seeing Goku & friends and their strength. On the other, as you mentioned, the Tenkaichi is broadcast on live TV. By the time the Buu arc rolls around it's even worse, the tournament is rife with absolute jokes who would have been completely wiped out even just 20 years before (Mr. Satan isn't nearly as strong as Roshi! Roshi could destroy a mountain with a Kamehameha at the very beginning of the show, remember). This contradiction seems to stem from a contrast between a setting that tries to emulate that of the original Journey to the West - a mysterious ancient China where adventure and portents lie behind every corner - and one where instead modern technology shortens distances and speeds up communication. My take on this is that the high level martial arts world is somewhat more secretive. So I'll rather go for example for removing the Live TV element at Tenkaichi later than the other way around. Some people more in the know might be aware of this, but Bulma is finding out about ki and magic, and this stuff isn't found in books (not in reliable ones, at least). She's also pretty young. I guess I'm taking a bit of inspiration from the world of Nen in HXH here (a perfect example of very "rational" superpower system), where most people are on a need-to-know basis with it and knowledge is passed from master to disciple, by oral tradition.

- yes, Goku could think about asking Shenron about the afterlife. He may have already. He's just taking his time, since he has it, and Bulma isn't trying to fixate him on any specific option.

- re: magic, ki and technology, I have some ideas about how and why they work, and what makes them different, and why Bulma (and most humans) only know the last one. I won't spoil here. Let's just say that what surprises her of the Nyoibo is the lack of mechanisms of any kind. It is, superficially, just a stick of wood. Of course there are rules and a logic to these things, they are just not known by Bulma (yet). And since they mostly belong to this mystical world of rather secretive martial artists, masters, and gods, to most it's either unknown, or only known by hearsay, which makes the entire thing not sound very reliable. Basically, the competent people keep their mouth shut, the incompetents only sound like cranks and frauds, and thus reinforce the notion that magic really is just nonsense.

I will not try to "fix" anything too hard concerning the setting, as I would rather this be a Dragon Ball fanfiction than a rational one, and I will be more willing to sacrifice coherence occasionally for the sake of atmosphere rather than the other way around. However the plot /will/ significantly diverge from the original one, while keeping the initial premises similar (for example, out there there really is a Frieza conquering planets; Majin Buu really is sleeping somewhere on Earth; etc.).

  there's no doubt that the Briefs are very rich
#+end_quote

Bulma's parents aren't just rich; they're also /absolute airheads/, the both of them. Her father is the epitome of an "absent professor", and her mom is, as far as I can tell, a trophy wife. Bulma may have learned mechanical engineering on her daddy's knee, but I doubt he was actually intending to raise her to be anything in particular.

Rather, I think they haven't given much consideration to Bulma's needs at all. IIRC, they live a ways out from the city, in a nice huge capsule-mansion with lab-domes and garden-domes and the like. It's likely perfect for /them/, but have they considered how isolating it is for Bulma? I expect not. (What do they think of their daughter taking a car-capsule and wandering off to god-knows-where at the age of 14 for months at a time? Maybe they trust her to know how to take care of herself? Even though she---at the beginning of Dragonball---obviously doesn't have any such skills?)

Likewise, they probably haven't stopped to think about the fact that Bulma is a technical genius. For the both of them, that level of skill is just... normal. They're used to it. So it never occurred to them that Bulma might be intellectually starved.

(except I don't think they live outside the city. When Goku looks for Bulma in Dragonball, he founds her thanks to a cop, and they still seem to be at least in a residential area)

Just a few quick replies.

#+end_quote

That's part of my issue - I'd like to think that a more rational Bulma would have better goals than a boyfriend. Especially when considering the risk vs. reward that would go into something like "run off to find the dragon balls".

I think this might just be an area where you want to stick closer to canon than I would, though, which is fine.

#+begin_quote

I'm glad to hear that. A rational!DBZ really needs to explore the Androids more, imo. They're a huge deal technologically and that's barely touched on in canon.

#+end_quote

Budokai winners in general tend to be somewhere in the same ballpark range as Roshi, even if they don't have access to ki blasts.

Mr. Satan did survive a fight with Tao Pai Pai when he was just a student, and he's presumably considerably stronger as an adult.

It's tough to quantify his abilities in general since a lot of his "feats" are gags, like surviving getting hit by Cell or Buu.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I guess the tricky thing for me is that she already has a device that measures the emissions of a specific type of magical item, so she understands that at least one category of magical item operates (to some degree) under principles she understands.

I'd be interested in seeing her explore that more. Can she study Nyoibo and learn how it works? Can she make something that detects items with similar signatures to Nyoibo? Once she learns about ki, can she make a measuring device before the saiyans arrive?

I guess my point is, she's not necessarily /more rational/. The necessary changes have been made mostly for Goku. I did tweak Bulma a bit, but that's mostly because I want her to be the base for a more enterprising character, and frankly, because I'm not interested in replicating Toriyama's brand of pervy humour. So this Bulma isn't the type to instantly offer to show Goku her panties in exchange for the Dragon Ball. But at the same time, I think most of these changes should boil down to /effects/ of Goku's differences -as their dynamic changes, her whole character evolves in a different direction. Anyway, my point is, Bulma may be smart and quite rational, but she's a human being, so she's not perfect. She has drives and emotions that /do/ blind her to a lot of things. And it's not like the last word on her wish has been said. As the prospect becomes more concrete, she might change her mind.

I don't know if I can make that sound satisfying and believable - that's a bit of a tough call. But hopefully I'll make it at least more rounded out and fun, or at least progressive and not completely out-of-nowhere as it was in canon.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Oh, I just found out that's something Toriyama said, huh. Then again, I'm not sure about taking all the man said as canon (S-cells, anyone?). Satan certainly has a good track record taking blows and surviving, but I refuse to consider him as strong as Roshi, seriously. His daughter, Videl, is all but stated to be effectively stronger than him (Gohan thinks so at least), and she's barely got enough ki to summon a small energy ball and fly. She never uses ki to attack, even though she /can/ control it after being trained by Gohan. Roshi could blow up the freakin' Moon with it.

I stated that casually during the chapter, the Dragon Balls simply emit a regular electromagnetic signal. It's just radio waves at a specific frequency, nothing supernatural, which is why everyone and their sister (Pilaf, Red Ribbon) ends up having a radar sooner or later. It's not especially hard to build if you have one to study. Consider it a side effect of sorts, their magic interacting with regular physical laws in weird ways.

And yes, playing with those sort of ideas is definitely in my objectives! I really want Bulma to be a full fledged co-protagonist here. The cast overall will end up being quite different!

Master Roshi can throw powerful energy blasts, but he can't fly at all.

Different people learn different forms of ki control. Master Roshi is good at energy blasts because that's his signature technique.

It's also possible to be extremely powerful and not really use ki blasts at all - Hit and Jiren barely seem to bother with them, for example.

******* The way I see it, ki is some form of energy. There's a stored reserve, and there's a power output, that determines how strong an attack is, and how much it drains the user. Reasonably speaking, lifting a human from the ground requires less energy than destroying a mountain. When Roshi fights Tenshinan, he can't fly, and Tenshinan can. Tenshinan is only slightly stronger than him, the gap isn't huge. But both can destroy large objects with ki. My idea is that technique only determines how one manipulates and shapes ki. Something like flying might require low raw power, but a lot of fine control. Remember that even Goten could go SSJ, and thus be easily a planet-buster, but could not fly. On the other hand, as far as throwing ki goes, the technique only concerns the 'shape' of an attack. For example, the Kamehameha always looks pretty much the same. But when Roshi first uses it, it blows up a mountain; when Goku does it, it wrecks a car. Same technique, different power output. When Cell used the same attack at maximum power, he claimed it could blow up the entire Solar System.

Maybe having less technique means being less efficient, and wasting more energy. But still, I will work on the assumption that flying, done well, takes far less ki than destroying a planet.

******** I'd agree that flying takes less ki than blowing up a planet, no question. I'd just argue that "energy blast" is a distinct technique that appears to take humans a certain period of time to learn.

Krillin, for example, has trouble using the kamehameha after three years of training with Master Roshi and entering the 22nd Budokai. Krillin is probably comparable to Roshi's power level at this point (Goku and Tienshinhan are stronger than Roshi), but Krillin still has problems using energy blasts. His fight with Chaotzu is a good illustration of this; he can barely get an energy ball out at all at first, and when he does manage to pull off the technique, it barely has any punch.

********* Well, yes, though as many things in DB it quickly goes "So Last Season", and Gohan for example learns it basically on his own when in the wilderness whereas it used to be a big deal. There's an impression that the more powerful you are, the easier these things come, probably because you can just afford to do them in a more wasteful way and technique isn't that important any more.

But I was referring to a specific scene. When Gohan teaches Videl to fly, the first thing he does is teach her to control her ki. This is illustrated by her keeping her hands in a cup shape and focusing, and when she succeeds, a faint glow appears. Basically, she is creating the equivalent of a ki blast. Except it's so weak it'd probably barely tickle. In order to make one big enough to blow up a mountain, you need to possess enough /energy/ to blow up a mountain.

My idea is that ki blasts overcome the physical limitations of muscle. In other words, even at amazing energy levels, there's only so much power muscle can output (though it's obviously stronger than the limit assumed by most humans). We've never seen anyone blow up a planet with a raw punch. So the strongest fighters have, potentially, a lot of energy stored inside them that they can only let off in small bursts with physical attacks. Enter ki attacks, that can project an arbitrary amount of energy out of the body - and therefore can be so tiring they exhaust a significant percentage, or all, of the fighter's strength. Something we've seen again and again.

Anyway, this was a good thing to discuss, but I guess I'll keep further thoughts to myself from here on, as it's good ideas for stuff that might need to be discussed in-universe :D.

I assume there's some sort of fan-created genotyping explanation for the power-levels of each generation of Saiyans increasing when increasingly mixed with human DNA, right? Something that can be turned into a formula that predicts the power level of generation N at a fixed age?

Well, let's pretend that---despite there being no justification for it beyond Toriyama's whims---the same formula applies to the Nth-generation /plain-old humans/ in the Dragonball universe. (I mean, it really does seem to!) So Videl would be as much stronger than Mr. Satan at a given age than Gohan is stronger than Goku at a given age.

Then, if you can figure out Videl's average power-level across any fights she appears in, you can run the formula backward to get Mr. Satan's power level.

I'm sure there are people who have /tried/ to figure this out, but it doesn't even seem consistent within the same /character/, let alone the same generation.

Trunks is the easiest example of this.

Mirai Trunks has trouble getting to SSJ1 as a teenager, and it's a huge plot point when he actually gets there. This is with both training from someone who already has SSJ1 (Gohan) and combat experience against people of a comparable or higher level (the androids).

Chibi Trunks gets SSJ1 off-screen as a small child with virtually no training.

Future!Gohan is a similar example; a much older, battle-tested version of him isn't able to hit SSJ2, but the main timeline version of him does just shortly after hitting SSJ1 for the first time.

Super invalidates this pretty badly; the pure Saiyans are far above the half-Saiyans pretty consistently, with the possible exception of Future Trunks, who has had to solo every threat in his timeline.

Power levels fluctuate drastically within someone's lifetime, though.

Take Krillin as an example. He's listed at 206 in the beginning of Z. After training, he's at 1770 for the fight with Vegeta. By the end of the Frieza saga, he's listed at around 75,000.

With that much variation in an individual's power, we can't reasonably work backward from another person - people in this series sometimes go up in power by a factor of 50 or more in a single day.

That these two species look so much alike and /can interbreed/, and have fertile (and stronger!) offspring, despite supposedly evolving on two planets light years away from each other without any contact, is a bit too much for my suspension of disbelief.

******* Hypothesis 1: instant translocation used to be commonplace.

Hypothesis 2: the Saiyans are to Freeza's species as the Jaffa are to the Goa'uld in /Stargate/. In both cases: they took humans from Earth to use as slaves; genetically-engineered some of them to use as a warrior race; planted those genetically-engineered humans on new planets to create a renewable resource; and hid their origins from them. But Jaffa encounter humans all the time, so their origin has long since been deduced; while Saiyans had never encountered humans (until the beginning of DBZ), so they have no idea they share an ancestry.

******** I have my own headcanon about that really. It ties with other ideas that I planned to use in a different fanfiction that I may never write, and it just came to me that if I DO get that far with this one, I may just use them here.

(but I like Frieza playing the Goa'uld game, one thing I want to do is go more into Frieza's empire politics and structure! The only problem with this hypothesis is that the timeline doesn't fit. Saiyans haven't served Frieza for long - in fact it was old king Vegeta, I believe, who both led the rising against the Tuffles, and stipulated the deal with Frieza. And Frieza certainly did not know or care much about the Earth until Goku & friends happened to unfortunately draw his attention to it. The way everyone speaks about it, it seems like the Earth is in the galactic boons from their perspective)

***** In the manga and early series it's obvious the Tenkaichi is a popular event and the public is just composed of normal people. It's clear that, while some extraordinary feats /have/ been seen in the past, the arrival of Goku & co. heralds the beginning of a new escalation, that culminates in Piccolo and Goku's fight that destroys the ring completely, sends the spectators running for their lives in a panic, and brings forth the end of the Tenkaichi (for understandable safety reasons) for many years, until the Cell Games, that are inspired by it.

There's not a really coherent explanation. People have very short memories in this universe, as at the end of Dragon Ball they were saved by Goku from King Piccolo, saw him destroy a city with his bare hands, yet when Cell appears and Goku confronts him only the King recognizes him, and everyone seems to go along with Mr. Satan's explanation that it's "all tricks".

But yes, I think the general idea that it's just a more secluded world, and intellectuals and scientists just don't bother mixing enough to realise what's going on there is the only one that makes half sense. It's not super believable but it should be a good compromise between the setting and needs of the story.

** A nitpick about your post, both RT and RST (using the sidebars descriptions) require that "The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them."

Your world doesn't need to have "real world" physics, but it should have consistent rules even if it has magic (e.g. HPMOR), runs on game logic (e.g. The Two Year Emperor), etc..

If you create a consistent set of rules for your fic it can easily be rationalist (again using the sidebar description), you don't need to worry about using "our physics", but you should showcase rationality itself on the story.

*** Well, I will obviously try to keep any rules consistent, fixing Toriyama's most blatant mistakes like having Shenron change the number of wishes he can grant from one time to the other without logic. What I meant is, I can create some high-level rules and stick to them, but I don't think I can possibly make up anything that's clever enough to hold up under /serious/ scrutiny while being minimally faithful to the world, so I don't think I can afford to make the story itself merely about, say, Bulma trying to understand scientifically how ki works, or something like that - though it will be at least touched upon. So basically the puzzle-like aspect of scientific discovery, and the application of rationalist methods, can't really be the focus of the story.

They ask him however if this way he'll end up being like Polunga, who can only resurrect one person at a time, and he says yes, so in order to have him be powerful enough to resurrect multiple ones, he has to downgrade him, and go down to only two wishes. When the Cell Games are over, they wish for two things: to resurrect all the victims of Cell, and to remove the bombs from #17 and #18.

Next thing you know, the Buu arc rolls around, and Shenron can grant three wishes like Polunga. It's not critically important because they only use one of them /during/ the actual arc, everything else is post-battle fixing shit, like erasing Majin Buu's memory from humanity, but Toriyama himself basically said he forgot.

His canon personality is his natural state, so it would make sense for him to retain that personality in the afterlife (or after being brought back to life in perfect health).)
