**** Unsong is fantasy, but as far as fantasy goes, it has pretty consistent logic and magic. You could say the same of HPMoR, or even some sci-fi stuff: after all, the only fully consistent scientific and technological system we know is our own. Start introducing new rules, there's bound to be /some/ contradiction at some level, unless you worked them all out from a theory of everything. Usually we settle for the rules as stated to be more or less consistent, we don't go much into meta-rules, meta-meta-rules, etc.

***** I'd actually mark Unsong as being on the far "soft" end of soft-hard magic spectrum. A lot of it is glued together from different ideas that the author had and wanted to exist in the same world, rather than natural outgrowths of a rules-based system or much coherent logic.

Edit: Just to be clear the "every idea the author had" thing was explicitly posted to Scott's tumblr some time ago, when Unsong was running. I can't find it now, partly because tumblr sucks for searching, partly because Scott increased the privacy settings to require login. A link/quote would be appreciated, if someone has more time/dedication/patience to find one.

If you gathered up all of the component parts of Unsong that had appeared in previous blog posts (either LJ, tumblr, or his blog), I think you'd have something like half the book, maybe more, if you're just counting kernels.

***** I like unsong, and I think there's something appealing-to-rational-fic-fans about the way it pokes fun at stuff and about the way some of its characters think. But it really isn't very consistent or predictable at all.

Whenever a character is doing advanced kabbalah magic (stuff sohu or uriel can do), you just have to roll with whatever they say is possible.

All the kabbalistic reasoning is really there to make the meta-textual point that you can connect the dots for just about anything when the space of connections you're searching through gets big enough. You can't use it to /actually/ make predictions about what will happen in the story.

Placebomancy is based off of narrative logic, but that really just means the author can do whatever they want and then say "hey, this was a narrative, so it worked".

Good-at-everything prodigal child attends magic school. All the women want him, all the men want to be him. Constantly pining for and worshipping the manic pixie girl. Only temporarily fails at anything in order to set up how brilliant he is at coming back from any setback.

He's a hero, an archetype, a force of nature. When Kvothe has mind-blowing awesome sex with Felurian, that's not because Kvothe is the vehicle for the reader's wish-fulfillment, it's because he's the foil for the reader's own capabilities. We're not meant to empathize with him. We're meant to be slapped in the face by his alien nature. It's not titillating except in the sense that watching a tornado is titillating.

**** Can you give me one example of his supposed good world building or writing style? I can give dozens of examples of his story and world building and style of writing being utter trash.

Sympathy is juvenile and simple to the point of being insulting to the reader. I've never read a system of magic as boring and childish.

The worst part of it is the multiple pages of dialogue in the music bar between kvothe's group and the manic pixie girl where they explain in excruciating detail to pixie girl (actually to the reader, which is the insulting part) how sympathy works. A classic shitty style of writing where the author forgot the "show, don't tell" rule and just explains his whole magic system in a long diatribe. Just awful. The insulting part is that he thinks the reader is too stupid to understand it without this long dialogue. The entire sympathy magic is summed up in two sentences:

Use willpower to cause an effect on something which causes the same effect on a similar item. The higher the similarity between your piece and the target piece, and the closer together they are, the easier it is to cause the effect to the target piece.

That's it. It's the sort of magic system a middle schooler comes up with and thinks is really innovative. It's boring, simple, and juvenile.

The only magic in the book that seems complex and neat is alchemy. And Rothfuss just uses it as a one time Deux ex Machina for Kvothe to solve some temporary setback, and then Rothfuss literally, LITERALLY, has one of his secondary characters make Kvothe say, out loud, the exact sentence "I know nothing about alchemy" in order to cop out of having to explain anything about alchemy in his story. Then Rothfuss has Kvothe relay that exact sentence to the Chronicler in order to get it into the book that the reader is holding, as insurance against the reader calling out Rothfuss about anything to do with alchemy in the story.

Rothfuss is directly telling the reader that he's using alchemy to solve a plot point and is never going to explain anything about it.

But spends loads of screen time explaining his basic bitch magic directly to the reader instead of just showing how it works. Because obviously the reader is too stupid to get it without the dialogue crammed in there.

And it's so ham-fisted. Rothfuss could have had Kvothe explain to the Chronicler directly how sympathy works, cutting out the thin, insulting veil, but instead has Kvothe relay a long, irrelevant section of dialogue to the Chronicler. It has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the story he's telling. It's not like he doesn't skip over massive relevant details in other parts of his story. So why include such an idiotic dialogue about his basic bitch magic?

Rothfuss spends a fair bit of dialogue to establish that EVERYTHING you are reading is coming straight from Kvothe's mouth. Including the fucking cliffhangers at the ends of each chapter.

The 1st layer is old Kvothe, 2nd is old Kvothe telling his story about young Kvothe, 3rd layer is young Kvothe hearing/telling a story about something else. When Kvothe hears the story in the bar, from Skarpi (?), about the war (about the Chandrian) that happened eons ago it feels like something incredibly important. To all other characters in the story, it's just a fun story, but to Kvothe and the reader it reveals a fundamental truth about what their world is really like. Even when Kvothe tells silly short stories to his friends, you feel like you get a feel for his own morality and some understanding about his view of the world.

*** I quite disagree with your criticisms for several reasons. First and foremost, you're looking at it through the wrong lens; you're looking at it as a Harry Potter hero triumphs over adversity kind of story when really it's a tragedy and will end tragically. You have a hero that's really good at most things obviously and repeatedly fuck himself over through arrogance, anger, and recklessness. The triumphs /are setting him up for a fall/.

​

As for sympathy; you lump three criticisms together: simple, boring, and childish. Simple it is, but that's not a bad thing, especially not for rationalists. Complexity frequently brings contradiction, railroading, and plot holes. Neither are intrinsically indicative of good or bad writing; you're merely stating a preference for complexity. Boring and Childish are subjective, although I would say that the primary attribute of childish world-building is that they tend not to think about consequences of their world-building decisions and that has not happened here.

​

As for the scene where one character gets three others drunk and rambling about magic, you were paying attention to the wrong hand in the shell game. Yes it serves as another explanation for the reader, but the thing that makes the scene interesting is not the young blowhards rambling, it's the questions the young lady is asking. She's looking for something, and doesn't really get it from asking them.

​

As for alchemy, it's heavily foreshadowed that it will be used again, multiple times. It's also the skill that Kvothe is teaching Bast.

​

As for examples of writing skill, Rothfuss is excellent at foreshadowing, including a major plot point in slant rhyme in a joking poem or in the dismissive comment of a professor. He uses of metanarrative to create both characterization and make you question the reliability of the narrator. He repeatedly uses names to make jokes about the characters. He uses multiple foils of the main character, as tragedies do, to show different potential paths. He uses constructed etymology to reveal world-building choices. As jokes or characterization, sometimes characters will break into different rhythms or speak in one case speak entirely in iambic pentameter.

  Maybe instead of looking for why the kingkillers are trash, you might look at what about the community makes them so well regarded stories? I could list a couple dozen reasons why I like the kingkiller saga, despite and sometimes because, as you say them using several old patterns.

  Those reasons won't mean anything to you except as anecdotal information, but I do have an example of similarity that might be useful: the tale of 1001 nights is a frame narrative, and the king-killer chronicles uses a similar exploit, both to suspend disbelief and with naming, narrativium, and and honest distrust of the narrator in light of the former, his opponents, and his plight to keep you guessing. I'm still unsure if its playing any deeper than 1.5 levels, but it does keep you guessing.
