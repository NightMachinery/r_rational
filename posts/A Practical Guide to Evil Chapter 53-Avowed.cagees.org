** So Kairos captured Archer and the Rogue Sorcerer? Or are the two out hunting Kairos?

Also, considering that the spot of Black Knight is now open, does that mean the Name of Squire is once again up for grabs? Apprentice as well.

*** Yes in all those counts, same For Heiress/Heir, it would be interesting big Vivian Started coming into Heiress, but considering what the accords say about ruling named, I don't think she would be all that pleased.

***** I'm not sure that Heiress is an exclusively Villain role - It's a transitional name like Squire, and could quite easily fit within a Heroic story.

Then again, we've only known two Heir/esses and they were both Villians (But we've also only known 2 proper Squires, and we know that it can lead into White Knight as easily as Black - We're working with very small sample sizes)

*** It looks like Tyrant took them by surprise on the way out I mean we saw him leave but we haven't seen his army in response to the changes shown. It's especially noticeable when we have seen the Callow, Procer and Dominion Armies doing the thing so it somewhat follows that the plot would then move to the army we haven't had the viewpoint shown.

I'm not sure if the Squire name is up for grabs considering how convuluted its relationship with Cat is currently, we know that there was a broken transition at the end of book three and while she's definitely not the Squire right now, there isn't a lot to suggest that the reappearance of a Name is as fast enough to be relevant to our current situation. At the same time we've heard that the Chancellor name was coming up enough that Black and the other Calamities putting them down was notable so i dunno. I mean if we're putting other Names up for grabs we have to also put like Warlock, any of the Good Names of dead Heroes, whatever Hunter was, Captain, Cursed, Heiress i think? and Thief.

**** People kept going for Chancellor /because/ the Calamities were trying to censor the Name out of existence (somewhat similarly to how Amadeus putting down Heroes preemptively led to them coming out too quickly for him to keep up, at least until his scheme to stop Callowan Heros came to fruition and put an end to it).

 

We aren't going to see a Squire for a generation. No "White Knight" Squire will come up until Hanno starts looking for a replacement (which he won't do in the middle of a war vs the Dead King) or dies. No "Black Knight" Squire will pop up partially because Amadeus and Cat have a thorny relationship with the Name at the moment but also because the "Black Night" Squire also has a clear relationship with the Heir/Heiress Name. And the Heir/Heiress Name itself won't show up not only because it has its own problematic claimant still extant in Akua, but because the Sahelians themselves are in no position to churn out another Name given that the losses from and the effort needed to clean up the clusterfuck that was the fall of Tasia were and are so great they aren't a political entity even now as Praes is coming apart at the seams.

 

While the Heiress/Heir doesn't have to be a Sahelian, the Name clearly has a significant relationship with that line. Akua herself, of course, but also the previous Heir (Ime owes Amadeus because he spared her [after she turned] when going after the Heir and his line, the Sahelians). And I strongly suspect that Subria Sahelian was herself Heiress before she deposed Dread Empress Maleficent. (Indeed generations of Praes became heirs and heiresses to the line and philosophy the crystalized on her ascension- "Iron sharpens Iron.")

*** Captured is such a harsh word. They're his guests, and the armed escorts are just to ensure their protection, since there are forces hostile to them in the area

** You know sometimes i feel like it's too easy to forget the remarks that can come so offhand "the errant participates that took their freedom by force" it makes a lot of sense that they would be of such a martial bent. That they would be willing to as a band of heroes would have been to bend in the face of a greater need. I mean on the one hand that was Grey Pilgrim to a hilt wasn't it? To make the sacrifices for the greater good? And haven't we been told that he follows in the Name and name of the one who founded their nation?

** Archer's getting the Rogue Sorcerer to yoink someone's (probably Kario's) magic to stick in Masego.

Then Masego can usurp reality with usurped sorcery all that way to usurping a god, like, say, the Dead King.

** (Prefacing this with the note that I am enjoying PGtE chapters immensely!)

Am I reading this wrong?

​

“COUNT them ALL, IN the SNOW

RED and GOLD and BLACK as NIGHT

COUNT them ALL, HIGH and LOW

SEven CROWNS broKEN by RITE

BROUGHT they FORTH, IN acCORD

PEACE, OATHS AND A SWORD.”

​

Something in my mind is screaming to replace 'broken' with something two-syllabled that has a down-up stress pattern, like 'accord' lower down or 'aflame', yet for 'aflame' the meaning doesn't fit and 'rent'(/cleft) (by rite) is one-syllabled and would break the delicious meter...

​

(Well, if people can make 'FertiLIZED by ClemenTINE' immortal then maybe I'm asking too much of a children's song.)
