[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ie3aw/biweekly_challenge_the_gamer/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "The Gamer". The winner was [[/u/conradin6622]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ie3aw/biweekly_challenge_the_gamer/dbdgloy/?sort=confidence][The Awakeners]]. Go read it now!

This time, our challenge will be *The Heist*. TvTropes would call this [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper][a Caper]], but the basic premise is that people are stealing something from somewhere. /Mistborn/ was a fantasy take on the trope, while /Inception/ was a high-concept science fiction version of it. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit; your inspiration in this case should be something like Ocean's 11 or The Italian Job.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, January 11th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

Next time, the challenge will be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure#Theoretical][*Megastructures*]]. You're free to interpret what scale qualifies, but most of my favorites go really, really big. For inspiration, see [[https://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/spring_2007/fiction_missile_gap_by_charles_stross][Missile Gap]] by Charles Stross or [[https://www.amazon.com/Ringworld-Del-book-Larry-Niven/dp/0345333926][Ringworld]] by Larry Niven. The Halo from the Halo series would also qualify, as would a large variety of structures present in the Culture series. It's a fairly common trope in scifi. Remember that prompts are to inspire not to limit; write about technical challenges in building such a thing, the experience of living on one, or whatever else you'd like.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 1/11.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5ku8lj/challenge_companion_the_heist/][is available here]].


** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nbEUnv7ZlL0CclZIJx4EsRfYewvk4DmW9F_OhVKtjQ/edit?usp=sharing][With a Little Luck]] (9,542 words).

It's a solo heist in a D&D-inspired fantasy world.

I'm not terribly happy with this one. I think it could be written in half as many words, maybe fewer. However, since it's already taken far too long I'm just going to submit it as is.

It was also written over the duration of the challenge so far (i.e. 11 days), so the beginning may be wildly different in character to the ending. I may go back and edit it, but in all honesty I don't know if the story is worth it. The setting, on the other hand, I may toy around with.
