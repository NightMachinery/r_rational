Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I recently played an interactive fiction story called Choice of Robots, written by Kevin Gold ([[http://www.kevingold.net/personal.shtml]]). I'm not sure that it precisely fits ALL the criteria of rationalist fiction, but it certainly seemed rational adjacent to me, with the caveat that I'm fairly new to rational fiction and the rationalist community in general. Here's a link to the game, which can be played on computer, or purchased from steam or the ios/android app stores. The description of the game is below:

The robots you design will change the world! Will you show them the true meaning of love, or conquer Alaska with your robot army?

Choice of Robots is an epic 300,000-word interactive sci-fi novel by Kevin Gold, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based---without graphics or sound effects---and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.

Play out thirty years of your life as a brilliant robot maker, from graduate school near the present day to a future in which your robots have changed everything. Depending on your choices, your robots may be independent or obedient, clumsy or graceful, empathic or cold...and you yourself may live to an old age happily married or alone with only robots to comfort you.

Play as male or female, gay or straight, with nine characters to romance, four alternate climax chapters, and over seventy achievements to unlock.

• Build a unique robot character--you choose everything from its shape to what it calls you • Instigate or prevent a robotic uprising • Teach your robots to love humanity, or disdain it • Build an artificial intelligence suitable to take control of the world's governments • Start a war against the United States, and win • Marry a human or an advanced robot, and start a family

Here's the link to the game on the Choice of Games main website, with links to purchase the game in all the other various places below the description on the main page. [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/robots/]]

** I recently made a LW post on how the typical akrasia framing misses out on a lot of the nuances.

It might be interesting for people trying to figure out how to solve problems like motivation, procrastination, etc.

Basically, my point is that solving "getting your shit together" problems requires being specific about what problem you're trying to solve. Obvious, I know, but I hadn't explicitly verbalized it as such until recently.

** In case anyone's interested:

Now that my life has settled a notch, I'm about to start a re-read of my draft of 'Extracted', re-familiarizing myself with what I've already written before I start adding the rest of the narrative. If you want to throw in your own two cents on the current draft, you can comment on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit][GDoc]].

** Almost two weeks ago I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/66pqxb/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dgkmwo1][posted here]] about how confused I was that I didn't seem to like the anime film Your Name despite it doing basically everything right. I couldn't even claim to think it's overrated since I couldn't pin down what about the story didn't satisfy me despite adoring how well-told it was. Now I think I've figured it out and the reason it took me so long. Particularly with anime, I'm used to not liking perfectly good movies that fail to emotionally resonate with me (Spirited Away) and loving flawed films that did manage to connect with me (The Boy and The Beast).

With Your Name, what happened was that the film was resonating with me, but was tugging on emotions that I still don't comprehend and didn't gain any new insight into so I felt hollow. While I have been able to fill in most of the gaps in my emotions that my autism left me with, I still don't understand romantic love. Romance is still the only genre I haven't had any interest in exploring, I have usually responded to romantic subplots with passive acceptance, and the romances I have found engaging almost always focus on what happens after people fall in love rather than the initial connection.

Then I realized I have been in two short and shallow romantic relationships in my life, both of which the other partner initiated and I ended, and that I have made no effort to begin a new relationship, despite wanting to be in one, largely out of fear and uncertainty of my feelings. As such, I think it is important that I take steps to improve this aspect of my ability to interact with my fellow humans and personally benefit from it, but I'm not sure how. My usual way of exploring my psychology is through fiction, hence my interest in this subreddit, but if even romances I like have failed to give me insight into romantic love I don't know what will.

*** Romantic love is tricky. I think TV doesn't describe it well at all, and I don't read romance novels so I can't help you out there (I'm writing one, though, but that's another story...). The things that really do capture romantic love are the threads you see on [[/r/askreddit]] from time to time, you know, the "husbands/wives of reddit, what are your romance tips?" "how did you know she was the one?", "what is your number one tip for a happy marriage" - all those sorts of things. They're /real/ and they're wonderful.

Not being on the spectrum myself, I am not sure if my experience will help you much, but it might so I may as well share it.

So, when I was younger I went through a bit of questioning my sexual and romantic orientation like I think most people probably do. I'm pretty well settled on heterosexual (or heteroflexible?) and polyamorous now, but I added and removed labels a /lot/ from the ages of about 16-20, particularly when I was about 18.

I didn't start dating until I was 18, and the first guy, who I dated for about a year (let's call him Scott), was great. He was kind and respectful and also a giant nerd, /but I didn't feel anything for him/, like, romantically. I liked being around him and kissing him and all that, but after a year I didn't feel anything romantic. We eventually broke up after growing apart over the summer but remained best friends for about a year before I [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)][split on him]] hard and kind of ruined that entire friendship.

Anyway, the reason I share that is because at the time I identified as asexual, and while I was dating Scott, I was like, "is this romantic love? It's not, surely? I'd know it if I was feeling it?" and I was /terrified/ that I was aromantic as well.

But in my case - not in everyone's - that wasn't how things ended up. I started dating my husband and three months in I fell in love, like completely and totally. It's a wonderful feeling that can't be adequately described. I've fallen in love several times since then with various people I've dated, and it's wonderful. I relish it.

But if you'd asked me when I was 18 or 19 if that would ever happen, I'd probably frown and say, "I hope so, but I don't think so". I was awkward and felt like this whole romance thing was a world beyond me, and I was just completely and utterly inexperienced. But when it happened, it took me by surprise because I was convinced I wasn't capable of it.

In terms of /how/ to /do romance/, well, that depends on your age. Also your gender. I'm happy to offer you advice if you're a heterosexual woman but I'm guessing you're not, and dating as a heterosexual man is a completely different beast.

**** I know, but I don't think I am. I don't feel like my romantic feelings has "restrictions" similar to the ones I know my sexuality has, I just lack a comprehension of them. I have felt romantic attraction to people, but I'm afraid to act on it because I don't understand it. I want to experience romantic love and I have no reason to believe that I can't. I may have even experienced it before but failed to recognize it.

If I were aromantic, I assume I would think of Your Name as another good film that didn't click with me the way it did with others, but if that were the case I think it would be easier to accept my feelings toward the film. I've felt like I was missing something from myself that I needed to appreciate stories before, but I have never felt like the missing thing should be there instead of accepting that I just didn't have it.

***** I never did understand romantic feelings myself. How do they differ from other feelings that I have for my friends and family? I have been in romantic relationships, or that's how other people would classify them. All of them evolved from friendships. Mostly feelings of enjoying spending time with the other person, caring about them and their life, wanting to know more about them. And enjoying physical contact as a subset of those. All of those I feel for friends/family with varying intensity. Am I missing some emotion that I don't feel, that makes romantic relationships different?

*** For what it's worth, I wasn't a fan of the romance in Your Name. It was best as a comedy.

Maybe it's because I'd seen 5cm/s before.

**** Not everyone liked the romance and that's fine, it has flaws, but my feelings were contradictory so I couldn't pin down whether I did or didn't like it. I've concluded that I /should've/ been invested in it since I liked literally everything about this movie in spite of the flaws, but wasn't invested due to my lacking the emotional understanding to connect with the story rather than any issue with the substance of it.

****** I've generally avoided stories that focus primarily on romance since I rarely felt satisfaction from watching them. Most of the exceptions for me have been about a couple /after/ they've already fallen in love. However, I did end up loving Yuri on Ice, so apparently I have the capacity to enjoy the kind of romance that's a bit...silly.

Your Name was just the first romance I've seen that where the couple barely spoke to each other and I didn't think that was a problem. I was absorbed in literally everything related to the romance except for the romance itself. I didn't get invested in the core emotion of the story the rest was built around and I couldn't find a reason for it so I got introspective.
