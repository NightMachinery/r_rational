** I've been reading through this for the past few hours; I'm about to start Chapter 27, but I just wanted to share this quick tidbit about my thoughts so far.

I really like the premise. I love people using science on magic, even if I don't like the LitRPG aspect as much. But there is one big thing to point out.

*This fic is not rational.*

I haven't been following the new definition discussion that's been going on, but this is clearly not rational. Multiple characters end up holding idiot balls, there are multiple deus ex machinas, and the protagonist is clearly OP to the point of me not being worried about him at all. Gods are almost cast as good/evil, being Orderly or Chaotic, and they're supposed to be personifications of their domains, but act right.

(Literal personifications of eg. Death act alien in how they think. Think AI optimized for one particular aspect or fae a la Dresden Files. These gods are supposed to be like that, yet also act like humans like Greek gods. Note: Greek/Roman gods merely control their domain; they're supposed to be very human.)

The idea of his AI is awesome, but overpowered and poorly defined; it doesn't make sense for it to be as it is, ie., it should have caused a singularity already due to its overpoweredness in his home universe. There is no antagonist that improves as rapidly as he is to be considered dangerous. Yes, there's more powerful beings, but it feels like he'll eventually surpass them.

I could continue breaking down this story's anti-rationality later if anyone wants me too. (I'm on mobile and it's late.)

Ultimately, the prose itself is pretty good. Enough so that I'm not knowledgeable enough about writing to notice any negative parts that may exist. Despite this, the quality of the characterization, the plot, and the world-building are lacking (in my opinion). They're not good enough to be declared rational.

Is this a satisfying story that I'm going to at least going to get caught up? Yes. Will I continue after that point? I don't know. It's not rational enough for me to stop being annoyed to some extent, and I don't particularly care about any character. It feels like a story where the author will eventually write themselves into a corner and be unable to finish it. Maybe they won't, but down the line, the author is probably going to have a tough time working on it regardless.

Author,\\
I like the prose, but it's not rational. This is okay, but I just have high standards. I love your ideas, but implications were not fully thought out. Again, this is okay, but not for this subreddit. Know that I'll still follow this for a little while.

I wish you luck and happy writing.

#+end_quote

I would say it's meh. Exposition is clumsy and things are explained that don't need to be. Here's a section from the start of chapter one:

#+begin_quote
  While his field of study was applied quantum physics -- a field which had appeared not too long ago, he strongly disliked pure theory and liked to “get his hands dirty”, thus, he was also an excellent mechatronics engineer and computer programmer.
#+end_quote

First, the punctuation is off: "a field which had appeared not too long ago" is an appositive clause, so it should be surrounded either by commas or emdashes, but not one of each.

Second, "show, don't tell". Instead of asserting that he's excellent at his job, just show him being excellent as the story develops. Check out Rick Cook's "Wizard Bane" for a good example of how to do that. (It's available for free from the Baen Free Library.)

Third: None of this is necessary. The scene it's contained in is him doing experiments with the quantum field, so we can figure out that he's a quantum scientist. Add in a sentence like "The robotic arm was freezing up again and he'd had to reboot it twice tonight; he made a note to check the code in the morning." Boom, we know he's a programmer.

The next paragraph:

#+begin_quote
  With help from his cerebral implants, he had managed to study multiple fields of science like so many of his peers. The implants granted one eidetic memory, and could hold hundreds of years' worth of knowledge. Many scientists naturally used them to further their research.
#+end_quote

First, modern SF&F readers don't need you to explain what cerebral implants do.

Second, "hundreds of years of knowledge" is a weird phrasing. Information is typically measured in quantities like 'petabytes', not in temporal units. (Sidebar: Also "information" and "knowledge" are subtly different, and I don't think "knowledge" is the right choice here. "Knowledge" is generally used to mean information that is stored in the human brain, and it carries implications of understanding and experience as opposed to pure facts. That's very much a subtlety, and the author's bio says that he isn't a native English speaker, so it's not a big thing.)

Finally, why is that last sentence there? Isn't it obvious that something which enhances cognition would be popular with scientists? Unless this was intended to be a bit of worldbuilding referencing the fact that these implants were so cheap and so safe that they are available to a broad swath of society. If so, I think there would have been smoother ways.

All in all, this is clearly a first novel. It's an above-average first novel in that spag is generally solid, but it's definitely a first novel.

**** Wow, this general thread made me want to give this story a read, and your comment is making me doubt a little about it. One sure thing : I found your post quite interesting, really.

Now, I didn't read the story, but from what I can pick in what you quote, about the "years worth of knowledge" make me think it's talking an average amount of time to learn a rough amount of knowledge. In other words : "without those implants, it would have taken him hundreds of years to learn everything he knows"

Also, while modern SF&F readers don't need to be explained what cerebral implants are or do, there's this possibility that author's intended target is wider in scope, or younger, or something like that that would explain the need to explain :) (maybe ?)

  years of knowledge
#+end_quote

Sure. I didn't say it was wrong -- it's not -- just that it was weird. It also opens up questions like "so, does it actually provide him with other people's knowledge, or does it simply store all of his knowledge so that he can't forget it?"

#+begin_quote
  modern readers / wider audience
#+end_quote

Perhaps. I would contend that even non-SF readers would probably know what each of the words "cerebral" and "implants" mean and could deduce the meaning of the phrase.

*** I liked the concept of someone dropped into a LitRPG with starting Scientist and Engineer classes, but at least as far as I got in, it failed to do anything with them due to The Computet In My Head cracked the magic system as the main plot.

** *Series description:*

#+begin_quote
  The Magineer is a web serial about programmable magic. A scientist/engineer from Earth's future is transported to a different world in a scientific accident.

  Caught in a war between two enemy nations, one of which is trying to enslave the other, it all comes to a choice: what will Ethan West do?

  But first, he has to answer an important question: in a world of magic, is science still relevant?

** Ugh the story Its fine I guess but I don't like how little science there is in it. like I mean the mc seems to just effortlessly discovering things all the time. well its more that the AI is the one doing the researching. when I saw the title and premise and the fact that its in this subreddit I imagined someone figuring how magic works and munchkining it . But the mc doesn't really seem actually that competent .

That doesn't mean that its necessarily bad . But its just not really the kind of thing I expected or like. Basically I was expecting something like a hero's war , but so far this is more about how op the mc is , and how he magically figures everything out and how much of an outside of context problem he is.

I guess I could still end up liking the story but so far it doen't seem interesting to me. I don't think its bad , just meh.

*** It's very light reading with an overpowered main character. This is the kind of fluff I needed to pad my month with in-between the more difficult reads this soon provides for me.

  He finally gave up and went back into his /simulated lab/. He immediately resumed his experiment.

  Today he was /modelling the new subatomic/ particles his *AI had detected* upon entering this world.

  He'd discovered 2 so far. He hadn't completely figured out their natures yet.

  The first seemed to react to spell casting, the second seemed to power it somehow.

  He was sure there were more particles to be discovered, but he had *no idea how to detect them*, short of emitting them himself.
#+end_quote

Thinking of quitting at chapter 6... so much wrong here... /The AI should be able to model those particles, if it can simulate them./ *He also can't detect particles in a simulation, if his AI can't detect it and didn't know about them.*

Sounds more like science cargo cult or techno babble. Sadly programmers forget sometimes there are physical limits you can't program away.

*** I followed the link here from the HFY post out of curiosity, and it is exactly what I expected. You're not following at all.

When he entered the world, there was some kind of magical effect (but not a spell in the typical sense) that gave him the UI and the magic translator, and that's the only time the particles were detected, as at that time, they were affecting his nervous system. The lab isn't simulating the particles accurately yet. The lab is simulating the tools to analyze the limited information gathered when he arrived so that he /can/ simulate them.

**** Well, could be I don't follow.

So, his AI detected changes in the nervous system or the particles? Can you quote that?

Also, did he "discover" 2 models of new subatomic particles? Or what did he discover? The Higgs boson (god particle) was discovered in 2012, when they measured it in CERN. Not when mathematicians made a model of the behaviour of the particle decades earlier.

** Caught up and it's surprisingly enjoyable, but I agree with the others that the implants do all the work for him and everything gets overexposed.

Additionally, I think you introduced way too many characters early on that don't actually matter, at least by the current chapter. I can see Aylin being more important later, but every other Polarii viewpoint feels like a waste of screentime.

I think you have some great ideas, and the story has been improving with time (I particularly like when we get a look at the character's thought process as he designs a spell or course of action) but yeah there are a lot of parts that need to be polished before I consider this rational.

I'd highly recommend rewriting the fluff out when you get the time, and maybe making the implant worthless as anything other than raw processing power, because right now it really is too powerful. He's already got endless buffs from his class abilities and a bunch of blessings from the gods, he really doesn't need more help. Not even just that, the parts that the implants skip are the parts I would find enjoyable to read.
