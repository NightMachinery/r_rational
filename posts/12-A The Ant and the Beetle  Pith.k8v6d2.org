** That arc title is super promising.

I really like that we're seeing all of this brutality by Commonplace (especially the nudged and maimed servants being sent on suicide missions) right after the Maxine Clive interlude. It's a wonderful juxtaposition, considering how much it evokes Maxine's own experiences at Buttercup Lodge. It serves to highlight the brutality of both sides, the fact that no one's hands are clean and that regardless of who's right or wrong, revolution is /ugly/. I especially like how Tunnel Vision's general emotionlessness reads here. While it's long been one of the most striking aspects of her character, it comes across a little differently when she's dispassionately torturing people and the sheer apathy of the "staff" at Buttercup Lodge is fresh in my mind.

None of this is an attempt to "both sides" Commonplace and Paragon, by the way, since I'm still firmly of the belief that Paragon is the worse of the two and that Commonplace winning would be a good thing in the grand scheme of things. While the juxtaposition of this chapter and Buttercup Lodge highlight the similarities in the /level/ of brutality between the two sides, the /nature/ of the atrocities has some key differences. Most notably, Commonplace is committing war crimes with reckless abandon, whereas Paragon built and operated Buttercup Lodge in a time of peace.

** Great chapter! The pace of the fight scenes was relentless, yet they were easy to follow, and it was always clear where the protagonists were going and why.

A little odd that after her "should have nabbed a green hand's body while I had a chance" moment Ana isn't even considering it now, but I guess even if she did she wouldn't stomach it.

Also, holy crap, Ana is /still/ completely willing to work for Paragon, even though she's seeing proof after proof of their corruption? What's it going to take, giant flaming letters?

Though with a title like that, I guess we'll find out before the end of this arc.

** I'm still ducking reeling after that Maxine interlude. What the ludicrous fuck is going on the broader world here?

*** Commonplace gave Paragon false intel that they were going to invade the Agricultural Islands, a strategic region. As a result, most of the military and high-level Guardians have left the city.

Commonplace used the opportunity to assault Paragon Academy (plus a few military bases).

They used their infiltrator (the one who got swapped with miss "beat up with baseball bats" a few interludes ago) to break in the school's chassis vault, and act as a kind of telephone line to transfer souls through, to give them an army on the inside.

Commonplace is currently in the middle of slaughtering Paragon students. Also, the members of parliament who were supposed to be here are mysteriously missing, and the Pyre Witch is trying to bait out the remaining Guardians, who are hanging back for some reason (probably defending something?).

**** Gotcha, I meant more with the spoooky black water and oracle snakes and the creepy inmate that freed Maxine. Plus, that whole bit about “you called up something you cannot put down”.

** One thing I find interesting is that Ana blames Hira for not being there, but gives Jun a pass for not being violent, even though he could have easily have done the thing they needed . I find the dissonance interesting, and I think it's a sign of how much she misses Hira.
