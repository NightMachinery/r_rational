You're running a hospital somewhere in the Untied States during the Cheney administration. You have valuable scrollwheels of the Purifying Name. You need to be able to access them easily for use on patients with proper insurance, but they're very expensive and you can't afford for a thief to get them. What's worse: you've been warned that the UUs are trying to lay hands on a scrollwheel, and might be able to crack the Klipah if they do. If a valuable Name goes free thanks to your lax security, you'll be on all the theonomics companies' bad lists for years.

At the same time, you are struggling financially and can't afford to throw a fortune at this (or anything else). It's possible that somebody's getting rich off of medicine, but it's not you.

How do you keep the Name secure?


** This is based off my personal experience with medical facilities and interest in physical/social security. I've done my best to keep it realistic to modern hospitals, and take into account patient needs and OSHA requirements. TL;DR: Repurpose an old radiology department for its physical resilience and architectural characteristics, use the area of effect nature of the purifying name to allow for a physical barrier between patient and tech with the scroll wheel, use 3 factor authentication for the scroll tech, transport tech, and patient to keep the scroll locked up except during confirmed administration, set the whole thing to alarm if there are bad actors or a medical emergency, practice good patient information security and site security.

Intellectual / Employee Security: Start with the obvious: Don't teach the name to anyone. Teaching employees the name and having them sign an NDA and do-not-compete is insufficient. Only run the name off scroll wheels, keep the scroll wheel location need to know.

Operational Security: Do you bring the wheel to the patient or the patient to the wheel? Security to get to patients in most hospitals is actually quite lax, and assuming I'm using a modern hospital design, with open doors during the day and maybe an emergency-only entrance with security guards and metal detector at night, the risk of something happening to the wheel, or more likely an employee dropping/breaking/losing the wheel in transit is too high. You have to take the patient to the wheel, or well secured location. You can transport even incredibly unstable patients to hour-long MRI's while attached to multiple forms of life support, if they're sicker than that then curing an infection with the wheel isn't going to be enough to save them anyway. The tech for the day enters the facility, is verified with ID badge, personal code/password, and fingerprint, goes to the scroll-tech-only part of the hospital, where there's a restroom, computer, lunch room, and call room, and has to verify identity again to go to the area where the scroll wheel actually is.

Administration Site Security: Here I'm reading the purifying name literally from the UNSONG RPG book and it says it "cleanses and area". This makes things easier. This whole section is me repurposing already existing hospital architecture: Repurpose an old radiology room, either an MRI or an old linear accelerator room. They're typically already underground, have multiple checkpoints and shielding, and have a divider between the patient and the technician. On one side, have the technician with the scroll wheel, on the other side, a marked area where the patient needs to be for the scroll to work. Have the administration room require an employee ID badge, a transport tech fingerprint, passcode, and a patient ID bracelet to be scanned for entry to the administration/patient area. For patient safety, you probably need a one-way door so the scroll tech can access the patient area. That door only opens back to the scroll administration area with a scroll tech badge, code, and fingerprint.

Storage Security: Scroll wheel is kept in a room that is only opened by a combination of: tech ID, tech fingerprint, and confirmation of scanned patient ID bracelet (checked against a list of patients who are pre-approved). Once last standard checklist occurs prior to the vault room being unlocked, which includes verification of patient DoB or SSN or personal passcode, and visual verification of patient identity against medical record picture of them by transport. Vault opens, scroll wheel comes out, tech takes it to the admin area, and returns it after using. You could have the one-way door above and the exit to the tech-only area be locked while the scroll wheel is out, but I'm pretty sure that's an OSHA violation, so just alarm them instead to call hospital security and rapid medical response, since that's the only reason the tech should ever open that door with the wheel out.

Informational Security: I'm serving an exclusive clientele with the Name, so I don't need to disclose the location of the place where the scroll is administered to anyone other than the techs, who have their own route there, the patients, who paid to be on a list of approved users and have some legal or financial consequences for giving the info up, and the tech who transports the patients to the name area. You can easily require the elevator to get to the old abandoned radiology department be an employee only elevator. If you were particularly paranoid you could have 3 walls of the administration area have a door and one-way mirror and only one actually have the tech and scroll behind it, but that seems like a waste of money for an edge case where terrorists gets this close to the scroll and then blow open a wall.

What does this protect against: You now need 3 factor authentication times 3 (2 techs and a patient) to get the scroll to unlock, plus confirmation in the record that an MD or more likely a committee approved scroll administration for this patient. Impersonating a scroll tech or a transport tech or a patient isn't sufficient, and even a tech who was turned against my hospital would still need the right situation to get access to the scroll, and leaving with it not in the right place would set off alarms. Your administration room is underground, shielded, and in a secret location, so an earthquake or other natural (or Name caused) disaster would keep it safe.

What doesn't this protect against: The one-way access and barrier between the scroll tech area and the patient/transport tech area is your weak point. One bad actor at that point of any of the three could steal the scroll, but it would set off alarms. A turned scroll tech (or someone with their face, badge, access code, and fingerprints, but I don't think that level of impersonation is common even in Unsong) could wait until an approved patient came down and just leave via the one-way door once the scroll unlocked, but they'd still need to deal with security. A patient could pay their way onto the list, infect themselves, get approval for treatment, and then take the transport tech hostage or fake a medical emergency, which would still have to deal with security. Same thing for someone impersonating a transport tech. A terrorist or social engineer could also piggyback off the process (follow the transport/patient, use their information) if they learned of a name administration that was happening (we do our best with patient information info-sec but you can only do so much), but they could only get into the patient/transport tech area of the namology department, at which point the name is still locked away and inaccessible without the authentication process, and attempts at threats or hostage taking would probably be met with a silent alarm (button located in tech area, also likely already present prior to renovations). Your players or other bad actors could also have a plant on the security team or rapid response team, and set off the alarm on purpose, but those employees would also have 3FA to get their gear every day, and would have a background check and interview to get hired.

*** Good stuff, but I think it would be simpler use the MRI's anti-theft mechanism. Convert the scroll wheel into a multi tonne, room-sized contraption and install it in a secure, central location. All you'd really need is a unique, closed system to distribute the name; with a lot of bulk and useless junk added on to confuse potential thieves. Or you could keep the scroll wheel in one piece, and embed it in a car-sized hunk of reinforced concrete.

There was some bombing case that I can only half remember where the perpetrator did something similar, just tonnes of wires and so much extra junk added on top of the bomb that the FBI couldn't determine what if anything was necessary to the system... IIRC it was not detonated and there were no fatalities. If anyone can remember more details, let me know, this gap in knowledge is bothering me.

I read UNSONG a few years ago now, so I may not be remembering enough for this thought to be valid.

**** You're totally right. I remember the Motive Name was used to drive cars in Unsong, so it must be possible to operate scroll wheels remotely or at least while they're not visible.

Keep the 3 factor authentication X 3 (tech, transport, patient) for people to even get into range of the scroll, but have it be sealed in concrete/metal that leaves just enough area to fit one patient (have your department be the lowest basement level (typical for radiation oncology centers) with the name buried underneath. Assuming it works in a sphere you could have a small stretcher / bed directly over the edge of the names effective area. Then potential thieves would need to learn the location and timing of a treatment, piggy back off that using social engineering to actually get in the same room as the scroll, and then still would need to extract the scroll without bringing the building down on top of them, plus there would be at least two employees in the same area who could sound the alarm.

**** I believe for the FBI Bomb thing you are referring to is the Harvey's Resort Bomb (which did in fact detonate, but with no injuries). I have a coworker who was a former EOD tech (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) and that bomb is apparently the gold standard for "hard to defuse" for anything made by a single individual or small group (anything less than a nation-state).

***** That's closer than anything I've found, but it doesn't seem to have enough useless shit attached to it.

I'm starting to think that I'm misremembering a movie or TV show's plot rather than something that happened.

I appreciate the guess though!

****** There was an article I read a few years ago ... I couldn't find Wikipedia did offer this .... [[https://hackaday.com/2015/09/21/this-is-what-a-real-bomb-looks-like/]]

" The only visible user interface was 28 toggle switches arranged in 5 neat rows ... *no less than 8 independent trigger systems,* each capable of causing an explosion ... " (although I guess that isn't "useless shit" just "multiple redundancy...")

*** That's the idea. I wrote a [[https://dspeyer.github.io/unsongrpg.html][system]] for it ages ago, and I want to give it a proper playtest. I have barely any DMing experience and I kept getting stuck on this aspect of the challenge building.

**** very cool! hope it goes well.

I've recently been playing Blades in the Dark, which has some really nice aspects that could potentially port well. It's highly narratively based vs the more detailed mechanics of D&D, and one thing I like is that enemies don't make rolls for the most part. there's just sucesss or failure on the PC rolls, and when they fail it comes with a Consequence of the GM's choosing. This is great because you don't have to plan everything out in advance and tune the challenge level - the PCs just make a plan, roll to execute actions, and when there is a fail or partial success narratively appropriate wrenches get thrown in the system. It's very fluid and gets everyone involved in the storytelling rather than the minutia.

** Not going to be able to compete with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/mu7ys5/how_would_you_defend_a_hospital_in_the_unsong/gv4qcb0/][this]] but I think Klipah enables double-blinded placebo administration of the holy names of God, which could both help your less fortunate patients (in the Unsong-verse, I imagine the placebo effect is really strong for multiple reasons) and enable some extra security. Have an opaque computer algorithm responsible for determining the level of care a patient gets and outputting the ID of a scroll. It usually outputs the ID of a decoy scroll. Each scroll is locked in a separate locker. For bonus points, some lockers don't have scrolls, just exploding ink packs, and the computer never outputs those IDs.

** So I agree with [[/u/aponty][u/aponty]]'s answer... but to elaborate on it, merely allowing the scrollwheel to get stolen doesn't properly fix the system, you want someone who can reverse engineer the name (or at least the scrollwheel) and redistribute it freely in a fashion that undermines that capitalist system that monopolizes and maximizes shareholder profit while pretending this is justified under the motivation of funding research into new names.

So along those lines... I would set up extensive but intentionally faulty and inexpensive security theater around the scrollwheel that is actually designed to allow a Kabbalist disguised as a security specialist that is secretly a singer unlimited access to the scroll wheel. My hospital will probably suffer badly if theonomic's companies blame me when the name (not just the individual scroll wheel) gets reverse engineered.... but if my "security consultant" is clever enough they could steal the name off the scroll wheel while leaving the wheel intact, then anonymously redistribute the name, (pretending to have simply independently invented it).

The theonomic's company that "owns" the name would lose out on some profits but a lot of official usages would still need the official version so they would have enough funding to keep chugging along. A lot of the free usages the theonomic's company wouldn't have licensed in the first place because they wouldn't be able to price discriminate and extract value out of them, so they wouldn't really be losing money.

On a related note... I think the whole thing about the theonomic's company methods and attitudes illustrate just how close while yet so far Scott is from properly grasping leftist thought. Like he sets up the theonomic's companies as clearly bad in the sense that they are maintaining and supporting an unjust and outright inefficient system... but then he tears down this point by making the radical leftist a ridiculously bad strawman and the theonomic's company CEO an alright guy that is really in it for the greater good, so you know, the theonomic companies aren't actually that bad. In the process missing the implicit point of his own world building that the capitalist system that propagates the exploitation of the names for profit is bad and inefficient no matter how many nice, smiling, well meaning CEOs he writes and idiotic Dylan Alvarez types oppose it.

*Edit*: I missed the context of a Roleplay... with that context in mind, it would certainly make for a sadistic/ironic twist to reveal that the Hospital Administration had already leaked the name prior to the players trying to steal the scroll... I don't know if the tone of your campaign is right for your players to find that ironically funny as opposed to just trolling. If they confront the singer Kabbalist secretly reverse engineering the scroll posing as a security guard it could make for an interesting boss fight with the option for the players to diplomacy their way out of it if they guess the situation of recognize some Unitarian Universalist shibboleth because they paid careful attention to the lore.

*** Yeah, but if you're going that route, what you need to do is shift the liability, which you can accomplish in two parts.

The first is to put out a blog post, or press release, or open letter, or some other publicly available text, where every seventh letter is ciphertext for a character on the scroll wheel, using a simple substitution cipher. The beauty of this method is that the scroll wheel is *already* encoded with a substitution cipher which the UUs are trying to decode; using another substitution cipher obscures the connection to the scroll wheel but does not add any difficulty to the decryption process. Unless someone knows exactly where to look, it'll be effectively impossible to find (and if the people tracking down the leak do know where to look, your secret is probably blown anyway).

The second step is to sow misdirection. Start a rumour that there will be an attempted theft at [other facility with the scroll wheels], and then substantiate it just enough that, when the time period of the "theft" comes and goes without incident, everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

They'll never be able to substantiate that the leak came from the other facility (because it didn't), so it shouldn't cause any harm, but it should also prevent you from being considered the most likely source of the leak.
