Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Monday Bigpost Time!

Standard disclaimer: not all of these are necessarily rational, they're just stories that were good enough for me to stomach catching up to them. Most of these are wormfics, because I'm a shameless addict, but some of them aren't.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/ashen-fe3h-quest.57644/][Ashen (FE:3H Quest)]] is a pretty great Fire Emblem: Three Houses quest. I was put off by this at first, because it doesn't follow canon, but I really can't fault it for being original. It's one of the most in-depth, quests I've seen in a while, and it has some of my favorite critical successes of all time.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21894865/chapters/52259905][Those Who Soar into Dawn]] is the intelligent FE:3H story I was expecting from /Ashen/ at first. This is the most explicitly rational thing here, but I don't know if the author has posted it to the subreddit yet. It's not the rational Fire Emblem I would write, but it's close enough that I'm recommending it with the same kind of investment with which I would recommend my own work.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/][My Hero School Adventure is All Wrong, As Expected]] took a bit of effort to start reading. The first chapter has the mandatory edgy Hachiman essay, but once you get over that hump, you're greeted with one of the better Oregairu stories. I really like how seamless the crossover is, and while Hachiman's distorted perspective isn't quite as realistic as the one in the original, it's very much entertaining.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/epeius-mass-effect-au.816218/][Epeius]] (formerly: First Contact) is a generic Mass Effect fic that's distinguished by update speed and common sense. The author has been maintaining a chapter a day for the last two months. The story is not ground breaking, and it's a bit tedious, but it still manages to stay true to the vision of a more intelligent version of Mass Effect canon.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/would-that-i-were-born-no-princess-youjo-senki-final-fantasy-tactics-wotl.805228/][Would that I were born no princess...]] is one of the many Tanya fics that spawned in the wake of [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]]. It's not quite as fun, but I think the setting of FFT is cool enough to make up for that. I'm mostly invested for the hype of what's coming up soon, but what's there isn't bad.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-kaleid-liner-prisma-taylor-wormxnasu-magical-girl-taylor.478918/][Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Taylor]] is significantly less terrifying than the show it is based on. Taylor is stupidly powerful, the characters are fun, but it's not really saying anything significant or doing anything clever. Read it for the vague Fate/ cross. Not my least favorite, but close. You could swap it for /Oobleck/ and I'd be hard pressed to debate the change.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/on-fluttering-wings-taylor-hebert-in-mgln.53204/][On Fluttering Wings]] resurrected last December, and I finally read it. Heartfelt magical bullshit in the Nanoha universe. Notable for being one of the few pre-canon stories with Taylor sent to another universe. I really wish it were longer than it is, but what is there looks promising. I would say that it's finished it's first arc and moved on to its second, even if it's not spelled out in traditional Worm fashion.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-adventures-of-oobleck.48996/][The Adventures of Oobleck!!!]] is a sekirei crossover with RWBY (huh?). For a Sekirei cross, it's pretty generic, and there are a bunch of others I would recommend more, but for where it is now I think it's criminally underrated. Pretty decent RomCom bullshit.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825430/1/Of-Elder-Scrolls-and-Huntsmen-Dragon-Rose][Of Elder Scrolls and Huntsmen]] somehow this fell in between my older posts and I forgot about it. I'm not that much of a RWBY fan, I swear. They just stuck out more this month. I like this one for having probably the most complete take on the world of /Skyrim/ of all of the stories I've ever read. There are some that go into more depth, but none that quite capture the blend of noob-friendly and interesting that this one does. It also gets points for people acting like people and taking reasonable steps to maintain relationships/curtail drama.

There are also a couple of honorable mentions.

- If you're looking for more RWBY, you might be okay with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]]. Don't let the /very large/ AU turn you away - not that it's a flawless story - it's that I like it because it lives and dies on its own merits. If you don't like RWBY, you might enjoy this. If you're not a fan of Coeur Al'Aran and his distinctive style of Jaunefic, you know immediately that you won't enjoy it. Simple and easy to recommend. It has clever moments and stupid moments on par with the average piece of original fiction.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/its-not-wrong-to-make-friends-in-the-dungeon-danmachi-sanctioned-worm.59498/][It's Not Wrong to Make Friends in a Dungeon]] is a fun crack story crossover between Danmachi and Worm. I think that it has the same problem a lot of stories by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/ravensdagger.17283/][RavensDagger]] do, where the crack starts to bleed into the genuine emotional moments of the fic. There also isn't much conflict, at all, which is funny given the premise. I dropped it, but there's a chance you'll like it more than I did.

- Speaking of Danmachi, I also read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/heroic-myth-fate-grand-order-x-danmachi.729157/][Heroic Myth]], a crossover between that and Fate. SPAG could be much better, plot is kind of all over the place, but if you're a fan of Fate Stay Night it might be your thing. That's all I can say about it. I guess I wish the heroes were more familiar to me? Also, the cast grows a little too large for some of the scenes to handle.

(Tentative) Ranked List:

1.  On Fluttering Wings
2.  Of Elder Scrolls and Huntsmen (because of length and consistency, mostly)
3.  Ashen
4.  Those Who Soar into Dawn (/will/ move up when it gets longer, has first place potential)
5.  Hero School Adventure
6.  Were that I were born no princess...
7.  The Adventures of Oobleck
8.  Kaleid Liner Prisma Taylor
9.  Epeius
10. Honorable Mentions (in the order I mentioned them)

*** Also, re: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]]: it's started updating again yay.

The author also recommended [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-delinquency-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.788149/][A Young Woman's Delinquency Record]], which is very good IMO. It's kind of a capitalist horror story about what would happen if Tanya ever managed to escape the war. It's kinda like that theoretical problem with time travel: modern business plans are super efficient, so Tanya basically just goes around the world destabilizing everything with advanced HR practices.

I don't know how rational it is, because like all Tanya stories it tends to rely quite a lot on contrived coincidences ruining Tanya's short-term plans. It's still great though.

** I've seen Dungeon Keeper Ami recommended for a long time on this sub. I finally got around to reading it, and it was....ok (as far as it's written so far, it's not yet completed). For the most part, the MC and her minions are pretty well written and work well. The plot is interesting and the story does a good job of maintaining pace and urgency. But basically the entire non-main cast is a masterclass in carrying the idiot ball. Time and time again people make decisions and judgements that are clearly bad and misinformed solely for the sake of the plot. This primarily plays out in people refusing to believe that Ami is not evil, or at least not particularly evil. Now, it would absolutely be reasonable for a few, or some subset of characters to be completely prejudiced by her status as a Keeper and refuse to believe any evidence to the contrary. That is a thing that happens in real life with real people. But for ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE to do so strains credulity and breaks my immersion in the story. These are not believable actions by believable characters. The only cases where people don't believe this are basically cases of divine intervention where Light gods straight up tell people "she's not that bad". Which happens twice. Even though the Light gods are shown to be willing to talk to basically any priest while they are in a church.

All in all, it's a decent story that has pretty good writing but it fails miserably at meeting the standards of rational fiction (it doesn't try to be rationalist, but that's perfectly fine). I haven't read much of the wider world of dungeon core fiction, so maybe it's a really good example of the genre, but if so that should be viewed as an indictment of the state of the category rather than praise of Dungeon Keeper Ami.

They may say "she's not that bad", and the Avatar may say "just leave her alone and she won't bother you", but they don't say that she's /good/.

**** Spoilers below

Absolutely, but the mental contortions that every character goes through to fit their notion is ridiculous. The writing /explicitly shows/ characters being confused by her actions/behavior and positing the most ridiculous ideas to explain it while keeping her evil. One of the more egregious examples is the Fairies (and other characters) treating the temporary eye fix as an "evil action". They ALL know that she is not the one who actually damaged their eyes. So even if they thought that she was keeping the civilians alive for nefarious purposes, fixing their eyes is /obviously/ not an inherently evil action, even if they believe it's long term goal to be evil. It would be one thing if they didn't trust her and were convinced that she was going to sacrifice them all or something eventually, but continually acting as if fixing their eyes /in and of itself/ was an evil action is pure idiot-ball carrying.

It's the equivalent of me looking at a political prisoner in some authoritarian dictatorship and saying "Well they are keeping this prisoner in the jail for evil reasons, and therefore the fact they they stitched up his injuries is also evil".

And, again, if it wasn't every single character doing it, it would be a bit more believable, It is the universality that makes it problematic (to me).

-edit- Also, given that they want her to give up and seek sanctuary with the Light, triggering a black crusade against her that she knows she can't win seems like a pretty good outcome from the Light's perspective. (Also....when at least 1, maybe 2 different dark gods /already/ hate her....how far from a Dark Crusade is she really?

***** I personally view it not as an idiot ball, but different mentality. This is a world where good and evil are tangible, objective things, steming from following the Light and Dark gods respectively, and Keepers are thoroughly evil. It's a /fact/, a rule that has never been broken until now. It takes personal contact to see beyond that.

Also, the last time anyone believed that a Keeper may not be that bad it resulted in a dwarf civil war.

***** The real world equivalent to the eyes issue would be more like this:

A group of your citizens were kidnapped, and maimed by a terrorist group. An authoritarian regime subsequently killed that group, for their own benefit, and seized those citizens. They have treated your citizens, but claim that if those citizens leave their custody that treatment will reverse, not by their choice of course.

You can't send anyone to verify due to the risk of your doctor's and soldiers being kidnapped and tortured into servitude, as the regime is known to do.

*** Just finished the last installment of Dungeon Keeper Ami and I share your frustration. For me, it's the case of characters that cannot learn. Ami never accept that "evilness of a Keeper" as a dogma. Time and time again, she tried to show that she's an exception. It's very wasteful. A teenage rational character will not try to fight that deep rooted stereotype the third time around (second time around for adult). Instead, they'll work around it. In case of badasses, they'll integrate them into their strategy. Maybe by acting haughty, or frame her action in sinister rhetoric. That's what I want to see from fiction repeatedly mentioned here. Not this shame excuse of character. Actually, when she casted Marda fighting Vampire as punishment I dared to hope the fiction turn good. But alas, that's one time occurrence. She's stays shitty until the end.

Nice worldbuilding though.

But again, full score of worldbuilding (which this fiction did not attain) cannot make a work pleasurable to read if the characters score dip into the negative.

In the spirit of Recommendation thread, I'd recommend its counter example [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4]]. The main character knows exactly how to fit in in his stupid world. Bad worldbuilding and low writing skill hamper my reading enjoyment only a little. Counter recommend Wandering Inn. That one and Dungeon Keeper Ami are just the same.

The MC is a character from one LN (about solving other's social problems) who finds himself in the world of another LN (About guilds led by Gods adventuring in dungeons). Our MC is very familiar with LN tropes and has a real munchkin positive attitude.

From memory I feel that the story jumps the shark in last couple arcs but besides that the story is an engaging look into how someone familiar with modern RPG mechanics and narrative tropes might exploit them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11221623][The Calculator]]

This story doesn't fully match your requirements. It's less about one person making their way through the system than it is about them simply survivng for the moment.

MC here is someone with DC knowledge who has ended up in some DC universe and uses their meta-knowledge and smarts/metahuman-skill to survive in the face of some pretty dire situations.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]]

Here's another one that doesn't quite match your requirements. One of our MC's is a young Tom Riddle and the other is the SI as a voice in his head. Our MC's go pretty hard in trying to find creative ways to grow in power and get the most they can out of hogwarts.

** I'd like to recommend a series of fanfic by Kantuur-Set, starting [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-past-but-no-future-a-kancolle-si-completed.661305/][here]].

The first one is a KanColle fanfic in which an SI character with no knowledge of the setting is reincarnated as the USS Salt Lake City's embodiment as one of many ship-girl hybrid in the middle of a war against evil, similar hybrids. She decides that she would rather stay off the radar for fear of conscription, and character drama proceeds from there.

It's a shortish (~30k words) fic with themes of transhumanism and actual serious mistakes made by the protagonist, and I highly recommend it.

The second in the series is about the embodiment of the battleship Yamato dealing with feeling useless due to excessive logistical costs for her deployment, and is a strong sequel.

The third is lighter in tone and set in the same universe, and finally the fourth is about a battleship who appears spontaneously after the war has been won with no enemies left to fight. These two were weaker, IMO, but still worth reading after loving the first two.

Overall, the biggest selling points for the whole set of four is that the author knows how to keep things concise and contained- each story ends at a good point without feeling the need to expand in unplanned ways past what would be effective.

** Looking for novels/fics with teacher protagonist.

Since fantasy novels tend to focus on a growing protagonist, they usually have MC in the position of a student. Protagonist being a teacher is a big rarity, and I have yet to find one that would also qualify as rational.

And even among novels that do go this path, not many focus on actual teaching, the protagoist's work to see his students growth, instead going on solo adventures somewhere.

Can you make some suggestions please?

*** Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4 is an example of this I've been enjoying lately. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4]]

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/yes-professor-hp-si.55067/]] Hasn't updated in a bit but I remember enjoying it and I don't think it's dead.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/]] is an example of this. It has a very strong start, but ymmv on some of the later developments.

I'll also reccomend both the novels and the anime for El Melloi Case files, but that presupposes you have some prior knowledge of the nasuverse.

Very amusing (I read it too), but the enjoyment is rather undermined by the protagonist having /so much resourses/ (both system-bound and not) it stops being funny.

I'll try, ty. Not much text there yet though, and half a year break between two last chapters is not encouraging.

I reread it so many times, never fails to crack me up. But only up until the hiatus Sage of Eyes took in 2016. Later chapters... well, let's not even talk about them. Even Sage said the book's finale was not the best work.

** Xianxia has been a hot topic on these threads this month. If anyone wants to get into Xianxia but stays away because of the one dimensional characters and bad english translations, I wholeheartedly recommend the manhua [[https://mangadex.org/chapter/723599/1][Heresy]] to change your mind. It has everything that defines a Xianxia. Power scaling, sects, hidden experts, arrogant nobles, and more. I really love this manhua because it shows the realistic divide between mortals and cultivators. The translation is well written and the artwork is exceptional.

I'm also loving arrogant young master on royalroad. If anyone has any xianxia recs that breaks the common mold I would be greatful.

*** Ze Tian Ji is one that I'd say definitely breaks the mold. A lot of people love it or hate it because of how different it is from most cultivation novels, but personally I loved it. Overall it is much more of a political story that happens to have cultivation than a pure cultivation story, with physical power being less important than the other intangible ideas of power. If you are looking for a pure Xianxia story I wouldn't say its a great fit, but otherwise definitely check it out.

*** I'm really impressed with heresy. Thank you for the rec. I love the little details, like how sect members walk around with their badges in interesting places, and all carry magic bags and tools.

​

The aesthetics are out of this world, definitely a more primal and ancient looking chinese setting. Really impressive, it's much cooler imho than the pretty silk robes and everything being clean and pristine. This has much more of an old, grounded feel to it, everything feels like it was made and is used.

​

The robe with the talismans in layers as protection, look so cool, that's how you make cool cultivation armor. Much better than what you generally get, and it can even be used as a way to show durability decreasing by burning talismans out as it gets damaged.

​

On the last chapter you can also see a villain pulling some very interesting and elaborated munchink. Very cool indeed. Instantly on the top 10 cultivation stories.

** i am pretty late to the thread

but i would like to recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard][The Confessions of the Magpie Wizard]]

#+begin_quote
  In a dark future, the demonic Grim Horde rules most of the Earth, and Britain has just fallen. The last survivor of the island is the young wizard Soren Marlowe, the newest student at the Nagoya Academy of Magic. To all appearances, he is a normal enough young man, if a little girl crazy.

  Little do they know that he's an exiled devil, one of the very same demons who helped destroy the fallen island! Now thrust into the middle of someone else's romantic comedy, Soren will need to think fast to keep his secret and, just maybe, find a little romance.
#+end_quote

the novels adhears to the anime magical academy tropes but they are written competently enough that i didnt have a problem with them here(and i do have a problem with them in most harem light novels and anime, you know the ones)

but if thats something you dont like then this might not be the novel for you. I wanted to recommend it here because i think it deserves more attention cuz its kinda nice which is rare on RR. Its not particularly rational tho,

** I don't know if anyone has read it, but a couple years ago the Atlantic published a fascinating literary deconstruction of one of the most polarizing Star Trek episodes.

[[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/star-trek-tng-and-the-limits-of-language-shaka-when-the-walls-fell/372107/]]

The author's thesis is basically that in Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, the Tamarians aren't really communicating with myths. Myths are basically function calls for various stratagems, and the story is less important than the strategy it calls. The most interesting part with me was the contrast between the verbose Trek technobabble and the Tamarian independent action of subordinates. It's an interesting argument for one of the more interesting episodes of Trek.

*** It doesn't address the fundamental problem of how they tell each other to "pass the 3/4 wrench" though, or any other specific instruction - it just papers over it by claiming they don't need to do that:

#+begin_quote
  While I suppose the explicit directive to adjust thermal input by a specified amount might be rendered allegorically (some Tamarian speech is narrower than others), it's equally likely that the entire exchange would be unnecessary, subsumed into some larger operation, say, “Baby Jessica, in her well.” The rest is just details.

We can't just dismiss the problem as "the rest is just details", the details are the problem!

**** But are they? It strikes me somewhat like the moties in Mote in God's Eye. If they do have fairly accurate abstraction capabilities, they could have a fairly accurate model of the captain and the ship's organization in their head. In that case, most communication is unnecessary, only executive level strategic functioning. They don't need to say pass the 3/4s wrench because they've brought it with them.

I admit it's a stretch, but it strikes me that superintelligences communicating could use incredibly dense messages expecting that they're decoded with linguistic and computational decompression.

***** I think claiming they're superintelligences is a stretch, yes - they clearly aren't. But even if we ignore the episode and just consider hypothetical superintelligences, either they restrict themselves to problems so simple for them they don't need to discuss the details, or they'll need to communicate about fiddly details on superintelligence-tier complex problems, and allegories aren't going to cut it.

***** So instead of getting the wrench you need the first time, you get a wrench that's too small and now tell them to pick a random larger wrench? Sure you could technically eventually get the correct wrench selected, but you aren't actually communicating the information you need - you're making a broad statement and they're guessing at the specific answer, and probably getting it wrong.
