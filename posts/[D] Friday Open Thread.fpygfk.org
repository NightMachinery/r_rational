Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** My boyfriend finally flew back to France today ("finally", I say, though it's two days earlier than originally planned back in December when he was coming to visit on a holiday...). It's very strange how much things changed in the month since he got here, apocalypse-wise.

Here's what happened with his flights:

- His first flight has the second leg cancelled after Europe closed its borders, but his flight to the hub remained

- He phones the French embassy about what his options are going to be with Europe closing down and everything and they basically tell him to buy a commercial flight, but if that all falls through they'll repatriate him

- He bought a second flight, transiting via Bangkok, last Sunday (as originally planned: we didn't want him to buy another flight straight away and have that cancelled, too).

- When he bought the flight the airline had a vague note about needing doctor's clearance to fly (even for transiting passengers). 24 hours later, "doctor's clearance" (which I assumed was a letter saying "this person has no symptoms and is not at high risk for contracting COVID-19") became a doctor stating that the patient has "no chance" of being infected */AND/* a negative test result.

- My province tests, but they're limited in number, and to qualify you need to, at the very least, be sick. They're not going to test a foreign national with no symptoms and no exposure.

- He phones the airline to get things straight, but they have a policy of hanging up on you if you hold more than 15 minutes (wtf) and the robo voice estimated he had 140 minutes to wait.

- He emails the airline, basically saying "can you tell me how I can possibly get on your flight or refund me thanks". No reply.

- He phones the Thai embassy and they say "yeah we have no idea why Thai airways is requiring a test result, we just require a doctor's note"

- There's almost no more flights back to Europe for less than two month's wage, except for ones that use four different budget carriers and so are high risk of being cancelled since if one leg is fucked you're shit out of luck

- His embassy sends out a form for people interested in repatriation, he fills it out, joking that maybe he can save the price of the return flight if they have to repatriate him

- Did I mention that he's still on probation at his job, so if he doesn't make it back within ~a week, he stands a very good chance of getting fired?

- His flight to Bangkok is cancelled, but the flight from Bangkok to Europe isn't (will he get a refund? who knows!)

- He's considering an Emirates flight but it has two stops instead of one, and one of the stops is going in the opposite direction and then doubling back, which for a journey that's 21 hours at the best of times is kind of depressing.

- Emirates cancels all their flights before he buys it, rendering this moot

- He buys a ticket transiting via Qatar for an elevated but not extortionate price (the one way ticket is the price of a two way ticket when there's no plague). This flight hadn't been visible for the past week he'd been searching.

- I'm terrified this flight is going to be cancelled to but hopeful after checking out Qatar Air's twitter they basically are saying that they are committed to staying open to repatriate people (Qatar, the country, will let just anyone transit through the airport, it's only entry that is strict) and have put larger planes on some of their routes to open more seats (which is why the flight suddenly appeared in the search again!)

- Anyway, last night I dropped him off at the airport. A normally somewhat busy (one flight every 15-30 minutes) international airport was virtually deserted. The departures board had every flight but his listed in big red "CANCELLED". It was very post-apocalyptic with social distancing enforced. Everyone boarding the flight seemed to be Europeans, no doubt repatriating themselves

- He's currently in the air and hopefully everything will work out, but at least at this point he's far enough from me that wherever in the world he ends up, he's officially his embassy's problem rather than mine ;)

- I was originally planning to go back to see him in July but now I'm hoping that things will be normal enough by December.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy that saga. It was horrible and extremely stressful to live it.

Throughout the whole thing we were wondering what would happen if he was stranded - would the embassy expect him to spend 2-3 months pay on a flight or would they repatriate him? What if he got sick and needed a hospital, would they triage him after citizens? What if he lost his job, would he be able to get chomage without presenting at the office? Would there be a problem with his apartment?

Ugh. He's landed in Qatar now and should be home within 12 hours, at which point I can hopefully calm down and just worry about him being in one of the European covid hotspots like a normal long distance girlfriend :)

** How do you write flawed characters? When I write, I have a character's whole personality in my head, which I use to model their reactions---but there are no flaws and virtues, only one large, interconnected system driven towards a certain goal.

*** IMO there are two different kinds of flaws:

1. Flaws that really are flaws, the kinds of things that interfere with a character being able to achieve their stated objectives. If your character has a temper, and acts in ways that he later regrets, or he struggles with fear and running away from fights, which he later wishes that he had fought, then that's a fixable flaw, one that the character wants to change because of the way that it impacts their life. Alcoholism or addiction belong in this camp as well.
2. Flaws that are just a part of the character, ways in which /other people/ might want them to be different. Someone might be arrogant, but internally, they don't see that as a flaw, they see it as them actually being superior to other people, and they do nothing to change their attitude, because they think that's the right attitude to have. Other people would change them, sure, but they wouldn't change themselves. These are sometimes small flaws: a character might talk at length about certain subjects no one else cares about, or have an obsessive interest that no one shares, or be overly gregarious, or naturally distrustful, or something else that's not necessarily the focus of the story.

Generally speaking, the first type of flaw is resolved through grit and determination in stories, while the second type of flaw, if it's resolved at all, gets resolved through a character having some moment of introspection and realization that really, this thing that everyone else has a problem with is something that /they/ have a problem with too, or unexpected costs that they're not willing to pay. But some of these "flaws" are just quirks of the characters that are unendearing to most people.

*** I think as long as you have their personality in your head, you've got all the 'good parts' of making your characters flawed. Giving someone the 'make your characters flawed' advice is usually shorthand for 'they are all the same optimal-path-seeking-robot-person. They all do the same things given the same information. Write different characters!'

If your characters have different personalities, I think you are doing fine. Whether their flaws or virtues predominate is less important than making sure that they aren't all just masks worn by the same reasoning process.

That's the problem! Most of my characters would take a widely different approach to the same problem, and it's occasionally showcased in the stories proper. Some of them make wrong decisions, some of them try hard-core to find the optimal solution, some often just act on their emotions, etc. Still, the most common criticism I hear by far is that my characters lack meaningful flaws.

So I don't think this is the case, honestly.

*** I do enjoy writing in reverse (when I do get the time to do so). I have a very systematic method based on the old World of Darkness storytelling books. On it, there are lists of potential flaws and attributes. I usually do the following:

1. Do as the Venture Bros writer recommended, and think of what scene I want to play out.

2. Think of the character as a blob of features and make a rough sketch of what traits and reaction I would want it to have.

3. Use the WoD rulebook (the one closest to the character I want, for example the vampire rulebook for goth/classic villains, the changeling book for the trickster archetypes or mage: the ascension when I don't find anything that fits).

4. Decide what threat level I want it to be, even if its a socialite type. I decide the level and use the XP points assigned to select traits that resemble what I want the character to be able to do.

5. Go to the flaw list and select the ones closes to the character I want.

6. After that's done, I adapt the flaws and attributes to better resemble my concept of a character. This way I make it more fleshed out rather than simply having a roleplaying character.

7. Then simply write the backstory based on those attributes and finally to make it more rational, think of a realistic way it would lead to that scene.

I think authors like the ones from Venture Bros and Kinoko Nasu of Fate/Stay Night enjoy using that roleplaying based method to craft the characters. Now I do prefer using the World of Darkness rulebooks over say D&D because in my opinion the attributes are more balanced.

Like I have no idea what is the wisdom attribute, but I can make it a specialty in the character sheet with a high intelligence attribute focused towards it. And if the character is a plotter type rather than a trickster, choosing a low Wits attribute. If he's good at fighting but slow to act, then add high Dextery or high Resolve and so on.

For example I may have an idea for a character and it'd be a cool detail to make it ambidiextrous or have a retainer, but not think of it thoroughly or forget but if I have a character sheet with me I can remember and use that in the story.

** Can someone tell me why Worm by Wildbow isn't published/available for purchase anywhere yet? I get that it takes time to edit and publish a novel but it's been more than 6 years since Worm ended and you generally want to publish as soon as possible to take advantage of the momentum and fanbase you've built up all those years.

Maybe it's not as popular as I think yet to make a crude comparison: [[/r/Stormlight_Archive]] has 4.3 times as many readers as [[/r/parahumans]] and it's been on the New York Times Best Sellers list and Sanderson is the most successful fantasy author. I think being 'just' 4.3 less popular than the market leader would make publishers rush to put Worm to market. And with the success of 50 Shades Of Grey as I would assume publishers wouldn't just write off a webnovel just because it's a webnovel. What gives?

*** I think this is mostly just Wildbow failing to capitalize. An e-book of Worm, even one that was /just/ the "unedited" text that's up now, would be a continual source of income for relatively little investment on his part, especially if the minor work involved was done by someone else. Yes, traditional publishing and traditional editing would be a better way to go, but it's been six years, and if he's not putting in the time and effort for traditional publishing, it would be better to have put it up himself. As it stands now, people keep reading Worm on his website and sharing e-books that they've scraped themselves: some fraction of these people would have bought an e-book, just for the convenience of it. More than that, since he started writing a sequel, it would have allowed a pipeline from e-book readers to serial readers, which means more in terms of patronage.

It's possible that he just doesn't care about money, but that's probably not it, because he regularly posts on personal finance and financial independence subreddits. I think it's mostly just a case of perfect being the enemy of good, and holding patterns being easy to maintain.

** So I was watching Devs the other day and an interesting question got asked and I'd like to see what your answers to it might be. It's not really a spoiler, but I'll put it in spoiler tags just in case:\\
I'm paraphrasing here but it was basically this, "If we live in a deterministic universe, and we have a device that can look into The future, what's to stop us from setting it to 2 minutes into the future, seeing ourselves cross our arms, and then refusing to cross our arms for the next 2 minutes?" This really stumped me because throughout the first 3 episodes of the show it was made fairly clear that the people with the computer that can look forward and backward in time were convinced that the universe is deterministic and my understanding was that in a deterministic universe whatever future you saw was one which presupposed you saw it, so your actions as a result of seeing it wouldn't change that future. The only way I can rationalize this is if seeing the future would necessarily result in peoples' actions aligning with what they saw, so they would feel like they didn't have to cross their arms but they would inevitably "decide" to do it anyway...which still doesn't feel very compelling to me.\\
It's a pretty good show so far, I think it would probably appeal to most people here.

**** Yeah, this was my thought as well. If the machine essentially just computes the universe for N time to see the future, that means it has to compute itself computing the universe, and itself computing itself computing itself, and so on.

A alternative would be a machine that functions off of stable time loops, a-la HPMOR time-turners. No computation of the universe, it doesn't even necessarily have to be deterministic, it's just that the order of cause and effect can be reversed.

Of course, this also can be used to solve the halting problem like a oracle (though i can't remember or find the exact term) by creating a loop with two possible outcomes:

A: a solution to a difficult problem appears

B: a paradox occurs, which, by definition, cannot occur.

But in reality, there's a third option

C: the system breaks in a way that sends a false positive or otherwise creates a loop without a solution.

I do not know enough about time travel to state with confidence how the universe would 'decide' between the two options. I would /guess/ that it's probabilistic, based on the likelyhood of the current system evolving to contain and transmit that information in the future/casual past.

So, *if* this is the case, then a future-seeing machine would be... exceedingly unlikely, depending on how much information it gives you. In the extreme case, it would be equivalent to selecting a single worldline out of /all/ (infinite) possible worldlines. Sending a physical object like a human would also be unlikely, seeing as a human is rather complicated.

Simple information would be much less complicated; you could very well say that you cross your arms in the future, and then you decide not to. The only thing actually set in stone is that you send the message back stating that you cross your arms. If you are particularly determined to not send any message back if you get a message, then chances are that you just /don't/ create a loop in the first place.

There would always be a reason/way to think about it. You would only ever look into the machine when it was showing things you couldn't control, or your knowledge from the machine is factored into the machine's predictions already, or the entire universe “conspires” to make it happen (like a chain of events already in motion before you even look at the machine, like since the start of the universe, leads to a guy with a gun forcing you to cross your arms showing up just in time).

Determinism is really hard to think about when people are involved, and when the events are the result of macro/social/human scale systems. It tends to make humans think that the only way it could happen is with some kind of intelligence pulling the strings, but that's just a weakness in human cognition. There is no reason to believe causality just buggers off at a certain scale. Superdeterminism ftw
