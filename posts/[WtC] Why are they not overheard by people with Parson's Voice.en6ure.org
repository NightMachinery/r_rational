In chapter 149 of Worth the Candle (spoilers!) (when Joon is at Sound & Silence), they mention how communicating with Reimir might be difficult, even if they pay for him to have Parson's Voice:

#+begin_quote
  Parson's Voice was short range, and wouldn't work outside of (roughly) the same large city, not that we'd want to outfit him with a tattoo, given how expensive they were, and the fact that he would be privy to conversations we'd want to keep private.
#+end_quote

As far as I understand it, this means that they can't control who listens in on things said through Parson's Voice (inside its range). Thus, anyone in the same city who happens to have the tattoo will listen in on whatever they say. Is that really how it works, or did I miss something?


** I think I remember it working by choosing a frequency when you get the tattoo. Meaning if they want to use it to communicate with reimer, they'd get him one with the same frequency and he could listen in to everything, since frequency can't be changed. I'm not sure if this is correct though.

*** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/391725/sound-and-silence][They]] don't explicitly say "frequency"

Emphasis mine:

#+begin_quote
  The tattoo had two basic functions, the first being push-to-talk, and second being always-on. All you had to do to switch between the two was place your fingers in a different spot. The always-on mode was, unfortunately, extremely annoying to everyone on the other end, and the tattoo was indiscriminate in sending things out to everyone on your *local network*.
#+end_quote

A few paragraphs later, Grak expresses concerns about being overheard while discussing the narrative, and Juniper seems to think the most likely form of eavesdropping is to listen in person rather than tap into the network.

**** They don't explicitly say frequency, but the first explicit mention of Parson's Voice in ch 110 compares them to walkie talkies, which generally do need to be set to the same frequency/channel. "Local network" in that context just means "every one else who is in the group". It's distinct from a channel, in that not everyone can join just by knowing the channel number.

It's not in the text, but the method for joining is to press two of the Parson's Voice tattoos, which will set them to be on the same "network", e.g. if A, B, and C are communicating with each other through Parson's Voice, D can gain access from either A, B, or C. It wasn't mentioned mostly because I hoped it would be clear enough without that, and including a line or two about its function might be taken as foreshadowing. It's secure, so long as you trust the other people not to share/give access.

*** I haven't read any of the source material so this may be a ridiculous suggestion, but would it be feasible to get two tattoos, so they can have one for their private conversations and for conversations between them and Reimir?

**** They keep complaining that the tattoo is much more expensive that what it's worth. The only reason they have any is because they were a gift of sorts.

*** That would make sense. I can't find that information anywhere though. (I searched for both "Parson's Voice" and "frequency" in the text and read around a bit.) It's possible it was mentioned on reddit or something.

** Kinda interesting that you got stuck on this.

Parson's voice always struck me as saner "Worth The Candle" type of implementation of the old party chat trope found in LitRPG/The Gamer fics. (Oh I'm sure you can trace it - in some form - to a D&D sourcebook from before time or something. Let's not.)

As far as security goes, in gamer fics it's usually a power that's exclusive to the gamer.

/Hurr durr it's just like Discord/Teamspeak/Ventrillo/Xbox-voice video games./

In it's transition to Aerb, as a power that's available to anyone skilled in Skin magic, both the average reader and I'm guessing the author just kinda assumed that it works like Discord or Teamspeak or whatever and that was that. Because I do not remember the mechanisms for Parson's voice being explicitly explained. And in all honesty - not everything needs to be explained in excruciating detail. /It's party chat. Got it./ And so, this is probably where you're getting hung up on - you missed that little wink between the audience and the author.

Anyway [[/u/Hydroxxx]]'s explanation makes sense. There's some space for customising the tattoo to "tune-in the frequency".

I wonder if a hostile skin mage could steal one and just spend ten hours screaming into it, just like that griefing asshat on <your favourite video game with voice chat>.

*** I really like the offhand mention of the Calamities solution to battlefield communication in APGtE being little balls of silver implanted under the skin near the jaw/ears that Warlock basically enchanted into bone induction microphones. It only gets like 2 lines of discussion but it's really easy to see how they would realistically be the only people with that sort of technique simply because Black wouldn't take no for an answer on making realtime cross-battlefield communication happen and Warlock is exactly the sort of person who would come up with a solution like that. Actually taking advantage of magic to jump several hundred years ahead on the conventional tech tree instead of just finding new and more creative ways to blow the enemy up.

I'm not sure I'd agree with this at all. Battlefield communication and coordination is one of those Big Obvious problems that soldiers/generals have been aware of and solving for... basically as long as there have been soldiers and generals.

There's a reason so much of the communication. technology we use was developed by/for the military, and what wasn't was quickly taken up.

Trying to solve that problem isn't particularly new or innovative, and solving it with magic is just... what would happen in /any/ competent military in a magical world.
