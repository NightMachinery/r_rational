"In which Light's personality doesn't change when he loses his memories of the Death Note, and he deduces that the only possible solution to the Kira Case is that he's Kira and just doesn't remember it---or that Ryuzaki is Kira and framed him for it."

Yes, this is a Death Note fanfic. It's not really a rational fic (it suffers from all of the same flaws as the original Death Note, which is to be expected since it's a divergence fic rather than a reimagining), but in the same vein, it's also just as entertaining as the original. (Plus, Death Note is probably much closer to being "rational" than most other stories out there anyway.) Suffice to say, if you enjoyed the original Death Note, you'll probably enjoy this story. The author has an excellent grasp of the characters and it definitely shows.

If you have some free time, or if you're looking for some entertainment, check it out.


** Definitely agree that this is pretty good stuff. It does suffer from the same problems as the source material, but that doesn't mean it isn't an interesting story in its own right.

What I find really interesting are the author's notes and the short analyses at the end of some of the chapters, notably the one about Matsuda after chapter 5. He really has a good grasp on these characters and literary structure, and it shows in both the story itself and these little asides.

** I had fun reading this. I like the idea. In one chapter there were a lot of passages in () in between dialogue, which I felt was difficult to read. I'll stay tuned for more updates!

** Hmm, it's an interesting take on it and pretty well written, but it's absurdly slow. After 9 chapters they're still in the exact same situation they started in.
