  For a long moment, the ship was confused. But eventually, an exhaustive search produced a series of similar images, which confirmed---

  The human was attempting to provide the ship with happiness!

  The ship /was/ happy, at that---not as a result of the physical action, which seemed unlikely to produce any direct effect, but at the mere recognition that /here/ was a behavior whose /sole motivation/ was a general increase in pleasure and joy, an altruistic conversion of calories to hedons. Immediately, the ship vibrated in response, to signal its delight...

** Well, I called the existence of the ship, but that was straight out of canon anyway so it was kind of cheating. We'll see if it can unlock the Chee themselves like it could in canon.

Puppyship is cute, but I'm a little disturbed by how it's so focused on pure hedonistic happiness. Like, it was about to drug Tobias into a stupor before the Chee stopped it. What would it do during a space battle?

I was way more disturbed by the swarm of flying ticklebots.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

It sounds like the ship obeys the Key holder regardless of predicted happiness, and the Chee cut the active link specifically so Tobias could talk about violence. I wonder if the Ellimist orchestrated the TPK so Tobias would be resurrected as a new "person", one who the Chee had never directly seen commit violence.

*Edit:* Like, the Chee obviously understand he's the same person, but the Censor isn't exactly a Chee mind. Maybe it can be fooled by the different Z-space signals, from the new instantiation of the morphing power?

*Edit 2:* In that first interlude, the Chee didn't seem all that shocked by the fact that teleportation happened, just confused about why. I wonder if the Pemalites had that kind of technology?

*** I got the impression that the Pemalites had a greater tolerance for hedons (either naturally or by long exposure), so what Puppyship was planning to do wouldn't have been an overload for them---but Tobias is a human who is unused to Pematech, so the Chee had to ask Puppyship to tone down its plans.

*** Foreboding because the super puppy ship /thinks/ it's following Tobias's instruction, but is already subtly diverging? Or because all the references to joy reminded you that canon!Howlers were also creatures of pure joy, just programmed by Crayak to think killing is fun, and now you're worried that r!Howlers are actually r!Pemalites whose ancestors were captured and corrupted?

  "Jake, oooh baby, you are the man for me. I love your big manly shoulders. I love your piercing brown eyes. (They are brown, right?) But most of all, I love the macho, manly way you boss us all around, snapping out orders left and right. I think of you as the new Clint Eastwood. I must have you all to myself. Signed, Cassie. XXX."

#+begin_quote
  The holder of the Key was a shape the ship did not recognize, for it had spent only a very short time in the water before its masters had sent it to sleep

  ---for it was linked by gentle embrace with its makers' /other/ children, the Friends, and could know anything they knew---

If it knows everything 'the Friends' know, why doesn't it recognize the giant squid? Or is that functionality still booting up from sleep?

Good News everyone!

Also, I miss Garret chapters. The way you're able to write his viewpoint, and his... Simpler? Way of seeing tbr world is a great change of pace from the thoughts within thoughts within thoughts of the rest.

In this chapter specifically, I'm still kot sure I understand exactly what is going on with the ship RE it's ability to understand and communicate. But I think that's because I'm not thinking about it hard enough yet - I was just so stoked to post

Marco saying 'we kind of like Rachel now' is a really, really good way to remind people that Marco is in eighth grade. That is such a 13 year old thing to say - it's a credit to your writing you can weave immaturity (or at least the same outcomes that come from immaturity) with raw... Intelligence and strength.
