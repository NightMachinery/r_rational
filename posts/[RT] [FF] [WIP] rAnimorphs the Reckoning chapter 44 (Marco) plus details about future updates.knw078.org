** "/Hmm, the smooth, dangerous ships pouring across the bridge, it almost feels like/-"

Thousand-yard stare, flashback to the Rachel chapter

".../it would be really, really bad if these were Howlers/."

Grisly, shocking, nightmarish. This is the most horrifying chapter I've read - probably of anything - in memory.

Incredibly compelling stuff, as always. Couldn't tear myself away, as always. Great way to ring in the new year.

Completely did not even consider that the Howler icon V3 downloaded from the big sky computer came complete with, like, brains and guts and stuff. Here I assumed it was just a hollow 3D model like you'd see in a video game - just a statue of a Howler. Hmm, knowing now that the model was a little more detailed, I wonder why the Visser didn't already have notes on Howler strengths and weaknesses - not even in like an "oh yeah I remember now, the anuses are behind the knees" type of way. I guess he just never thought he'd encounter one in battle, so it didn't hook his curiosity beyond the obvious 5G brain stuff.

Also, MAN was that ever satisfying to read. Like, unholy amounts of terrifying, seeing how vast and powerful the Visser has become, but so much fun to experience. It really, really captured what (I assume) it would actually be like to have 200k instances of yourself, and grand, sweeping control over all of them. Is there anything left that can and would take him out besides a quantum virus or the literal Care Bears convincing him to be friends with everyone?

I'm so pumped that we might actually, really, for realziez be in the actual for-real home stretch now.

P.S. I've been toying with the idea of doing a sort of "Annotated r!Animorphs" - like, a chapter-by-chapter document with little footnotes and highlights and things, like a spoilery guide for people going back through, drawing specific attention to puzzles that got solved later or spelling out things that only got implied in the text. I feel like it would help me personally to keep the trillion threads organized in my head, and could be useful as a refresher or reference material or whatever. Definitely not for first-time readers. Obviously it would take some time to produce and could use other eyes for input as well. Would anyone be interested in this?

/Weathered.  Cold.  Like---like Stonehenge, or dinosaur bones, or something---old enough that all the soft parts had eroded away, and what was left would last for ten thousand years./

Spoiler for Animorphs canon that is possibly relevant to The Reckoning's next chapters:

I have a bit more appreciation now for Crayak's fear and rage toward Jake for being able to tap into the howlers' collective memory and already being too calloused to really be affected by it, while his own capacity for love causes significant shift in them. And he doesn't just give them a desire to kiss either, since Edriss is arguably the most loathsome mortal character in the series and she loves being in love. Sorry if I'm digressing too much, I just found the description of the howlers' rampage and the Marclones' frustration impactful.

Second, people only change if they have incentive to. For the yeerks, both in this fic and in canon, that incentive took the form of "we just killed thousands of you motherfuckers and we'll do it again if we have to".

The canon resolution for Howlers didn't really have anything stopping them from going to back to murderhoboing once they got bored of love and frienship.

According to r!Animorphs canon, when the meteor hit in Ventura, the "gate" that brings Cassie's original body back from the pocket dimension (the nanotechnology that swims around in the Animorphs' bloodstreams) was fully destroyed.

For some reason, the Howlers regard this group of people as valuable. We don't know why, and Marco doesn't know why, but if something is valuable to an enemy, there may be tactical benefit in denying it to them.

They may be holding these people for ransom, or for interrogation, or to preserve a breeding population, or maybe just for sport. Rescue would obviously be the preferable option, but if that's not possible (and it doesn't currently seem to be), then Marco's action is his only way of denying the Howlers whatever benefit they're planning to get from the people.

If it turns out they were hosting a peace accord between Howlers and humans in that stadium, then I'm sure that Marco will feel horrible about that decision. That, or anything similarly benign, seems like a low-probability guess, though.

** I think you should remove the mention of COVID-19 and keep the timeline vaguely specified. It takes away from the story by how COVID was never mentioned before, and still has unforeseeable consequences in the real world, so it might diverge from in-universe.

The timeline can not be before 2020, and it can not be during 2020 or 2021, so it must be much later - but then if it plays out differently in real life you just have a weird alternative timeline trivia thing for no useful reason.

*** Upvoted, but I've had this concern raised before, and I disagree.

Five years from now, COVID-19 will be part of the fabric of history in /exactly/ the same fashion as 9/11; people would have objected (in 2002) to a 9/11 mention but today take it completely in stride, and indeed today would consider it weird if a vaguely-present-or-near-future story did /not/ have 9/11 sort of baked into its past.

I get that this is a cost I'll be paying in the moment (I am not dismissing your loss of immersion), but I strongly believe it's the right cost to pay, and that this will be the better way to go in the long run, esp. since the fic has been roughly pinned down to the late 2020's by a few little bits of data here and there (a day of the week given a specific date, Mattis referred to as the former Secretary of Defense, etc). This universe's Marco lived through it as a small child, and was hearing about it all throughout elementary and middle school; it's absolutely "the sort of thing he would think of when trying to put a weight on a large number of deaths."

The pandemic would still be fresh in the minds of many, so people would be quick to compare the varied and disparate geopolitical responses to the invasion as being like covid all over again, but also way worse because the enemy actually /is/ a sentient and silent invader this time around.

As for specific spots, one place could be in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/19139185][Reddit interlude right after the bug fighter crash]].

** Helllll yes, it's back! Now taking bets as to whether this fic will actually finish before 2022! (Just kidding, we love you TK17... but yeah)

Love the worldwide Marco POVs - makes everything very epic.

The beast from the off-world excursion has finally made its reappearance - and it's not enough!

The howlers are terrifying villains, and I love how the Animorphs are being forced into a scenario in which they have the option of teaming up with Visser 3 (probably still a terrible idea, though). Also love how Visser 3 is getting a chance to go all-out with his fighting. He's burning through all his tricks, which may even the playing field for later on and give the Animorphs a decent shot at taking him out (especially when Tobias shows up again from wherever he is with the Puppyship. Hopefully he's watching the Mars base and seeing how V3 makes the quantum virus so he can replicate it somehow).

Okay, so given that Cassie is listed as one of the future chapters, I suspect she might have survived the Ventura explosion. It would have taken out her morph body, leaving her awake in the morph emulation, where she could demorph after a delay. I suspected this a long time ago, in fact, but I wasn't sure whether this was plausible (she might have been rendered unconscious in the morph emulation and died as the Z-space machinery collapsed, or might have been forced to demorph into an ongoing fireball where she would have died in her body). It still might not be plausible - maybe the chapter is a Cassie clone from somewhere, or something else.

Oh yeah, and I never commented on the last chapter because I was busy, but that was great too! Still don't know what's up with Rachel or the whole time-travel thing.

Very excited for the ending!

****** I would say that I do also expect that it would be very hard to exploit a lot of their programming, since we don't see them e.g. commit violence very often, but to stick with violence as the example, we have at least one example of a Chee seeming to do it (during the Howler attack on the Pemalites.) Basically I would expect that even if the Pemalites are significantly better programmers than we are, a computer bug which is relevant once in a million years is going to be noticed by sentient robots who have million year life spans and can engage in the sort of analysis we see them do in four seconds.

I may be wrong and maybe the Pemalites were more nuanced in how they chose to design the Chee. The story isn't over yet and I may be misremembering some bits.

  why the Chee can't model Rachel?
#+end_quote

I wonder if we're overthinking this. The two bits of evidence for this are that they call her "the female" instead of her name in the first interlude, and that they give her the weapons despite Erek seeing her kill V3's remote body at the high school. (And I guess indirectly the fact that she's "not suppose to be there".) Both can be explained by Erek deliberately thinking a violent thought right after the hypersight event, so the Censor would wipe his mind before information about Rachel could be shared with the group.

Are there other examples of the Chee not understanding Rachel besides those two?

Do you have a specific worry here, or just general paranoia? (Which is well-justified, of course.)

Seems like it could also be really useful. In canon it was basically an instant win against them. I'm not sure TK would make things that easy, but even just being able to read their collective memory would be good, and I think you could do that without giving the host any sensory or other input that would be useful to them. Maybe feed them false info? And of course a howler body would be great in a fight, though that's not necessarily the animorphs' most pressing concern these days.

** I got the impression that Marco Prime was going to do a noble sacrifice and die in the blast on my first read, but on a second run through it's a bit more ambiguous. It says the bomb will destroy everything in the stadium, and ‘wreck' a half-mile radius. Is the goose fast enough to get to a point where the explosion will ‘only' kill and not vaporise the bird body? In any other work of fiction, I'd say this is a textbook heroic sacrifice, but if there's a character that would mercy kill a stadium with a mini nuke and try to outrun the blast, it's r!Marco, who is not in the habit of needless sacrifice, especially when this Marco is also 25% of Visser 1. On the other hand, the narration doesn't give hints that he's trying to survive, which is why I missed it the first time, and he might not have thought out the possibility of survival, seeing as it didn't occur to the other 2 that died this chapter.

(Geese can fly 40-50mph in level flight, and faster if they're angling downward, and Marco had twenty seconds to book it as far as possible, so he would make it at least 40% of a mile before the strike actually occurred.)

** So I've been scouring the fic for clues about what time of year it is, and everything seems indicate that this chapter takes place pretty close to Halloween/day of the dead.

(Than's warning in chapter 30, timestamped by Esplin's chapter immediately prior and Marco's claim a few chapters later that late June was a few weeks away, along the fact that the pool ship was blown up on the 7th of October.)

That's a nice touch if true, but with that in mind, Thule air force base in Greenland is just about the worst possible place to headquarter the human resistance during a Howler invasion. [[https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/greenland/thule-air-base][Time and Date]]'s sunlight chart tells us that the sun sets on October 30th in Thule, and doesn't rise again until February 10th. They have 24 hours of night. If I were President Tyagi, I'd relocate to the South pole. No doubt they already have significant infrastructure in place left over from building the true ark.

**** Ouch at the caveat, fair though.

The good news, survival wise, is that I know what genre this is. This is Dragon Ball Z; Feeza's army is invading a new planet, and I am one of the nameless background characters that gets blown up to show how evil the villains are. I think I'd know the only goal I can pursue here is run and hide. Hopefully story!me and Marco set up some hidey holes as a fallback. If not find a cave. Right now what I would really want is a place that's too small for humans to actually enter. Air flow would be an issue, but if I take the other people into a morph with me, we could hide in places the invaders might not even bother to look.

I've actually been thinking about story!me's survival chances a bit, though much of that is somewhat tainted by the fact IRL!me has read the story. I can't forget facts I already know and then figure out how I would react with that lesser knowledge; at least not easily. One mistake I think I'd make early one is wanting to be more active at night, darkness is after all good for hiding and even though I'll notice the aliens all leave during the day I'd probably assume they were still watching from orbit or something.

One thing I noticed though, fully stepping back into the reader role. This whole story, with it's chess match between the gods and their simulated worlds. In a way it makes things like expected value a much more intuitive thing. There are some worlds where story!me lives and some where he dies, and the gods simulations mean that many of these worlds are real to a degree. Only one is instantiated based on the moves that the players make, and those moves are probably independent of an action story!me might choose to make (well there was that chapter where Ellimist does things like altering wind speed to send someone back for their coat, but most people don't get even that level of interest). Instead of saying things like, "I'll do this and then the result will be that and I get to live." One would have to think in terms of general strategies. If I behave in certain ways then the share of worlds where I survive will increase or decrease. The goal then is to find the strategy that would increase the survival chances the most and then the only thing to do is hope the gods pick one of those worlds as the one to actually happen.
