** Not a big fan of the layout for many of the pages, but i'll try it out.

The character page for example, should have a vertical mode or something where I can edit multiple characters or groups of people at once.

Edit:

One more critique. I understand that for many, there's a whole >2 genders in the world, but if I was to use the app, I would want to use it for fast prototyping, and so rather than a "type anything" field, consider a drop down list where I can select the standard "Male/Female" for gender, and then those that want to do things like 'genderfluid' or whatever it is, do an "add another" option, which lets people type into it and it gets added to their selected list.

Do you think that's doable?

*** Thanks for the feedback! Unfortunately I'm no designer (and did all the design myself), so I'm hoping to get someone who actually knows what they're doing to give the site a facelift sometime soon.

As for gender dropdowns, we're looking at a way to meet everyone in the middle on speed and customization right now. We're currently thinking about adding autocomplete populated with your existing values for some fields, so if you've created a Male and a Female character ever, when you click on that field you'll immediately see those two options (but can still type whatever you want). If you've added a third, you'll see those three options and can still type whatever, and so on. Do you think that would make prototyping fast enough for you here?

Also with the above, we're toying with the idea of adding a ton of "sample" content to some fields to allow a little more serendipitous exploration. For example, adding hundreds of different types of weapons to the autocomplete menu for "Favorite weapon", so [[http://i.imgur.com/YyJuUzF.png][you can type a few characters or just browse if you don't have an idea off hand]], then select from one of the many options. This may be a bit unrelated, but I wanted to ask what you thought about it because I could see it going in the opposite direction of what you're looking for here: do you think something like that might slow down your process, or do you think you'd find value in having autocomplete options on several fields?

Thanks again for your feedback, I'm glad you're getting some use out of Notebook so far, and I can't wait to see it improve for everyone. :)

** Does it interfaces with git?

*** Hi, developer here. It does not interface with git, but we're currently working on change logs (for a log of what changed on content, when) and data export features (in JSON and human-readable formats) as well as looking into two-way Dropbox/Drive sync for storing a copy on your own storage services. Just to clarify though, what functionality were you looking forward to getting from a git interface?

Edit: Just wanted to follow up and say data export (to a text-based outline, JSON, and CSV formats) is live and available from the dropdown in the top right of any page. :)
