** This may be my favorite chapter so far. The entire scene with everyone getting into everyone else's head was brilliant, beautiful, disturbing, and poignant. Somehow, it gave me the same emotions I felt reading the original series when I was a kid, when I was invested enough into the characters that they felt like friends.

The part where Rachel is talking to the morph of Marco - it was very indirect, and I'm still not /quite/ sure what it was about, but does Marco have a crush on Jake? I couldn't see another way to read that.

**** No, Rachel /thought/ she had one on Cassie, while she was mixed up in Jake's head, but she got squared away in the end. It's just Marco.

Poor, poor Marco. It's rather more than just a crush.

Edit: depending on how you view such things, I've either been /dropping hints/ or /laying the groundwork/ for a long time, now. There's Marco's distress when Jake goes comatose; Marco's reaction when Jake wakes up; his snide dig at Cassie when both of them waited to be the last one to talk to him, privately, by the fire; his previous intention (seen by Rachel) to morph Jake's body (that's why she already knows); etc. etc.

My hope is that this will feel sort of natural and obvious in retrospect, but also not have been big in everybody's faces up until this point (and not really after, either, as Jake doesn't return the favor and Marco's determined that it NOT MATTER).

Yes, "crush" was a bit of an understatement. I thought the passage in the chapter was a spot-on description of what it's like to be /desperately in love/ with your straight friend. I've been there before.

#+begin_quote
  There's Marco's distress when Jake goes comatose
#+end_quote

Well, I didn't quite take it that way. That seems like a normal reaction when your best friend goes comatose.

Aretii is right, I totally ship Jake and Marco. But that doesn't seem likely to happen. At the very least, I just want Jake to sit down with Marco in the next chapter and tell him that everything is OK, and that he loves Marco, even if it's not the same way.

I'm also getting that vibe from Garrett and Tobias. Especially in this chapter, when Tobias is hugging Garrett and "the fingers of his remaining hand [are] dancing in a complex pattern across Garrett's back."

I'm very much thinking of Tobias and Garrett as extremely close brothers rather than anything that would stretch into romance, and the specialized hug-ritual was a thing that emerged from that.

That being said, as Aretii points out, I can't control what people will and won't do with their own interpretations. =P

** I'm not great at keeping track of details. My guess is that the morphing messed with the Chee. They knew what was actually going on, but it was enough to trick the overrides. Rachel was morphed when she killed Visser Three, so technically Erek didn't see /her/. Was Tobias morphed? Or maybe they had contact with Tobias the whole time, and knew it was really him, but for all they knew that could have been someone else morphed as Rachel they were talking to.

Some amazing character development for Rachel. It's been discussed previously that the Chee never refer to Rachel by name, so what's really going on here? This is like she's got a TARDIS perception filter or something? Does it work only on the Chee?

** Really good chapter. Additionally, it is /so refreshing/ to see an author willing to a) sympathize with, even to an extent and b) give competence to Rachel. Even canon started to twist her character unrealistically away from her original guiding principles. This, of course, with everyone having an intelligence (or rationality) upgrade is slightly different, but the character holds true to what drives and steers her, only changing as she comes across more - or different - information, which she does not dismiss offhand. I always thought Rachel, canonical or otherwise, was a character with a lot of potential beyond being used as a tool or a weapon and it's nice to see someone sharing that view.

That's quite the cliffhanger to leave it on, also!

*** I wonder how much of the "took to be used" characterization comes from the end of the series when the kids are all battle hardened by PTSD and have nothing left to lose. The starfish book reveals a Rachel who is desperately afraid of her ability to sink into battle; her character arc in canon is one of the most tragic IMO. Not that I don't love this characterization, but r!Rachel is on a very different path.

**** Yes, and this Rachel's ability to view the battle and beyond it, the war, and in so doing recognize the flaw in carrying out missions for missions' sake (that would have strongly contributed to the gradual PTSD buildup /in/ canon) felt like a deliberate dig at canon. This Rachel is able to anticipate the path her canon predecessor may have gone down.

I think the author does a good job of showing that's due to a large amount of strong trauma hitting her earlier than her canon counterpart, though, and her core principle being her ability to bear and work through difficulties and trials, exactly the skills needed to get through that, rather than this Rachel being a Mary Sue like figure.

****** True! To be honest, even canon Rachel was a really refreshing character. For the blonde, gymnastic all-american girl to also be the heavy firepower, the warrior, /and/ the ruthless one was I think for the time a huge subversion of what that character would normally be and do. I liked that Applegate throughout kept all of those aspects of her character and let her be all those things at once, while keeping it logically consistent with her desire to succeed and do what needed to be done in order to achieve that success, rather than seeing those characteristics as naturally disparate and Rachel as having to transition from one set to the other.

I feel a lot of fanfiction authors, at least for Animorphs, lose that nuance when writing her.

** There may be something very significant going on regarding Rachel and how the gods and Chee behave with her. I list all my observations that may be relevant, and basic assumptions and questions about those observations. Others can theorize from these.

Observation 1:

Rachel was specifically mentioned as a surprise to Ellimist's/Crayak's/The Arbiter's (ECA's) model.

Observation 2:

The prophecy failed to mention Rachel being present for Elfangor's landing, but she was present. Assumption 2.1: The prophecy occurred after her birth.

Observation 3:

The Ellimist/Crayak was able to teleport Rachel, but did not mention her being one of the Four.

Observation 4:

The Ellimist/Crayak said that Visser Three would send the asteroid because of yeerk starvation. Observation 4.1: He teleported two yeerks who knew otherwise. Assumption 4.2: The oatmeal experiments would not be hard for him to see. Observation 4.3: Visser Three knew explicitly that starvation was not the true reason for the asteroid.

Observation 5:

The Chee never mention Rachel by name. Assumption 5.1: The Chee are not sexist with humans.

Observation 6:

The Chee gave Rachel a cube and a shredder, when they have told Tobias that humans observed to be violent cannot be given weapons. Observation 6.1: The Chee have lied before. Observation 6.2: The Chee are acting as if they want the Animorphs to trust them now. Assumption 6.2.1: This would be an easy lie to catch quickly, and the Chee know it.

Observation 7:

In an interlude, Visser Three was given knowledge of a z-space hole, and Alloran was simultaneously silenced. Assumption 7.1: Esplin will act differently if Alloran is conspicuously silent, so this would make for an inaccurate simulation. Unknown 7.1.1: Was this a simulation by ECA? Unknown 7.1.2: If so, have these last few chapters also been part of that simulation? Observation 7.2: During this possible simulation, Esplin specifically noted that the oatmeal was not the real reason for the asteroid. Assumption 7.2.1: This fact must have been apparent to the simulator.

tl;dr We have a blip in ECA's model about Rachel, a possible blip in the Chee's thoughts about Rachel, an inconsistency in Ellimist's/Crayak's story about the asteroid, and an unexplained silencing of Alloran in what may or may not be a simulation.

** Typo: "We had left the green-brown hills of southern California the following morning and headed west", pretty sure that should be east.

I tore up a few times during the mind meld, notably when Jake hugs Marco.

We have a Chee doing violence to the Howlers, and we have the Chee returning weapons to Rachel. Two proposed explanations for the latter are morphs counting as different identities, and "something to do with why they never use Rachel's name". I like these, but I think the Howlers are important, and I would guess that the two events have related explanations.

I'm also not sure of the morph explanation, because that also needs to suppose that they want the Animorphs to have the weapons (or they wouldn't have returned them) but can't tell them how to bypass the protocols, not even by describing them in sufficient detail that the flaw becomes clear. It's possible, but epicycles.

My reading of the last interlude was that there is some sort of refresh cycle among the Chee every ~0.7 seconds, whose function includes deleting Chee-minds as a last resort against protocol violations, including "thought-crime". This happened to Erek and the other Chee. But if the actions take less than 0.7 seconds, you just might be able to do the job.

|"something to do with why they never use Rachel's name"

Also, I remember something in the first interlude about how the Ellimist and Crayak had incomplete models of reality where surprises still happened, and Rachel was one such surprise. So far we have zero evidence that the Ellimist communicates his plans to the Chee, but it is still possible that these are related.

I seem to recall that the prophecy the Andalites received didn't mention Rachel at all. Can't remember which chapter it was in, maybe one of Ax's.

Look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/15/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 2]]:

#+begin_quote
  On Earth, a girl is born. Her name is Rachel, and she is not supposed to be there.
#+end_quote

And in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/29/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 7]], a direct Chee perspective:

#+begin_quote
  Besides, Garrett Steinberg and Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill and the female returned from their foraging excursion
#+end_quote

The Chee seem to be incapable of storing information about Rachel, referring to her as "the female", even though she's been part of the group for longer than Ax and has a much shorter name.

Being really good at following through is one thing, but she noted in this chapter that Garrett and Tom had the same grit. Rachel's true preternatural ability is that she is an anomaly, and plans seem to unexpectedly fail to account for her.

*EDIT:* And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/22/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 4]], an earlier Chee PoV:

As to why they would lie...I have no idea. Maybe it was necessary for him to back off. Or maybe it wasn't this at all, but instead the consequence of a move made in the game between Crayak and the Ellimist. Or perhaps instead, it might be related to Rachel's...unplannedness in that game.

*** Hmm. I forget, can the Chee detect that a person is morphed? Maybe the plausible deniability of Rachel possibly being someone else (whom they have not seen commit violence, since they don't know who they are) is enough ambiguity to satisfy their nonviolence protocols.

Thus, they couldn't give it to Tobias, because they were certain that he was really Tobias.

It certainly seems like said protocols are /not/ the same thing as their core values, since they frequently and knowingly work around them.

**** They can detect that a person is morphed, and who the original is, based on their telepathic communication. Look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/22/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 4]], which includes a Chee perspective right after the Ellimist/Crayak teleport from Ventura:

#+begin_quote
  [We have the situation under control. Peter Levy and Tom Berenson will not injure Ax. Based on the interlink signals, these others with me are Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]

  We do not understand. Where are their construct bodies?

  [They do not have any.]

  This is not a meaning.

  [They are emerging directly from the gate, with no construct to disassemble.]

  This is not a meaning.

  [There is no evidence of footsteps or other disturbances to the area around us. Whatever process brought us here likely also brought Peter Levy and Tom Berenson and Ax and the gates of Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]
#+end_quote

The "gate" is probably the link to Z-space for the morphers, and this is referring to the fact that they were teleported from Ventura in-morph but arrived out of morph.

Incidentally, this is why the teleport was so efficient for the Ellimist/Crayak: the gates themselves are many orders of magnitude lighter than the people.

Edit - There, I COMMENTED ON THINGS! WHICH IS GREAT! AND I AM DOING SO OF MY OWN FREE WILL. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A RESCUE MISSION AT THE FOLLOWING COORDINATES...

Seriously though, the mind-merge thing and its implications were nice. I think the problem the story is running into is that as the Animorphs get more breathing room and people involved, their most rational decisions also become the most boring ones. It's like how Superman stories never feature him constantly moving satellites into space and donating the money to charities: Superman's psychology aside, no one is interested about Superman having a boring but efficient job.

So as the military gets involved, the story moves from "we must blow up the yeerk pool as soon as possible or the aliens will win!" to "maybe we should give all our resources to the military and let them handle the invasion; it's not like they've never been involved in guerilla warfare before". So I'd expect the protagonists to either ignore or delay that option like they have so far (because they don't trust the military, because they don't want all hope for survival to be concentrated in one institution, etc), or to be cut off from help (because the government is compromised, or has incompatible goals, etc).

Otherwise, the story could move from them towards alien warlords, gods and presidents; or become about the Animorphs creating and maintaining a broader resistance, and struggling with the problems that come when you give superpowers to a large number of individual with their own goals and agendas.

***** Yeah. From the authorial perspective, this is probably a significant chunk of why I've struggled with the last few chapters. There are things in the offing that will shake up the plot, but in the meantime we're definitely in a dip. Partly it's been fun to explore /that/---to show the characters lost and confused and uncertain---but after a chapter or two that gets old.

My hope is that this will be the low point of the action, and that things will ramp up and accelerate as dominoes start to fall. In part, I expect the story to become more zombie-apocalypse-like, in the sense that we follow a small group through a large, complex world, and start to lose track of everything that's happening in that larger world as the small group struggles to survive and have an impact.

Also, I didn't mean to come across as ungrateful. I just apparently have a CouteauBleu addiction that's almost as bad as some people's r!Animorphs addiction. =) Hearts, stars, and horseshoes.

** So. The cube and the shredder. Given to Rachel.

The Chee said they could give them to a human but not one that they'd seen commit violence with them, not one they thought would commit violence with them.

This seems a reasonable statement, in light of their anti-violence safeguards.

Yet they gave both to Rachel.

Options:

- It is no longer possible to commit violence with that cube, that shredder. Important components have been removed or altered in a way that is not possible for Earth-level technology to fix or diagnose without months or years of research and re-tooling.

- The Chee are not associating Rachel with the same person as killed Visser Three back at the school. This implies some level of deliberate - and extremely careful - violation of their own safeguards. (Alternatively, perhaps they are deliberately not recognising Rachel as a sapient lifeform /so that/ they can ignore their safeguards when it comes to her - in the same way that they are not required to stop a wolf from killing a bunny, or a dog from hunting a squirrel). Or perhaps, between morphs and all, they are (deliberately) recognising that there is a non-zero chance that Rachel (in morph) is really Jake (in morph) or someone else that they haven't seen commit violence - and using that uncertainty over her identity to work around their own safeguards.

- Invisible Chee are following that cube and shredder /everywhere/, with the intent of making very sure that neither are /ever/ going to be used for violence in any way, shape or form.

The Rachel that we're seeing, that's been accompanying the others since Crayak or Ellimist teleported them away from the impact crater, isn't Rachel. It's a Chee wearing a hologram. It can take the shredder and cube because it is /not human/, and is in fact entirely incapable of violence.

The real Rachel is trapped in a virtual environment that exactly matches what the Chee wearing her shape is seeing, and that Chee is exactly matching her movements. So, she thinks she's there, but she's acting at a remove, through a proxy. The others managed to obtain her shape (and memories) (and her theirs) by means of Chee technology being able to hack the morph technology (or perhaps Crayak/Ellimist magic). (Or possibly Ellimist/Crayak morphed Rachel into a Yeerk who's inside the Chee's head, being carefully fed information by Chee technology).

The illusion will hold until such time as Rachel tries to do something violent and the Chee repeating her actions is not able to miss without her noticing, or as soon as Rachel tries to give the shredder or cube to one of the actual humans.

** So first and foremost, holy crap this chapter was amazing.

Marco's crush was subtle but made a lot of sense when revealed. I didn't catch that being his reason for morphing Jake initially, to see if he felt the same.

I also really like Rachel's kinship to Tom in this. Tom feels like a great character to explore who didn't get much exploration in canon. Tom was someone that Jake looked up to. And he's Rachel's cousin. And considering how Rachel and Tom's relationship in canon played out, I'm really excited to see them work and fight together as opposed to against one another.

Also, this hasn't been brought up yet, but I'm fairly certain David is David from canon. David's father in canon was NSA, which fits with his father being DHS this time around. Especially with the Animorphs moving towards recruitment at the same time as recovering the Blue Box, it seems all too likely. Granted, this David is a bit younger, but the prospect of a rational David rogue stress testing the Animorphs recruitment methods with all of the changes from canon is terrifying. I think one of David's biggest strengths as a character from canon was having a truly unrestrained/ possibly sociopathic approach to the morphing power. And gives yet another, "The world isn't split into Good people and Death Eaters" slant to this.

And since I know feedback is welcome, I got a little lost when Rachel went from remembering Marco's memories to opening Jake's memories. All of the other morphs had enough distinction that I knew there was a transition going on in my opinion. I don't know if this was just my reading comprehension, since I was able to see the distinction more clearly when I re read that part, but figured I'd put it out there.

I am, as always, blown away. Not only do you write multiple voices well, you also write a single voice experiences multiple voices well!
