  *A/N*: As the first chapter turned out to be quite popular, I have decided to continue where we left off and make this a full story! You can expect about 6 emotional and fast-paced chapters in total, with a (hopefully) satisfying climax in the end.

  Tirthika is the Buddhist concept known as the 'Outer Path': Basically, it refers to someone trying to take the easy way out to escape the cycle of pain known as Samsara, and contrasts with the correct 'Inner Path'.

So, I'll be honest: My main reason for continuing this story is that writing it is just too much fun! Gosh, Scar is just so enjoyable to write as a character. But, this should also satisfy those of you who thought that he won too easily in the first chapter! This is where we see what we could expect his rule to actually look like...

(The rational bedtime stories thing is a joke, but this chapter does in fact have a rational villain protagonist telling bedtime stories to a lion cub, and darn it I'm going to advertise the fact)

**** Haha, I know, he's just too nice to seem evil! But remember that even though he is telling bedtime stories to his favourite nephew in this chapter, the reason said nephew has nightmares is because Scar murdered his father one chapter ago.

One of the running ideas in my stories is that people are defined by their actions, not how they look or sound in front of others. So at the end of the last chapter I guess I saw Scar as kind of an anti-hero since he gave everyone immortality for free, but now I see him as kind of an anti-villain again since he took it all away just for a PR boost.

Also, I just wrote a chapter where Scar did something super evil/hilarious, so that might have primed me a bit.

***** sure, but any good consequentialist in scar's position would have probably done the same thing. killing mufasa doesnt make him evil because the actual expected consequences of that action given the information available to Scar are a net good for everyone. i mean, if you were Hitler's brother, wouldn't you kill him, even though he was still human?

** I like the implication that the drought is the result of Mufasa undermining his killer's reign from beyond the grave.

*** I'm glad you like it. That was my answer to one of my long-time quibbles with the Lion King: why on earth does everyone act like it's Scar's fault that there's a drought? I was going to just treat it like one of those classical political scenario's, where a good leader has a crisis during his reign and everyone blames him for it.

But then I realized it really works as a way to keep the conflict going, when you rememeber that scene where Mufasa's face appears in a storm and he seems able to influence the weather. Also, the part where lightning suddenly strikes everywhere during the final fight. Seems like some divine interference was going on there...

** This is way better than anything based on The Lion King 2 and Lion Guard ought to be. (kinda feel like the first chapter worked better as a standalone, though)

*** Yeh, I was a bit leery about expanding the story since I didn't want to take away from the original OneShot, which I was quite pleased with. But I kinda figured that if I wanted to write more chapters anyway, I might as well just post them and let those who want to read them read them.

Of course, I'm still hoping that I'll manage to make the full story sufficiently awesome that it'll eclipse even the original. :)

** I really enjoy these, I wouldn't mind reading periodic mini-series of more modern childhood classics if you get the chance between Need to Become Stronger
