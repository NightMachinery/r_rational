Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Contract magic allows people to make magically binding contracts both with others. Contracts with others allow magical consequences, including lethal ones, when one party breaks the contract. Contracts with self allows one to make personal sacrifices, including stuff like vows of poverty, to increase some of their abilities or skills by a margin depending on the strength of the sacrifice. Contract naturally follows the letter rather than the spirit of a contract. A full and correct understanding of a contract must be had for a contract to work. Contracts have to be entered voluntarily, they cannot be entered through coercion but can be entered in through manipulation.

How would you expect a society in which contract magic would be?

(On a more serious note, yes, you have a point and the wording of the contract can be refined. Nonetheless, I expect such contracts - which can be ignored until broken and which are actively beneficial to all parties to sign - to be a staple of such a society).

** Still working on the land of rampant plant growth. I think I've got things divided out more or less how I want them in terms of people and how they interact with the environment, and most of the biomes I think are neat/cool: trees stretching up to the skies with canopy coverage so complete that it's nearly pitch black at the bottom, mangrove swamplands that desperately claw more and more sediment in to make new lands, thick jungles where massive herbivores mow through the biomass almost as fast as it's made, a symbiotic swampland where the ground can't support trees and so everything is constantly growing over and building on what's beneath.

The plantlife needs water, sunlight, and other nutrients to grow, even if it's just a matter of activating the inherent magic of the world to get supergrowth. But if there's magic /there/, then why not magic in other places? Why not two or three other, human-centric magic systems that serve to either explore or enhance the setting? Here's what I've got:

- *Cultivation magic:* Unrelated to the xianxia concept. Growing some specific species of plants gives you the ability to tap into their magic and use it for various purposes, mostly related to command and control of plantlife and hypergrowth. A cultivation mage might have prehensile vines connected to a pot on his back, or he might depend on utilizing the plantlife that's all around him, whether that's for mundane utility like growing things, or changing the terrain in combat. Some of the specifics of this (and the use cases) need to be hammered out a little bit. The intent is that every cultivation mage has his own farm/orchard, or possibly a bonsai collection, in a world where space needs to constantly be defended and is at a premium. One method of attacking a cultivation mage is then to attack his base of power, which can be difficult. Attracts meticulous managers. Might need a different name. (Also thinking about what aspects the cultivation might require, like making bonsai or otherwise sculpting the plants to grow into specific shapes, similar to writing runes, but with a living thing.)

- *Blight mages:* Blight mages get their power from the biomass, sucking it dry in order to fuel their destructive magic. There's a bit of a feedback loop to this, as destruction of biomass makes it easier for more biomass to be destroyed. Balancing that out is a decay function for the magic which increases as power increases, until eventually there's no possible way for the blight mage to keep up with the drain. Secondarily, one of the costs for an initiated blight mage is that they have a continual and increasing baseline level of magic for subsistence, which is modulated by highest magic used. After 10 years, a typical blight mage will have to start devoting more and more time to simply having enough magic to live, and once they fall below their baseline (an inevitability), they will die. Blight mages are therefore useful for their ability to quickly kill plant life, but a blight mage also has a limited shelf-life. Ancillary powers are TBD, but effects beyond mere blight seem like they would be interesting, so long as I can keep them in theme. Exact effects of blight TBD, though it might be neat to have a separate blight biosphere that arises from plantlife and microbes that specialize in eating blighted biomass.

- *Wild mages:* This one I'm a little stuck on. If cultivation magic is a farming analog, and blight magic is a destruction analog, then I'd like for a third magic to be a magic of the old growth forests, places untouched by human hands, etc. How that's specifically manifested though ... that's hard to say in terms of what it costs, who can use it, and what it's capable of doing. As far as the former goes, biospheres are in a constant attempt to make the maximal use of energy (in this case, including magic), so maybe the wild mage benefits in some way from an environment that's at or close to biological equilibrium. They're naturally at odds with blight mages (who would burn the old growth down), with cultivation mages (who want to have everything ordered), and with civilization in general (which probably has designed on that land). As for what they can do ... I kind of like the idea that they get access to the same powers that make the biosphere grow, like light, water, air, and earth, but that might make them too close to a generic elemental mage. I also like the idea of them circumscribing an area that's "theirs", which might lead to them being naturally territorial and having to fight back against incursions. Kind of like a park ranger. Going through the pitch-black woods is /dangerous/, not just because of the darkness, but because there's sure to be a wild mage whose attention you really don't want.

- *Other magic:* I think three primary systems is good enough, but most of my favorite works just go absolutely nuts with magic. The trick is doing things that are allowed to be more "niche" than the main three, magics that can exist in the obscure corners of the world rather than being lynchpins of society. Might work more on that later, but symbiosis, photosynthesis, parasitism, spores, clonal organisms, grafts, biodiversity, etc. are all jumping off points.

*** *Cultivation magic:* If you can carry around your vine-tentacles, that seems to diminish the importance of having your own guarded plot of land. What about if the core of this type of magic is a ritual that allows the creation of sympathetic links between plants? You'd have your garden back home which is set up and carefully maintained to provide optimum growing conditions, and when you're out and about you carry more portable seeds. When you activate the sympathetic link, the seeds can draw on the energy and nutrients of the linked plants in the garden for explosive growth.

The diversity of options in this system could either come from the rare plants used (heat-seeking vines, acid-producing flytraps, explosive seedpods) or from other aspects of the sympathetic link (sharing damage between your living moss shirt and the oak in your garden).

This would mean that losing your garden would be an immediate blow to your abilities, as you'd have to make do by creating links with whatever plants are in your surroundings.

*Blight magic:* In terms of ancillary powers, perhaps there could be a degree of control over what happens to the blighted biomass? For example, if you blight a tree, perhaps you can control how the wood warps as it dies, and use that to twist it into useful shapes. If you blight a fruit, you might be able to have it ferment as it rots. If you blight a harvest, you could have the stems and bran disintegrate to dust to be blown away, leaving just the grain ready to be milled without threshing. This would lead to blight mages being very useful in industry, and there could be some fun thematic links between the insatiability of the magic and of the industries it supports.

As for the blight biosphere, I'd be tempted to instead have blight magic be so ruinous that it forces the local ecology to start from scratch with pioneer species like lichen that don't need soil. If an area sees regular blighting, the lichen will be common and the process won't take too long, but if you blight an area of old growth where the pioneer species have been outcompeted by successor species for miles around, you could have an eerie rocky clearing persist for centuries.

*Wild magic:* Cultivation magic obviously encourages a static existence, while blight magic has to constantly seek fresh biomass as its demands grow. What about if wild magic exists between the two, as something that entails a long-term nomadic existence?

Perhaps they could link themselves to trees and other plants, like dryads. They could gain sustenance and strength from each link based on the health of the plant, perhaps even agelessness. If links are easy to create but provide little benefit individually, that would encourage both a roaming existence to establish as many links as possible and optimising the health of each plant. If the number of links a plant can sustain is limited, that would limit the size of wild mage groups. Lastly, if there's a baseline level of health or biomass below which the link becomes harmful for the mage, that means they would focus on old growth trees and be unable to survive in less mature ecosystems.

In terms of their ecological role, I'm envisaging wild mages as something like apex predators. They benefit the biosphere by helping the plants past local optima, clearing trees of parasitic species and so on, because they benefit from the maximal energy use.

I think these factors would lead to wild mages being feral ageless loners roaming the deep forests, caring for the trees but striking at intruders or other wild mages with super strength and endurance. If their nomadic circuits last on the scale of decades or centuries, they would seem unpredictable to the shorter-lived merchants and travellers of the cities.

**** Great stuff. My current thinking is that a cultivation mage has a carefully structured feng shui garden where individual selectively bred and crafted plants feed magical energy into each other through in complicated arrangements that eventually lead to that energy being connected to the mage, who can use it out in the world. I suppose my mind is going to circuit board designs or efficient algorithm solving, where the cultivation mage is attempting to pack as many plants as efficiently as possible in one area while maintaining their links to each other and sculpting trees/bushes for maximum throughput or generation. Prehensile vines on the back are then just a useful application of that energy.

(The gardens and plants of the cultivation mage should be immaculately manicured, taking some inspiration from bonsai, but on a larger scale and more detail, aesthetic mostly because the energy pathways encourage symmetry and elaborate, emergent patterns.)

*** Blight mages would make surprisingly good doctors. A good blight mage can sterilise /anything/, including an infection - and that would be a fairly simple spell for them (the only tricky part is limiting the sterilization to the infection and not, say, nuking the patient's symbiotic gut bacteria at the same time).

*** Cultivation sounded like it'd be more territorial, while Wild sounded like it could be a source for more than one person, with the caveat that Wild relies on things that grow slower, so they'd be more protective.

Other magic: would this still be plant based?
