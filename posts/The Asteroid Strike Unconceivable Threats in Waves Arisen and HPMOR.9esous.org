Imagine being a dinosaur. You're chilling, eating grass, laying eggs, standing upright, whatever. Suddenly, an asteroid strikes Mexico, and you and everyone you know are dead.

This event, of extreme importance, had /nothing/ to do with /anything/ else that happened in your life. Not your choices, nor the choices of others so far as you could see, nor anything in the cosmic harmony of the universe that you were aware of called for such an event. It was a black swan, so to speak, or even more so: There was no sense in which a triceratops could have placed even an extremely low probability on an asteroid strike; “asteroid strike” was /not part of the hypothesis space/.

Imagine reading prophetic dinosaur literature, perhaps some fanfiction jotted out by the local equivalent of a Cassandra. It's all well and good, standard fantasy stuff of a Chosen One completing their Destiny and facing off against the Bad Guys. Until chapter seven, when the Chosen One's training in the ancient Dino Ruins to master the Super Duper Sword is interrupted by an asteroid strike that kills everyone.

It would be kind of shit. It obviates everything that came before it, anything already written in chapters 1-6 and, just as importantly, the /promise/ of chapters 7-12 (plus the two sequels, and the spinoff prequels, and the movies, and the toy line and the surprisingly decent video game), are wiped of all significance. /You're not supposed to do that when you write./

But in light of how dinosaurs /actually died/, there's clearly an important message contained in this type of story. The challenge is in expressing it in a way that doesn't make the reader hurl their copy into the bin.

Which brings me to two of my favorite fanfictions, /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ and /Waves Arisen/. The former was written by “Lesswrong,” aka Eliezer Yudkowsky, and the latter was written by SOME GUY who /might/ be Eliezer Yudkowsky or might just be someone exactly /like/ Eliezer Yudkowsky, WE CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW. Despite the potentially differing authors (snigger), these stories share common themes. In particular, they both fictionalize the Asteroid Strike.

(This essay contains complete spoilers for both of the above stories. In particular, if you haven't read [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][/Waves Arisen/]], I highly recommend you do so before reading this essay.)

/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/, or HPMOR, tells the story of an idiot who becomes ontologically incapable of being an idiot thanks to the magical intervention of a sociopathic, snakeghostmonster version of himself. HPMOR has an unusual structure, and never is it more unusual than in its last arc. Over the course of a lengthy and arduous journey to get the Philosopher's Stone and resurrect Hermione, it is revealed that the entire life(s) of Tom Riddle has been one giant Asteroid Strike. Of relatively minor significance, we find out that Voldemort has been at Hogwarts the entire time, manipulating the students and teachers around him to engineer a situation to acquire immortality and, presumably, power enough to conquer the world, which Harry did nothing whatsoever to resist or even /notice/. But this isn't really an Asteroid, because it was /conceivable/, even likely, that the Defense Professor was evil, as Hermione often pointed out. Moody even suspected him of being an outright Dark Wizard that was only pretending to be the Defense Professor. (When in fact he was a Dark Wizard pretending to be a Light Wizard pretending to be a Defense Professor---and even pretended to one Auror that he was a Light Wizard pretending to be a Dark Wizard pretending to be a Defense Professor, making him a Dark Wizard pretending to be a Light Wizard pretending to be a Dark Wizard pretending to be a Defense Professor. And since he honestly /was/ trying to teach Battle Magic to raise up valuable wizards under him, he was a Dark Wizard pretending to be a Light Wizard pretending to be a Dark Wizard pretending to be a Defense Professor, /while actually being a Defense Professor/.)

("Does the Dark Lord really use this many levels of meta in his plans?"

"Son, do my balls itch when it rains?" Moody asked. /Ah, so you have the Itchy Balls of Time/, thought Harry, while he put on the face of a naive and slightly perturbed eleven-year-old.)

("The word 'pretending' has stopped meaning anything to me," said Albus Dumbledore, averting nineteen ways in which the world could be destroyed. Then he ate a shoe.)

(Severus Snape quietly looked up all academic articles that mentioned "justified true belief" and had them destroyed.)

(Minerva took some more of the Muggle pills Harry had recommended.)

(Hermione was doing her homework and not reading any silly essays on the Internet until she was done.)

No, a teacher being Voldemort was the normal, literary event. (It literally happened in normal, albeit excellent, literature.) The real asteroid strike comes in chapter 88 when Voldemort finds out that Harry is going to destroy the universe.

Voldemort says that the degree to which Harry can shatter the world and thus threaten his immortality was something he thought impossible. The Pioneer Horcrux was meant to be his failsafe against any possible disaster still achievable by wizardkind in the aftermath of Merlin's Great Copyright.

Harry thinks a lot in literary terms, and while some of that comes from his obsession with books, Voldemort (in the guise of Quirrell) also often speaks in literary terms---he is very much aware of the tropes and how others reason as if they live in a book. We know Voldemort is a collector of old texts and legends in the quest for power, and one can surmise that some of Harry's appreciation for literature comes from Voldemort's influence---I think it would be /hard/ for someone who didn't like books to acquire power in the HPMOR world. Voldemort, no doubt, has some view of the world in literary terms---he certainly found it entertaining, for example, to play the role of the Dark Lord, and apparently expected to find it entertaining to play the role of the Hero.

Voldemort's self-story of the Hero crusading against (his own) death and (everyone else's) idiocy are shattered by a prophecy that makes his entire life's quest seem utterly inconsequential.

And we realize something that would have made both Tom Riddles squirm:

/Time never cared about Tom Riddle./

/It cares a lot about the sixteen year old Muggleborn with a wand and a physics textbook, idly Transfiguring something on a whim---/

/---who lives in New Zealand, has mediocre grades, has a personality that, if it were a food, would be best compared to oatmeal but with less flavor---/

/---has a crush on Sally Goatfucker or whatever people are named in New Zealand---/

/---who is totally, completely uninteresting, who can't even be killed with the Killing Curse 2.0 because being indifferent to his existence is like dividing by zero---/

/---who has no place in stories, no place in prophecies, no place in the same literary universe with someone as interesting, as ambitious, as dynamic, cool, and awesome as either Tom Riddle---/

/---who is more important than both of them, and Merlin, and the Founders of Hogwarts, and literally every life-form that has ever existed in this universe and any others he may inadvertently destroy---/

/---because he is an asteroid, and the universe does not care about what black swans your hypothesis space can conceive of, it will blow you up because the Rules have you scheduled to be blown up, and you have failed the Pachinko Game of Life---/

Voldemort was just another tyrant, another dictator who would have killed and made miserable a lot of people until being overthrown. (Though, he might have found it amusing to dramatically improve Britain and the world, just to prove a point.) Harry even thinks about this explicitly when contemplating what to do with the unconscious Voldemort: in the grand scheme of things, Voldemort did not stand out in history. Just another murderer, another broken life---until his final act in binding Harry's volition, Voldemort certainly had less impact on the world than Hitler, or Genghis Khan, or even someone like William the Conqueror, or any of the other historical unworthies of Time's attention.

(Though most stories have the Evil King being the focus of Time. Because to even think of the Asteroid Strike story, you have to conceive of an asteroid, and that is hard when you are a dinosaur. And so what could be the most significant negative outcome but for the Tyrannosaurus to rule everything in his tiny, hilarious fist?)

Voldemort was mostly normal, for all his evil, for all his power, and if his intelligence was exceptional, well, so is the way my feet smell if I don't put a cream on them. But this is not a thing the prophets speak of except to say, "Please put some socks on."

And so even Voldemort came very close to earning a grade of "Meets Expectations" in only Battle Magic class that ever mattered.

("I, I have to do this," the Headmaster explained gravely to Minerva, as he balanced on one leg while pouring tea into his hat, "you know not what lies in the balance," and Minerva turned to the door, lips trembling slightly, and deciding that she needed a break from Hogwarts, perhaps she would take an excursion to greet and help the next Muggleborn on their 11th birthday instead of having Hagrid do it as usual---)

Voldemort gets hit by an asteroid, the out-of-nowhere event that, without warning, without sign, is suddenly HERE, presenting an existential threat. And the rest of the wizarding world gets hit by the fallout only a short while later. In the aftermath of how Voldemort prevents the end of the world, Harry has FOOMed, going from a mere first-year student to a wielder of several powerful magical artifacts and having as Chief Morality Advisor a heroine with skill ranks in Being Immortal and the Bazooka Mastery feat. This happens over the course of...an hour? To the rest of the world, this occurrence is just, like, absurd. Like, life is just normal, and then BAM! HARRY POTTER! AZKABAN'S GONE! EVERYONE LIVES FOREVER NOW!

And yet at no point does anything weird happen. Voldemort and Harry fight, Harry wins, takes Voldemort's loot, and puts Hermione in the active party. Thus, he is now A Really Big Deal. /There was no break from the natural course of events that Voldemort led them on, which did not seem to be leading to FOOM/---and yet if you were a person in the world of HPMOR, it would feel like the world had just flipped upside-down in a completely incomprehensible way.

The "FOOM" scenario sounds mysterious, and maybe even stupid---until you walk through it from the perspective of the one who is FOOMing, in which case it feels totally normal and not even particularly rapid or jarring, until you reflect back and realize you accidentally conquered the world when you were eleven. (By virtue of being an idiot, too---Voldemort basically ends up handing Harry immense power in the form of the Stone and a Trollmionicorn, because of the way in which Harry maneuvers himself into Voldemort's power and moreover, would have otherwise destroyed the world in his carelessness and rationalizing. Thus also showing the idea that, mostly, FOOM destroys the world, and only through great and particular efforts can that be averted. This isn't a /real-world argument/, it's a method of /sharing the internal experience of a particular belief or set of beliefs,/ letting you feel the algorithm from the inside; the piggies from Speaker for the Dead do not exist, but I know what it is like to be one more than I know what it is like to be, say, a Ukrainian person.)

Waves Arisen takes the Asteroid Strike much further than HPMOR.

If the Asteroid Strike is literary unfairness in-universe (/diabolus ex machina/, as Harry calls it), then Waves Arisen is brutally unfair to its main character---and to any readers expecting the story to grant Naruto certain privileges that are standard to protagonists. These privileges are things like extraordinary luck, unnatural wit, and a tendency for mysteries to be resolved, probability be damned. Waves Arisen does grant Naruto the anthropic fortune that nearly any story requires, and allows most of its scenes to have better comedic and dramatic timing than would ever likely occur in reality, but it does /not/ answer many of the mysteries in Naruto's life. Who killed the Hokage? Who killed Kakashi and Guy, and why? What was Sai up to? What was Kabuto thinking? Why do I have to know topology to read a fucking Naruto fanfiction?

(The story gives plausible answers to all these questions but doesn't tell you outright---thus showing the best way to write a mystery is to just write the plain reality as the viewpoint character observes it and then /not spell out the answer/.)

Harry experiences what it's like to face a foe not bound by narrative constraints when his efforts to protect Hermione are invalidated by a smarter, stronger foe who doesn't acknowledge the camera and therefore has no qualms about rendering her defenseless off-screen. Naruto is struck by a number of tragedies he can do nothing to prevent. He has no warning, and the consequences are already permanent by the time he has any information of the event---most noticeably, Kakashi's death.

If Harry has to deal with an Asteroid Strike, then Naruto faces the Asteroid Field---and without the supernaturally lucky Han Solo to navigate it, he's struck a number of times.

The Asteroid Field works beautifully in a ninja story. A ninja world is inherently one of uncertainty and imperfect information, with plots within plots concealed behind masks that are smiling faces. Amid such a storm of varying ignorance and conflicting intentions, a ninja has to observe, evaluate, and act /without sufficient prior knowledge or ex post confirmation or denial/. This is most clear in what is probably the most ninja-ish scene I have ever read, in which Naruto speculates that Sai might be trying to kill them, finds a secret way to communicate this to Sasuke, and Sasuke then decides to kill Sai without even informing Naruto of his intention. Neither Naruto nor Sasuke had sufficient information to justify an execution, nor could either be certain of a successful execution, and they never find out if their actions were in fact correct. Nevertheless, while they did not have sufficient information to justify killing someone, within a ninja context one could also say that they did not have sufficient information to justify /not/ killing someone. And it is in that space of uncertainty of goals, abilities, and outcomes that a ninja tale is at its most exciting. ("We might be sent to our deaths with a mission as the pretense," is not something Naruto considers prior to finding himself in the middle of exactly that scenario.)

And of course, if Naruto gets struck by a number of asteroids, then at the end of the story the ninja world basically wakes up one day to see a mega-asteroid hurtling toward them with “I DID THE DINOSAURS AND NOW I'M BACK FOR THE REST OF YOU FUCKERS” written on its Earth-facing surface. Naruto has FOOMed, and has come to reform the ninja world with...a deluge of cheap Japanese electronics, thus drawing an analogy between globalization of the world order and the resulting “superstar” economy that rewards intense specialization and talent at the expense of the average laborer, which is seen in how Naruto alone is more productive than ten thousand regular ninjas. Hinata is Hillary Clinton, unable to express herself honestly, which leaves her future uncertain, and Sasuke is George Bush, an idiot on a crusade who also happens to be hysterically funny to watch.

(I got an A in literary analysis in school. Well, I got an F, but I interpreted it as an A.)

(I also got an F in topology and tried interpreting that as an A. It didn't work.)

(And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the difference between the humanities and the sciences. ...I also got an F in philosophy, but that's just because I never went to class.)

We walk with Naruto through his FOOMing just as we do with Harry's. Naruto is actually in control of his, but it still happens by accident. Through sheer coincidence, a couple of techniques he learns plus an inborn demon advantage gives him access to infinite chakra, near-immortality, super-fast learning techniques, near omnipresence, and lots of cheap, cheap manual labor. Never do the normal rules of the ninja world break apart, nor is there any great external shock or conceptual leap forward. Instead, just putting a few already-known parts together results in pseudo-omnipotence, just because they happen to do that when put together that way. It's plausible why this has never happened before---the requirements are demon fox plus the protected shadow clone technique plus water element affinity plus, I think, sage mode---but all of these are known. In principle, anyone could have theorycrafted FOOM in this regard---and were Naruto a tabletop game, it would have taken the players about a week. Yet it's clear why no one has even theorycrafted this. For one, no one has bothered to do rudimentary scientific activity with respect to chakra and ninjutsu, which is very plausible looking at human history. Moreover, no one is thinking about this stuff; everyone is focused on survival and politics and immediate, relatively small-potatoes struggles for power; no one has the ninja equivalent of the Sequences to broaden their horizons and expand their mind.

So it's clear why this has never happened before or been thought about. Yet it's also clear from the natural and plausible road that Naruto walks on the path to becoming God that the ninja world has absolutely no protection against this happening other than its prior unlikeliness. The ninja world has no laser defense system to protect against asteroids; they are still in the primitive mode of mostly never thinking about the problem while counting on pure luck to see them through. /Unlike us./

If Naruto were evil instead of good, and there is nothing about the process of taking measurements on chakra and learning water clone and sage techniques that requires or creates goodness, then MegaSatanHitler would have conquered the world because people were too busy rooting for Team Leaf or Team Stone to notice just how exposed and fragile their weak and ignorant world really was.

/Unlike us./

The ninjas worship television. /Unlike us./

You shouldn't believe anything because a fictional story made it sound plausible. In fact, there's an [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rHBdcHGLJ7KvLJQPk/the-logical-fallacy-of-generalization-from-fictional][essay]] about it, which wertifloke can neither confirm nor deny he authored. But you should /believe in the possibility of believing in it/. You should be able, if the story was successful, to "get it." After reading HPMOR, I can or think I can put myself in Yudkowsky's head to some degree when he thinks of FOOM, the mundane processes he pictures when he imagines it happening, and +OH FUCK ROBIN HANSON IS VOLDEMORT+

At the risk of delving into an interminable and pointless but pleasantly distracting discussion on What Rational Fiction Really Is, the Asteroid Strike stands out to me as the clearest way in which HPMOR's structure diverges from standard literature in a manner that is particularly conducive to rational fiction. I'm not saying that you should all put Asteroid Strikes in your stories. But you definitely should.

But I'm not telling you to but do it.

(And don't go too far with it---the rationalfic /inversion/ of the Asteroid Strike happens in the forest when Naruto and his team wait in ambush for another ninja team. The ambush goes off without a hitch, they get the scroll, and head on their way. Naruto even reflects on how this isn't surprising: a well-laid plain ought to work, that's the whole of planning. Just as the villain will try to Asteroid Strike the heroes, the heroes will also try to win with Asteroid Strikes too, which is just a metaphor for a strategy that the opponent can't interact with in any way before it defeats them. Since everyone wants to win non-interactively, the challenge is in either constructing a scenario in which interaction nevertheless happens or in writing through the non-interactivity, as both HPMOR and Waves Arisen do, albeit in different ways.)

In conclu/boom/


** Now and then I'm accused of having written something that doesn't appear under my name, and sometimes in one of those cases somebody talks about "Eliezer's style". There is much in this world that I cannot confirm or deny, but I'll at least say this much: I did at least once go and write a piece of online fiction to test my writing skills, not under my own name. This work isn't what you could call prominent, but it is sometimes casually mentioned in somebody's "Best Of" list. To the best of my knowledge nobody has ever accused Eliezer Yudkowsky of having written it. Because I tried to write in a different style, and so far as I know, it totally worked.

Nobody responding to this message will mention the work in question either, unless somebody throws out an enormous shotgun list - say, a list so long as to contain at least 9 other works. The writing didn't especially sound like Eliezer, or rather didn't sound like you imagine Eliezer to be; so you didn't notice.

(Of course I could be wrong about that, in which case I will privately be very impressed that you called it; but needless to say I shall not confirm nor deny.)

It is also the case that I've at least once been falsely accused by more than one accuser of having written an online fiction piece to which I in fact made no contribution at all, not even beta reading or advice about plot or dialogue adjustments. Authors sometimes try to do the same things I tried to do in HPMOR, and then somebody thinks that's *Eliezer's style* instead of a particular set of writing goals... so it goes.

** I frankly disagree with anything in HPMOR being an "asteroid strike". HPMOR followed very much narrative convention in its core structure: it had a hero, a villain, a challenge, foreshadowing galore, a final reckoning. While the way we get there is very different, the fundamental structure isn't all that different from the original HP books: Harry and Voldemort are fated enemies, linked one to each other, and in the end one /has/ to defeat the other - and he does. That's not an asteroid. Neither are the concerns about Harry destroying the universe, which are mostly a plot device, and potentially sequel fuel.

It would have been an asteroid strike if Harry had /actually/ inadvertently brought forth the collapse of a metastable void state with his partial transmutation experiments, thus obliterating the Earth and producing a lightspeed expanding bubble of annihilation, and leaving all plot threads midway through.

I agree that this would be an interesting way to end a story. Hard to make it not feel a blatant troll, and perhaps it would be more fit for a short story than a novel-sized one, where the investment of the reader would grow a lot before being frustrated so blatantly, which would make the whole experience just really unpleasant.

BTW, it's not exactly rational, but this reminds me of /Inuyashiki/. A superhero manga where [[#s][Inuyashiki ending spoilers]].

It might work as a "quest upgrade" if you frame it right, but coupled with that Voldemort lost...

****** It certainly was an event that changed the direction of the story, but those aren't unheard of in stories. No one died and no previous buildup had to be radically discarded; they only had to revise their objectives. By comparison, even the [[#s][GoT spoilers]] is a much bigger upset.

The "asteroid-like" event would be something that completely runs counter any narrative wisdom. Something where for example a long time spent to build up a character and the reader's affection towards them is willingly thrown out of the window because of a completely random occurrence unrelated to anything else happening in the plot. Like, dunno, the Hogwarts Express crashes from one of those very tall bridges due to a structural failure. Everyone dies at the beginning of Year 2. The rest of the story is the professors dealing with guilt and grief. Also, Voldemort is now unopposed and triumphs. End of HP.

Stuff like this isn't usually /done/ in stories because it would just sort of ruin their point. It would make them empty, purposeless, meaningless. Like, y'know, real life. But exactly for that reason it would also be interesting to see it happen, sometimes. It's definitely nothing like the Voldie thing though. First and foremost, a true "asteroid-like" event would be /enraging as fuck/. Like, you could see the cleverness afterwards, but the first reaction of any invested reader should probably be to just slam the book against the wall.

***** I thought it was about how the prophecy was an Asteroid to Voldemort. Not a perfect one, mind you, because he would have known prophecies existed, but still an Asteroid, since they still seem really rare in-universe.

Voldemort was going about his life, on his own personal mission, just kind of mucking about here and there, killing a few idiots, maybe planning to take over a government or two. Nothing special. Nothing that hadn't happened a thousand times before him, and would continue to happen long after he had died. He was like a T-Rex, hunting and killing and, while limited, still essentially the master of their own destiny.

And then the Prophecy happened, and nothing else mattered. Nothing else was important, because this was Happening now. There was nothing he could have done to avoid it. There was nothing he could have done to predict it. And once it happened, there was nothing he could do to escape it. From Voldemort's point of view, the Prophecy being made was like an Asteroid; a sudden, incredibly impactful event that cannot be combated, avoided, or even predicted.

All the events of HPMOR are just Voldemort trying to fight the Asteroid, and failing; proving once and for all just how futile it all was. He was like a T-Rex, roaring at the Big Rock. Powerful and terrible in his own way, but ultimately irrelevant in the face of such overwhelming force.

The revelation that everything dumbledore has done was in response to this prophecy, that Harry's very existance was shaped by it, is a pretty major and startling revelation.

But, I get what you mean; as readers we are brought along for the ride in a smooth manner. it lacks the shock value of something like the Red Wedding; and a "real" asteroid strike should be even worse than that. It should be the white walkers sweeping down unannounced to devour westeros in the midst of its political bickering.

But having no foreshadowing whatsoever is dissatisfying to the reader, and the POINT of the asteroid strike can be made even while it is worked into the narrative in an acceptable way. That is, the reader can be made to understand the pettiness or short sightedness of the human characters' squabbles in the face of an uncaring, overwhelming natural force -- but this doesn't mean you have to forgo foreshadowing necessarily to address those themes. The shock value is a stylistic choice, not about content.

****** I don't know, I feel like the point would be exactly to be unexpected, even at the cost of it being frustrating.

I'll make an example that's basically the exact opposite trope. I read a novel once, "The Desert of the Tartars" (also translated as "The Tartar steppe") by Dino Buzzati. The novel is about one officer who moves to a border outpost in a god-forsaken place, serving as a guarding post against possible invasions by these roaming barbarians, the Tartars. The guy goes on with his life in this place, small accident happens, and there's always an atmosphere of /tension/ - like the Tartars are going to attack at any moment, and things will get dramatic.

And then they never do. Or rather, they do at the very end, when the protagonist is old and ailing and dies in his bed without even getting to see them.

Reading that novel felt... incredibly frustrating. It wasn't a /pleasant/ read. But at the same time, through the unpleasantness, it delivered its message (about basically the pointlessness of wasting your life in wait of grand events that may never come to pass, or in service of bogus causes) extremely well. So a similar thing I could see for a "true" asteroid story. It wouldn't be a fun read, but it still could be powerful.

You are talking about the stylistic impression or feeling the reader should get when you imagine the impact of an asteroid, or the anticipation of it.

That feeling could happen regardless of the subject matter or content.

HPMOR has a little bit of that feeling but since Voldie=Defense professor is so telegraphed from the original series and the prophecy is somewhat distant and vague, it doesn't have the /emotional impact/ that you imagine being associated with an asteroid.

The OP is saying this sense of surprise WOULD be felt by other characters in the story - such as the students at hogwarts experiencing Harry's "foom", or voldemort being surprised by his defeat twice at the peak of his power. But the reader doesn't experience this.

My interpretation of an Asteroid strike is more of "inevitable and catastrophic events beyond the scope of human control". This can be done in a variety of styles, and is more about thematic content.

all of these can be present in any combination, or not, in a given story.

By the time a protagonist breaks the world, I have already lost interest. Sometimes the story is good enough on its own merits that I'll keep reading anyway, but sometimes it isn't. HPMOR was at its best, for me, when it pointed out aspects of the world of Harry Potter that weren't particularly well thought out. The last arc you loved so much was the one that well and truly lost me. I'd been wanting to see how the story ended for a long time by that point, and I was /profoundly/ disappointed.

I can't even remember the point at which I got tired of The Waves Arisen. I had wiped whatever I had read from memory so thoroughly that I went to check up on it and recognized the map. Reading the first chapter brought back enough that I don't have to read any more.

To explore my frustration without resorting to fiction: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalExams/][Final Exams]]

A particular selection of HPMOR fans were so proud of their ability to save Harry at the end that they thought they were so /unlike/ the ninjas that they would apply the same brainstorming process to such oncoming asteroids as whether P=NP and the outcome of Israeli elections. It didn't last long.

One can know all the rules of The Wizarding World easier than one can know all the rules of emergency room efficiency. Because the rules of the former were made by one person - in the case of fanfiction, two - and the rules of the latter are deliberately confounded by a bazillion of them, hungrily exploiting loopholes to their advantages and then closing those loopholes and opening others.

The world we live in is the result of thousands of years of such scheming. People more clever and better informed than Big Yud on any and every particular subject have been beating their collective heads against the Greatest Problems since before anybody knew what time it was. They continue to.

They are inspired to "shut up and do the impossible" and, as you say, the fact that they believe they /might/ do the impossible is what keeps the world turning. That and the conservation of angular momentum.

I want more deconstruction rational fiction, where it turns out that everybody else already did the thinking that our conventional protagonist might and witness the way that world looks /afterwards/... or, if authors want a real challenge, a deep reconstruction where we explore the hitherto unseen scaffolding that supports the way things are. The protagonist's successes are smaller, more focused, and less likely to destroy the potential for sequels that match what we loved about the original.

Imagining that by strict application of first principles you might implement the FOOM isn't /rational/. Inspiring, sure, and more likely to bring about positive results than my cynicism, but it wouldn't be a smart bet. An asteroid strike isn't a black swan if you can see it coming.

I have very low expectations that EY is not actually smarter than the vast majority of people, even those trying to solve the Greatest Problems. This is not a statement about the limits or lack thereof of EY's current domain expertise, or current capabilities or skills or knowledge about any particular fields. I don't agree with everything EY says, and obviously think he would be even smarter and more clever if he could clone himself and learn all the things he doesn't know he doesn't know and then merge to integrate it all, same as anyone.

But if you've met many of the Serious People of the world and think they're remotely as actually-clever-and-sane-and-intelligent as EY, I'd love to meet the ones you're thinking of, because the ones I've met are marginally-smarter-than-average at best, and most have either lucked into wherever they're at or leveraged a particular set of expertise at a particularly opportune moment.

Like, there are a lot of super clever and intelligent people throughout history and the current world, and some are on EY's level and some are even higher, but this line just rubbed me the wrong way. It assumes a level of intelligence and cleverness that I have failed to see in most people who are in charge of institutions. I don't mean to imply there aren't /good reasons/ for that, or that many of the world's hard problems /really aren't as simple as depositing one EY into the equation would help solve,/ but I wouldn't rule that hypothesis out until it actually had a chance to be tested.

(This isn't as specific to EY as it sounds, btw, there are others in the rationality community and outside of it that I think are far cleverer than the majority of people in positions of power and prestige, and that's an important failure mode to pay attention to in considering why the world is in the state that it's in)

For example, a genius solution to global warming would be worthless without the political ability to get it accepted and espoused by the general populace (in fact, I would say this is a big problem science has had with GW and other topics: relying too much on scientists who want to do everything and are unwilling to engage fully with politics has led to piss-poor communication choices that have chipped away at its credibility, making anti-science instead a viable political position to simply harvest certain forms of discontent).

Ok, agreed. So let's put it this way - of course I can't /demonstrate/ something this vague (after all, it's not like we can even measure something like cleverness in an objective way). My general idea is, for any given field, there exists a compendium of accumulated knowledge through centuries or millennia of studies by reasonably brilliant people. It seems reasonable to assume such a compendium will be in general superior to the output of a single human, however brilliant they can be, because it constitutes the synthesis (through filtering and selection of ideas, in an evolution-like process) of the work of dozens and dozens of people probably similarly brilliant. Any specialist in a field spends a significant part of their life studying such compendia - significant enough that you simply wouldn't have enough time in your life to get the same level of expertise in /two/ separate fields. So basically, any specialist will probably be only really good at /one/ thing, no matter how clever they are. For any other things, they still can contribute valuable opinions and viewpoints - even occasionally with the benefit of outsider perspective - but they'll also probably have a lots of blind spots, unknown unknowns, and suffer a bit from Dunning-Kruger syndrome. Applying one's own expertise to tackle a completely different field is [[https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/here_to_help.png][very tempting]], but more often than not only seems like a good idea because you're just /that/ ignorant.

Of course there's actual powerful interests. That's the point, that's why you need to be a good politician to push this stuff. There's /always/ powerful interests. Expecting that all you need to do is spell out the truth and it'll magically stick is naive. To anyone listening who doesn't have the first hand evidence that you do, it's no more truth than what someone else says - it's just a matter of /who do they trust more/. Of course GW is already a difficult narrative to sell to begin with (time scales beyond human scope, requires to go against social inertia, etc.) so it wasn't an easy task either way, but more political savviness could have probably helped. How exactly? I don't know, I'm a scientist myself so probably would have screwed it up as badly.

But I'm also really wary of anything that suggests that I should take at face value the idea that this thing that looks simple to crack /is/ actually that simple and everyone else is just too stuck in their own assumptions and can't think outside the box.

To make an example, I /do/ have a feeling that medicine suffers from some of these problems. Seen from the outside, a lot of the field seems stuffy, locked into practices and habits (especially in terms of how things are taught and learned) that seem more the product of its historical tradition than of sensible didactic practice. The gap between the state-of-the-art researchers and your common GP seems immense. It seems hardly believable that there could be /anything/ beyond simple gut-level decisions or optimism-biased assumptions going on when a doctor hears you describing a bunch of symptoms and rules out that it's just some trivial thing in three minutes without even touching you. I don't think there is, in fact. But the problem is also, while I do have these suspicions (and the right to express them, I think), every time I talked with people who actually /are/ doctors about them I always got the answer that basically the whole shebang is just such a convoluted fucking mess that these sort of heuristics are still the only effective way we seem to have to navigate them. Of course, one could argue, maybe they just say that /because they're doctors/; they've been trained a certain way and can't see beyond the habits and prejudices that have been drilled into them together with the knowledge. That can be true. But either way, I can't imagine any serious reform coming from anyone /but/ a doctor who still understands the knowledge sufficiently to realise what could be done to amend the way it's applied, because mine are just surface level feelings. There's too many things I ignore to actually make any kind of /constructive/ proposal.

And when EY for example makes the Bank of Japan example in his book (just started reading), he /does/ mention the opinion of professional economists. It's not something out of thin air. Rather, you get actual experts who don't have the sort of ties that will coax them into a socially-reinforced or biased position ("I don't want to criticise my senior colleagues, therefore I will not openly question their decisions even if I think they're wrong), and develop a contrarian opinion.

True, but note that building a cell lets you, in theory, chain together dozens of decisions that only pay off in combination. Evolution can't really do that, it can only retroengineer it by coincidence.

IMO for cells as we know it to be optimal, the efficiency ceiling has to be either low or reachable by many different paths, so that almost every beginning state can be moved into a near-optimal endstate by near-monotonous incremental improvement. Evolution never even hit the wheel; it certainly would never have hit the nuclear reactor. Such structural and systemic improvements that are so plentiful in the macro would have to be near-absent in the micro.

He even criticizes the scientific method for not focusing on testing out the most probable theories first, and basically accepting any theory no matter how unlikely to be worth tested before more statistically likely theories, while at the same time seeing this type of failure as good and productive.

EY says this makes it slower than it should be, and wastes resources. He says it's not an optimized system, it's just an inherited crude system we inherited from people from centuries ago, but we are too stuck in our ways to bother taking the time and effort necessary to fix it.

​

I believe he's mostly right on both cases. Evolution could, create the most effective methods for something like cell architecture given infinite time, I just find it unlikely to have happened already given it's low ability to go back and optimize designs that already work because this would risk a period of lower performance and to an extent make this sort of thing risky to the individuals and make said trait less common.

i.e if to optimize your eye evolution has to risk a high rate of blindness for a period, this trait will rarely be passed on, therefore your eye will not be optimized. If to improve or optimize anything in evolution involves any potential limited time downgrade evolution will actually make it more unlikely to happen.

Just as an FYI purple is a better color to absorb uv light, in fact most organisms that filled this niche were purple before the green ones showed up. The green ones won because their by product, oxygen, was toxic to it's competitors. In this case, for random reasons the less efficient method won evolutionary wise.

I think this involves another really deep rabbit hole, which is having a theory of how probable theories are. These sort of heuristics are very tricky. I cited earlier "Lost in Math", that looks exactly at how people in particle physics built up this notion of "naturalness" to discriminate likely from unlikely theories based simply on aesthetic criteria and the vague notion that it's sort of similar to the theories that worked until now. Even though it can be shown that in fact it's not really that way - rather, /our aesthetic sense/ about theories is now shaped by existing ones. So basically we're just looking for more stuff resembling what we already know, like people in the late XIX century were looking for the luminiferous aether because mechanical waves through material mediums was all they knew.

So yeah, not disagreeing that we would need to rethink our methods, especially in some fields. And I've never been very enthusiastic on Popper's notion of falsifiability, that while useful, sort of dumps the entire complexity of the induction problem into the "theory proposing" step, which becomes the really critical one for the /speed/ of scientific development. I'm just not sure a unique way to determine which theories are /more probable/ exists. Of course, in some cases it's obvious. If I meet a new phenomenon, I first try to explain it with existing models than with some novel never-heard-before energy-conservation-violating new quantum theory of matter.

  I'm just not sure a unique way to determine which theories are more probable exists. Of course, in some cases it's obvious. If I meet a new phenomenon, I first try to explain it with existing models than with some novel never-heard-before energy-conservation-violating new quantum theory of matter.

You are correct. But a lot of scientists get fixated on these more unlikely theories and waste time and resources, and when proven wrong they are told what they did was good and productive. He says he himself could have wasted a decade with this if he hadn't been lucky.

EY argues that you can find the most likely theories to work using Occam's razor / it's updated version Solomonoff induction..

He even has a series of articles criticizing how silly it was for our physicists to accept quantum collapse for as long as they did, while some physicists today still accept it. Even though it goes completely against Occam's razor.

********************** Heh, quantum collapse is an old pet peeve of mine... I'm reading right now a long book about the Solvay conference of 1927, which basically was the tipping point that made that idea prevail. An interesting (if technical) read on how much personal politics and circumstances can shift the course of science: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0609184][Quantum Theory at the Crossroads]]. I'm doing this in preparation for a talk I will give on some modern developments of pilot wave theory, so... you may imagine this is a topic close to my heart.

However, I think some freedom of pursuing even seemingly unlikely ideas is useful. Sometimes the unlikely idea can be a weird road to a great one. If you read the book, you'll find a lot of weird roads that were taken to get to modern QM - it's not like one day Schroedinger woke up and dreamed his equation into existence. The obsession with trying to maximise efficiency along the lines of only supporting the most sane-sounding research which seems to promise the safest returns is /exactly/ what has generated the modern publish or perish setup, and for all we know, could be a major contributor to the current dearth of breakthroughs physics is experiencing.

You are just making some assumptions about what can and cant be known about what true ai would be like ,but thats not something trivial that you can easily determine without actually trying to do basic research .

Maybe it turns out its not posible to do usefull research before we know how to make human level AGI .But we have reseach first to figure that out , you cant just decide that it looks like we can't.

Have you actually tried to figure out what kind of useful research could be done now before concluding that its imposible?

All fields have to start at some point.Ai safety its just a new one , that happened to start a bit more than ten years ago whith a few people that included Eliezer and the organization he founded.

At some point someone has to start doing basic research that no one has ever thought of doing for a field to start.But If what you want its authority and amount of scientists that agree, the field has been growing for years.

It never was literally only Eliezer anyway .But now other groups of people like Open ai are doing ai safety research .

Its difficult to judge what is going to be useful in the end.Even if his most important contribution ends just being getting a lot of people interested on the topic that still would mean that there was low hanging fruit to be had there .There were some actions that nobody was taking , no people more clever and better informed than" Big Yud" on any and every particular subject had been beating their head against this Greatest Problem before he did .And hes currently doing research that nobody else is doing and is not obiously wrong.I wouldn't be surprised if in future ai safety textbooks contain things Eliezer wrote.

You can have expertise in game theory statistics machine learning and all other related fields anyway.And on ehat people are doing in the field , what problems are open and what has been tried etc.

And the research is not mostly resoning by analogy right now .There is reasoning by analogy yes , but like there is concrete research to be done about formalizing things and Eliezer seems to be working on that so dunno.\\
If you mean about the forecasting stuff and that kind of thing maybe , but that seem to be mostly on the question of if ai safety is important in the first place ,and seeing how deep mind is hiring ai safety researchers i would say the consensus is slowly moving towards that.Of course if you rely on big consensus as an heuristic to believe things or not you are not going to be convinced yet.And its not that its a bad heuristic , but then you are not going to be able to judge new things whith few researchers on them, only the obviously true stuff, and sometimes yo will still be wrong.If you want we can discuss in more detail what things you think are likely to be true , what things you think we cant know now and how likely it is that other day(now I'm a bit sleepy and I'm not sure how coherent this will look tomorrow so I'll just turn off my phone and go sleep)

I feel like you've missed my cruxes, if you think the things you're saying in this post are things I disagree with or are arguing against. The main point I'm making is that assuming that "there are experts in other fields who are more knowledgeable about those fields than EY" is not the same thing as them being more clever, and while ultimately EY will never be able to accumulate as much knowledge in multiple fields as he will on his major focuses, one of them being rationality is actually far more useful to such cross-domain analysis and problem solving than practically any other domain expertise.

It doesn't automatically make him /right/ or /knowledgeable/ or anything like that when talking about other fields.

Honestly, I've been reading "Inadequate Equilibria" now (approximately 60% in, thanks for the link!) and I feel like what he's saying comes across a bit better to me because it sounds like a more measured claim. He never puts things in terms of "X is more clever than Y". In fact, in almost all his dialogues, "people are stupid" is Simplicio's argument. He talks about systemic failures that happen /regardless of how clever the people involved are/. In fact, if you have a broken enough system of incentives, the rational people who are however looking out mostly for themselves might just run with it better than the others. A very good rational scientist might be /amazing/ at putting out high impact factor publishable papers and still not produce great science - because they'd just have optimised the ability the system they're in is /really/ selecting for.

I don't have a problem with believing this sort of thing. My mom isn't a rationalist of any sort, and she actually sometimes pulled off better diagnoses than our family doctor for me when I was a child using information available to amateurs, in a time in which we didn't even have the internet.

I agree with EY's arguments on "modest epistemology" and how it can fail. It is a topic in fact dear to me and that I see discussed a lot in my bubble in some of its specific realisations (for example, there's a certain doctor in Italy who has built a fame out of heavily criticising the anti-vaxxer movement but has soon transformed from an educator into an arrogant prick who positively touts and promotes a universal Argument from Authority - basically arguing that if you don't have a degree in medicine all you should ever do is shut up and listen to your betters. This obviously is largely seen as a very stupid and harmful approach by sane people, as it effectively harms the overall credibility of medicine even more when it does happen to actually fuck up). I guess what I don't appreciate in your way of framing this is that I think you're giving too much credit to EY's /skill/ and less to his /position/ as someone who simply had different incentives. For example, the SAD thing didn't require being especially clever. It just required $600 dollars. A child could have come up with the same idea. The reason why medical science did not test for it has nothing to do with the lack of clever people.

Still feels like a massive missing of the point. Most people with SAD have $600 dollars or more. Furthermore, "a child could have come up with X" is honestly one of the most insulting ways to dismiss something someone cleverer than you managed to do, just because it seems simple in retrospect. It's not /always/ about cleverness, as you point out, position and incentives are important too, but unless you've done something similarly impressive along the same axis, there are a million people sitting in armchairs happy to gab about how /they/ could have come up with that or how they had the /same idea/ as that writer or director or inventor or entrepreneur or whatever, but somehow it's still just one person who was the first to make the thing and a million of them who were nowhere near actually doing so.

So to me, the reason why medical science didn't test for it has /exactly/ to do with a lack of clever people, if "clever" is being used in the same way I use it to describe high level rationalists. I mean I wasn't the first one to use the word "clever" for that, I'd rather just say "rational" when in a community that I hope would know what I mean when I use that word.

I'm just saying "clever" is the wrong axis. It's insulting to suggest that all those people lack the intelligence to deduce that if "some light" is helpful, then "more light" is even more helpful. In fact, a more clever person could know more about non-linear functions and start making up excellent rationalizations for why that might not be the case. I am confident that EY would back me up on this. Rather, it makes far more sense to think that everyone is falling prey to the $20 note fallacy: if it's been on the ground for so long, /it must be fake/. EY wasn't the only one clever enough to try it. He was the only one who actually shrugged and went "why the hell not" (the only one /that we know of/, I might add; maybe other people did similar things and didn't document it. And we'd still need to replicate his findings in a more controlled study to confirm it isn't just placebo or some unrelated effect that did the trick). Which is in itself a quality, but it's not "cleverness". More, like... willingness to break the mold? Unconventional-ness? Resistance to peer pressure? It's a social intelligence thing, not a smarts thing, though it often happens that science-smart people /also/ possess this trait. In fact it's a trait that might be /disadvantageous/ in some contexts. So EY may be able to use it positively to help his girlfriend with her SAD, but he also might be affected negatively by it when he comes off as too smug or self-assured to others, because going along with the majority is a powerful bonding mechanism important to social trust. It's why utilitarianism isn't quite as popular as virtue ethics.

I'm not saying that EY is not clever either, of course. Just that this specifically wasn't one situation where that aspect was the prominent one.

The idea of "high level rationalists" in general also just irks me. It feels like simply sliding back in basic primate mode: find a pack leader, someone to respect and admire, and defer to them. That's the surefire way to creating new problems instead of fixing old ones. Everyone has skills that can be useful, but no one is fundamentally smarter than the problems that we are all victims of, nor the problems themselves exist for want of intelligence. Simple random occurrences can push crowds of rational, intelligent actors into toxic equilibria that will then become unbreakable. It's no one's fault and it's got nothing to do with how stupid or smart the people involved in it are. It could be broken thanks to someone incredibly smart or someone incredibly stupid, on purpose or not, as well. It's a natural feature of complex systems. It's a phenomenon we need to study, prepare for and mitigate, collectively, just as we do with earthquakes.

[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/09/16/is-iq-a-predictor-of-success/#2286d0063604]]

Specifically, sure, IQ correlates with certain outcomes. However IQ is a metric that attempts to measure intelligence, but specifically, it gauges /certain skills/ (I've never taken one of the professional tests it mentions there but I suppose it's usually spatial, verbal manipulation, etc.). So it's more like a metric of a subset of specific skills that can have real-life applications. In addition, correlation =/= causation, so of course there's a whole other host of possible failure points there. For example you could argue that IQ-related skills are "signallers", things that our specific society takes as representative of good intelligence and therefore will lead you to be hired more, get more promotions etc. regardless of whether those things /actually/ contribute to what you're doing.

What I mean is, there's lots of trappings in trying to capture something as general as intelligence. Even if you define intelligence as that one thing that helps you achieve success regardless of the circumstances (and that's already damn vague), then you have the problem of defining success itself. If people with higher IQ get jobs that pay more, for example, does that mean success? Someone could argue "but people with high IQ are also on average more depressed and suffer more from various forms of mental illness, so /surely/ that's a sign their lives are actually worse!" and that success is to /not/ suffer from depression, something that IQ does not help with.

In other words, I find philosophically much less troublesome to simply talk about differences in skill on specific field. Sure, there is a quality people possess that makes sense to call "intelligence" and that usually manifests itself as a high level of skill in a number of different but usually contiguous fields (note: not necessarily /the same/ fields, since different types of intelligence exist; a very intelligent politician or lawyer couldn't do a scientist's job, nor the scientist could do the politician's). But I still think the best way to think about it is through the ways in which it manifests itself, rather than the unknown quantity itself. And I don't particularly think we'd benefit much in practice from a good way to measure it. Almost all of our problems come less from a lack of understanding of "who's better than who" and more from a lack of agreement on what "better" even /means/.

And there's certainly a ready motivator of "it's unfair some people are just innately better able to reason in general and there's no way to change that". However when it comes down to it and you need to pick one of two people to do something that is crucially important gets done well and all you know about the candidates is that one has IQ two standard deviations above mean and the other two deviations below? Vague philosophical arguments don't give much of a way out there, you just pick the person more likely to succeed, i.e. the one with the higher one.

Certainly if the task is narrow and concrete and you have data about performance of people on that exact task, you pick the one better able to perform it, regardless of what their IQs are. In a lot of situations, however, you need to answer something along the lines of "which one is better able to learn new skills" and ignoring rationality and IQ there would be shooting yourself in the foot.

  The idea of "high level rationalists" in general also just irks me. It feels like simply sliding back in basic primate mode: find a pack leader, someone to respect and admire, and defer to them.

If that's your idea of high level rationalists then I get why this is bothersome to you, but I think you're "doing it wrong," or the people you're thinking of are, or something, because this is not how it works in my head or in the rationalist social circles I've been part of.

When I see someone smarter than me, I want to /feed/ off them. I don't want to follow them and dress like them and get their autograph, and I don't want to signal allegiance so I'll survive the tribal purge that will inevitably result from their ascent to power. I'm not trying to share in the spoils of their conquest, or have them tell me what to do so I don't have to think about it. I want to /absorb the patterns their brainwaves form/ in whatever medium they demonstrate their intelligence and rationality in, and then I want to merge /my/ ideas with theirs and see what other awesome stuff might come out. Because it measurably improves my life and the lives of those I interact with.

I don't give EY's facebook or blog posts a high priority spot in my attention list because he's a "pack leader," I do it because he's demonstrated value. Same with others who can teach me new things that make a difference in my life or others'. If you're not willing to accept frames like "high level rationalists" then I don't really know how your internal system of cached attention-direction works. My suspicion is that you have one of some sort, I would be very surprised if you just paid equal attention to everyone because the idea of recognizing that some people actually have more valuable things to say than others is offensive to you somehow.

If what you /actually/ meant by this was simply that the phrase irks you for all of what you said after that, specifically because it lulls people into a false sense of security about "okay here's this really smart person so they will know how to solve X super complex problem that everyone's being stuck in," then that's much more sensible, but also seems like less of a concern than the failure mode that's actually occurring in the world.

It's not about insulting this or that. I'm just saying, I don't feel like the reason why more people don't try the SAD cure with lamps is because they can't logically come up with it. Some of them might just be unwilling to take that financial risk (even though a lot of people have $600, not a lot of people are in condition to spend and potentially sink them on a hunch), for example. Some might have done it, but not said it on the internet. Some might have done it /and it might not have worked for them/. Or they had other logistic problems, people or pets in the house who couldn't put up with it, couldn't afford the electricity bill, and so on. There's a bunch of reasons why people don't do this sort of thing that aren't as simple as "they're just not clever enough". In this case, EY's application of rationality is to the idea that there are perfectly good reasons why, without considering yourself better at medicine than doctors, you can imagine coming up with a good therapy for this specific thing. It's not in /actually doing the thing/. In fact, his rationality was used to overcome a hurdle /that only moderately rational people to begin with/ encounter: the "wait, but wouldn't doctors know better if the solution was really this obvious?" one. A less rational or knowledgeable person might just enter full Dunning-Kruger mode and string their house with lamps without ever wondering about that - and just happen to stumble upon the solution.

#+end_quote

That's pretty much it; also I think the phrase itself carries a lot of that connotation already. We're all nerdy-ish people here I expect; "high level rationalist" to me evokes the image of a level system, so a linear scale of skill of sorts. I think that's the wrong way of thinking about pretty much any real world skill outside of relatively easily gauged and consistent ones like how good you are at chess or go (but those tend to be very specialised). It irks me also because when talking about a "rationalist" there's already an implication we're talking about an expert in /meta/-knowledge, which in itself establishes a sense of primacy.

So, if I have to be rational about it: yes, I appreciate EY's writings. I think a lot of them can be insightful, if only in helping me put into words things that I only understand at an intuitive level. I don't think it's even in dispute that I would have a lot to learn from him both in the field of AI and in general in that of statistics and probability (which I know, but probably not quite as well as I should or could). However, I think there's a problem when dealing with someone who's very good at making rational arguments (including myself): they'll also be very good at making rational-/sounding/ arguments with subtle, almost undetectable fallacies. I don't mean in bad faith; usually the person we're out to deceive the most is ourselves. So there's a double edge to this weapon. As you improve your defences, you also improve your own ability to attack them and wreck them. I don't know EY as a person. I know him from what he writes. To call him truly a "rationalist" in the sense of one who's able to /put in practice/ what he talks about (rather than just, say, an expert in logic, or Bayesian epistemology) I would need to, well, run the test; which would require me knowing him in person and getting a feel for whether he really is better at avoiding fallacies or at thinking outside of his own perspective than me (I don't have any doubt that he's better at these things than the /average person/; but 50% of the people are, so that's not much).

In other words, I think it's important to always take claims, ideas and teachings with a pinch of salt - which is the whole point of rationality, after all. As such I guess you could say I feel like attaching certain special labels to people - and especially a label such as "high level rationalist", with the implied meanings it carries - tends in itself to be a mechanism that favours the arising of certain biases we want to avoid inside our minds. I do have a classification of course, but I think not attaching names to things sometimes is a useful strategy to keep them more fluid and think about them in a more elastic way. You could say I prefer having in mind a gaussian curve of rationality where EY may place somewhere around plus three or four sigmas above the average, maybe, but not reduce the gaussian to a binned histogram and give big bold names to the classes. In /my/ mind, I think that helps me keeping a more elastic perspective and putting less resistance to any need to move a point up or down the curve. I assume a similar process may happen in other minds as well, especially as I see a lot of situations in which attaching names and labels seems to cement the status quo in people's mental models of reality and exacerbate divisions. BTW thanks for bringing this up, putting it into words actually helped me clear my feelings on the topic.

And if that's all rationality was, we wouldn't be having this discussion. But as I've repeatedly been trying to point out in this and other threads, just thinking of something is /not/ what it means to be rational or "clever" and that's why I don't actually think that there are people on EY's level working on all the Major Problems in the world.

****** I think trying to equate intelligence with rationality is a mistake. If rationality is your measuring stick for intelligence, then of course EY comes out on top. The man is so dedicated to rationality that he's written books on the topic; it is one of his areas of expertise.

This, in my opinion, does not make him instantly smarter than expert scientists. Rationality does not equal intelligence; if it did than EY would have been stupid to write the Sequences, because there would have been absolutely no point. In the same way it's possible to be a fool and still be rational, I think it's perfectly possible to be a genius, and irrational.

I don't find it at all implausible that a genius physicist can be smarter than EY, and a better physicist than EY ever could have been, and yet still be less rational, because to me 'smarter' doesn't have much to do with 'more rational'.

Judging intelligence by rationality is unfairly biased towards EY, because while other smart people have chosen to specialise in biology or chemistry or physics, he choose to specialise in rationality. It would be like judging intelligence based on skill in Primatology, and then claiming Jane Goodall is smarter than Einstein. Technically correct, if that's the scale you're using; but it's the scale that's the problem.

******* Oh, I'm definitely not equating rationality with intelligence. I value rationality far more. The ratio of people skilled in rational thought to people who are "just" intelligent is massively lopsided, and it's my belief that this is /why/ so many problems in the world remain problems. Because it's /not/ enough to just be intelligent. It's super useful and valuable, but for the really hard shit in life, intelligent people struggle almost as much as anyone else, in my experiences.

So I strongly disagree with the idea that rationality as an "area of expertise" is a poor measuring stick or a domain expertise that's as unrelated to general evaluations of people's value toward solving problems as other domain expertise, like primatology. Frankly I'm not really sure what you even mean when you think of rationality, if that's how you see it. Some list of memorized biases? Some convoluted and esoteric philosophical position? That's not the rationality that EY has learned and developed and taught, and it's not what I've been trying to teach at ESPR or SPARC or in my own story. It's a set of methodology for /determining what's true/ and /figuring out what works/, above all else. It's /hella/ more useful than any single other domain expertise, even if those domains are /still obviously necessary/ to become educated on to solve problems in their fields.

******** I think we're having a misunderstanding. What I was disagreeing with, was the assertion that somehow there weren't that many people smarter than EY, working on important problems. The actual comment I replied to was, if I remember correctly, talking about how even distinguished scientists can be limited in their rationality; and I think that saying that just because a talented scientist seems limited in their rationality means EY would be a better scientist than them, unfair. I find that, in my experience, even if scientists don't seem rational in daily life, they are extremely good at applying what we define as rationality to their craft. Science is all about determining what is true and figuring out what works. An award winning scientist definitely used rationality to get that award, even if they aren't explicitly rational, and this is why I find that assertion that we can just assume EY would do a better job so strange. I see rationality as a poor measuring stick, because in many cases people who don't know about it or haven't heard about it aren't trying to be rational all the time. I think it's a poor measuring stick for someone's ability to solve problems, because if we think that award scientists don't have it in spades, then we are clearly measuring it wrong. Maybe I need a new word. Rereading my arguments, I think I agree with you that many distinguished academics are 'limited' in their rationality, as they only seem to apply it to their own field. However, I think that while they are 'limited', they are still very, very good at rationality, within their area of expertise. Probably more rational in that area, then we can assume EY would be. Anyways, my main point is that rationality is not intelligence, which you agree with. One of your main points (if I'm understanding correctly) is that may celebrated intellectuals are limited in their rationality, which I agree with, and that rationality is more important that intellect, which I also agree with. I believe, however, that even someone limited in their rationality can still be extremely rational within their field. I find it hard to believe that a talented scientist isn't being rational when they make their discoveries, considering how similar rationality is to the scientific method, and how much of what I've read about eliminating bias on Lesswrong and in stories, I've heard again in lectures given by professors of science. Rationality, as a methodology, is mimicked by a lot of other schools of thought also dedicated to solving problems.

Essentially I disagree with the idea that EY, because of his impressive rationality, is automatically better than overall less rational experts in different fields, because lots of the fields I assume we're talking about (like science and engineering), require the development of in-field rationality to excel in. Essentially, I'm saying that even if someone's rationality is limited to their field, they can still be more rational within their area of expertise than we can assume EY would be, if that makes sense. Like how a super specialised AI can still be better at maths than an actual general intelligence, even if the general intelligence is still, by most measures, objectively a better thinker (if that metaphor makes sense).

Sure, but that's not what I said :P What I actually said was "This does not by any means make them stupid or incompetent, only limited in things like their ability to apply epistemological rigor to their beliefs and carefully assess complex systems and social dynamics with minimal prejudice or bias."

The real crux here seems to come down to what we define as Major Problems in the world. Since the original point I was arguing against, that there /aren't/ many people smarter than EY working on them, and you think that within particular domain expertise there are, then defining what they actually are is important.

If your perspective is that pure scientific research in fields like chemistry and physics and so on is the actual bottleneck for solving all the important and major problems in the world, then you're right. Award-winning scientists are probably pretty good at the epistemological rigor thing, within their own field.

If my perspective is that there are far more major problems in the world than pure scientific research is currently trying to address (so, complex problems like reducing poverty and eliminated diseases and increasing access to healthcare and so on) then I think I'm right.

Unless you /also/ think that not just award-winning scientists but also politicians, NGO leaders, entrepreneurs, etc are smart enough in their limited-field rationality to be more capable than EY in identifying the problems in their fields and coming up with solutions, in which case, again, I see no evidence of this from what I know of the major players trying to tackle major problems in the world.

Again, it doesn't make them dumb or incompetent. But it doesn't make them capable of actually outperforming a version of EY that was a domain-expert in their field. By my definitions, that makes them not /actually/ more clever/rational/competent. The "better informed" part often goes with the domain expertise, but honestly, it really doesn't always. And again (again) that doesn't mean there aren't /good reasons/ for that, like "they're too busy dealing with the politics of their position to actually inform themselves about what's actually true and useful to solving the problem they're working on," but that still doesn't justify the original claim.

********** Reducing poverty and eliminating diseases and increasing access to healthcare are all areas where, as far as I can tell, intelligence or rationality isn't the only limiting factor on success. It's like global warming. Everybody is smart enough to understand it is a problem, and yet progress is still slow, because there's only so much rational evidence can do. Many of these problems are problems because of how hard it is to convince people to work together, or to coordinate, or to trust each other, or to put aside there differences and actually try and solve the issue. And yes, rationality would definitely help in achieving all of this, but I don't think that just because somebody is the most rational, they could do it better than anybody else.

If EY could jut sit in a room collecting evidence and thinking, and then post a solution and have everybody try it without question, then I would agree with you. But getting anything done on a societal level (especially when it comes to actually solving big problems on a large scale), requires so many other skills, abilities, and traits that I can't automatically agree that he would be better at it than everybody else who has tried. The only one I can think of off the top of my head right now isn't the best example, but perhaps one such trait is emotional resilience. Getting people to work together and trying to actually solve these kinds of problems in the real world is often stressful, and it's no use being the most rational if you burn out halfway through the process.

Essentially, I think there's a reason that the actions of climate scientists, despite probably being, on average, more rational than politicians, aren't really the important factor in stopping global warming, while the actions of politicians are. Rationality is an amazing methodology, and probably one of the most important traits to have when it comes to solving problems, and it's probably a trait that enhances the effectiveness of all your other traits as well. But if we're talking about solving societal problems on a large scale, than I don't think it's importance is so dramatically more than that of other traits, that we can judge someone the best possible societal repair man based on rationality alone.

Essentially, I think that if solving the problems you mentioned was a matter of pure rationality (to the point where we would appoint the problem-solvers based on their rationality alone), then they wouldn't still be problems. The professions that work on these kind of things could definitely benefit from rationality training, but I think there's probably a reason that these kind of jobs aren't already full of the most rational people, and it probably has to do with the kind of people capable/willing to do the work (and not just the thinking).

To get even more down to it (because writing 'essentially' again would just feel bad): teaching rationality is a great thing to do, and I definitely think it benefits the world. But I think there are reasons EY choose to do that (as well as the other stuff he does), instead of becoming a politician/charity worker/healthcare policy maker/etc..., and those reasons would probably effect his ability to the job dramatically better than the people already doing it.

So while I am willing to concede that EY may be smarter and more rational than most of the people who have been trying to solve these problems since history began, I don't think I agree that that would automatically make him better at solving them.

Also I feel like making this kind of equivalence is fundamentally wrong. Like saying some expert in a different field would be better at EY at rationality if they just bothered to learn it, because there success in an adjacent area of expertise proves they have the potential to also dominate his. It just feels disrespectful. But of course that's just a feeling and the weakest part of my argument, so if you choose to reply to anything, don't reply to that. I just felt like I had to put it out there in case anybody could help me put it into better words.

But no, that doesn't mean what you're saying is true. And I feel mildly annoyed that I have to point this out, because it feels vaguely like being gaslighted if someone tries to insist that everyone is "X positive thing" and I have to be the one willing to say the obviously-true-thing that makes me sound like an asshole, which is that no, they aren't.

Not everyone is actually smart, or clever, or whatever. Even taking into account individual specialties and skills, objectively no, they aren't.

Not everyone is actually physically beautiful "in their own way." Say what you will about subjectivity of beauty, we can actually measure this and in every meaningful way, no, they aren't.

Not everyone is actually interesting or meaningfully unique. Any combination of arbitrary and near-infinite features may be technically unique, but when it comes to determining how much attention people are willing to actually give each other, no, they aren't.

And not everyone is actually contributing in some way to the solving of Great Problems. That just doesn't match my observations and experiences. Great Problems are Great because they are /hard/ and life very rarely works like movie scripts where plucky salt-of-the-earth heroes solve problems that the smartest people struggle with. Small localized optimizations, yes. Worldwide problems, no. You need smart people for those, and smart people are /rare/. Even intelligent people are not as rare as actual, usefully smart ones. And "rational" ones are even rarer. I wish the world was different, but it's not.

If you're using the "shoulders of millions of hardworking individuals" thing to mean that those smart people need a whole society to make their coffee and beds and pencils and computers and shampoo and food and car and everything else that they use day to day, yes, of course, but that is absolutely shifting the goal posts from "People more clever and better informed than Big Yud etc etc," and this conversation would be resolved if you would just admit that instead of trying to find ways to make it still apply by changing the argument completely.

Yes, /of course/ we shouldn't mistake the popular and visible face of an accomplishment as the only person who contributed to it. But that's a strawman, and if you think the original goal post hasn't shifted because every tiny bit of inspiration and perspiration adds up to the big wins, that's just... wrong. A millions of people have spent literally billions of dollars on charities that accomplish nothing but help thousands of people have jobs that they can be proud of but which nudge the world toward an optimal place absolutely zilch. And that's being generous and not assuming they do more harm than good.

Genius is NOT 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. It's important, yes, massively important, but you know what? A lot of people are working their asses off every day and they're not doing anything new or interesting or important to anyone outside their own life, in any way that affects the state of the world or helps on-net. "Genius" loses all meaning if we reduce it to 1 part per 99ths hard work. That's not the world we live in.

99% of everybody else is NOT inspiring. This is a false narrative that makes everyone sound like the heroes working together to save the world, and I get why it's an important weapon to fight against the also-false narrative that there's some Protagonist upon whose herculean singular efforts the world turns, but it's taking things way too far and avoiding the rather obvious truth:

There are MANY protagonists. Each fighting in their own way, attributing their own genius, to their own causes.

But they are NOT common, they are NOT the majority, and if people think they are, if people think little optimizations that make their own life easier or maybe help out their family or friends or coworkers is "enough," then they cede and abdicate and excuse themselves from the actual heroic responsibility to take up the /really/ hard work, of pushing themselves /beyond/ tiny local optimizations into the actual, commonly-used-and-much-more-sensible-definition of the originally used phrase, "Big Problems," which are not solved by a billion people working hard in their own separate directions, but a relatively small handful of people working cleverly at the right time, in the right place, on the right problem, and not giving up until it's actually done, and the world is meaningfully different as the result of /their/ genius and effort in a way that's intrinsically different than anyone else on the planet's own genius and effort toward their own local optimizations.

If your main objection is actually this:

#+begin_quote

Then sure, of course not, because /magic isn't real./

I agree with more or less everything you say here, and continue to think that our difficulties are of perspective rather than fundamental. Worse, they're probably rooted in my own unclear or poetic phrasings.

I agree, for example, that perspiration for its own sake is often a waste. My point, and I conjecture Edison's, is that ideas are cheap. My addition to his quip is that genius is born more from its context than its singular inspiration. There's no Einstein without the crucible of physics thinkers and experimenters in late 19th century Germany. And if that set of schools and labs hadn't developed there, it might very well have developed somewhere and somewhen else and some other brilliant kid who in our world grew up thinking about boiler pressure maintenance or mechanical calculation or market forces or animal husbandry would have been imagining travel at the speed of light...

...and been willing to do the work of proving it, instead of the work of becoming an inventor, or a farmer, or an entrepreneur.

********** I like to think that genius is not primarily a property of a person, but an event in a group. Our narrative tropes make us see genius as primarily manifesting as a property of some individuals, but I argue that those narrative tropes are misguiding our perceptions. The narrative framework of individualism restricts our vision. The framework of individualism is widely spread and especially dominant in the english speaking western culture (this might be a meme I believe blindly without evidence; i'm not very familiar with other cultures, but lets just roll with this for now), and it guides our planning and structuring of the real world. Individualism might not have been the smartest framework to choose, but it was chosen anyway, and as a result we as Humanity have constructed a simulacrum reality that reaffirms the assumptions of Individualism, most visibly by electing singular Presidents to lead our companies and state governments. So in that sense, Individualism offers the proper mental tools for understanding reality, but I argue *IT'S NOT ENOUGH!*. It works locally, but another framework would bring forth more favorable results globally.

BIG CHANGE follows the flims of the leaders of big organizations, such as state machines? That's the simulacra reality of individualism.

Even BIGGER CHANGE follows when *an idea gains critical mass in the psychic medium that is the collective of human brains*. When people work in unison, guided by an idea, it can create change much larger than any single leader could (realistically) achieve. United masses of people don't just lead countries, they form them, destory them, create new modes of operation that are unlike any other state apparatus seen before.

To be fair, TWA's writing style in of itself was extremely memorable (remember the jokes about 'plot toxicity'?) with no other story known to the rational community having a very similar writing style. If the author is already known by other works, then it is pretty likely that the author went to extreme lengths to write in a very different fashion to disguise their style. It's even stated as such in the very first [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][chapter]].

Anyway long story short, Naruto in TWA has a strong ability for introspection and self-reflection that I feel is mirrored very similarly to Bella in Luminosity. There is no really good reason. Alicorn just someone who I know to be Eliezer's friend with a strong talent for writing and is at the top of a list with very few candidates on it.

I just find it difficult to believe Eliezer wrote TWA while also writing the last few chapters to HPMOR. His hints about TWA makes a lot more sense to me if he was a beta-reader instead of being the author.

It certainly seems possible, but the writing style isn't particularly like HPMOR. It also doesn't have the same hyper-pedagogical feel that HPMOR, Three Worlds Collide, and The Dark Lord's Answer have.

None of those things are super strong evidence in the opposite direction, of course, since I would never have predicted that A Girl Corrupted was EY based on those criteria.

But what /is/ similar enough between the two stories that so many people are very confident they're the same person? Is it just that "rationalist fanfiction that isn't poorly-written" is such a small class, and that the timing works out?

Both of them use the rules available in the world. Used cleverly and lucky enough, but that's it. Jinchuriki's, versatile and powerful jutsu, ton of magic spells and unexplored magical properties of the world... yeah, all of them are part of the world. Local world. No need to explore the deep space or other realms for those.

If we went with dinosaur theme, we'd see this kind of example by a new, super-proficient and incredibly aggressive organism taking over earth.\\
Improbable? Yes. Impossible, given what dinosaurs experience (in their collective lifespans if not singular lives)? No. New species and mutations emerge all the time (given large enough timescale).

What examples could work?\\
[[https://fictionhub.io/story/the-metropolitan-man/][The Metroplitan Man]] would work, if only partly. Superman breaks known physics in many ways, after all. It's not as catastrophic (especially given his minimal interference), but outside-context none the less.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP&N20]] also works, if still on a smaller scale. He's not of this realm, and his abiltiies baffle anyone around him. Give a lvl 20 mage such a journey, and you'll see a /real/ meteor impact.

My point is that meteor strike should come from /outside/ what we know. Outside all the known rules and plots.\\
Like Naruto continues his uplift work but suddenly an army of nano-chakra-bots come and raze all his work because alternate universe Orochimaru decides it's a good idea to conquer the multiverse.\\

** I went and read waves arisen based on this recommendation, prior to finishing the article. From the first part of your article I had expected a more catastrophic event to end Waves Arisen.

To me, the Asteroid Strike in HPMOR wasn't Harry fooming, it was the End of the World prophecy. Everyone was tooting along playing their roles, learning magic and playing politics, Voldemort Voldemorting, Dumbledore Dumbledoring, until Dumdum checked the prophecies and discovered he had BIGGER PROBLEMS. There was an asteroid coming. There was nothing they could do about it. The world was going to end, full stop.

This is the kind of threat I imagined and mentally categorized as "Asteroid Strike", though I know get what you mean by the outside experience for the rest of society for Harry and Naruto's fooms.

To me, the climate change metaphor was the real kicker in Waves Arisen. We can speculate that the techniques Naruto came up with may have in fact been utilized by the "Ancients" -- that they had seen the potential for munchkined superweapons and chakra factories using water ninjitsu, and that the resulting arms race flooded the planet. Or, maybe even more realistically, that it was merely the combined actions of a few hundred million ninja leveraging relatively ordinary powers on a global scale.

This kind of scenario is the much scarier and more likely scenario in our world. Not a single person coming up with a neat trick and taking power, but a lot of people driven by game theory and politics to defect and escalate until the world is destroyed.

We've faced this dilemma with Nuclear weapons, which was survivable because the actions required are overt and the consequences obvious and direct. We're facing it with Climate Change, which may not be because all it takes is for people to /keep living normally/ - keep using energy and technology and climbing the consumption ladder and growing technology and civilization, like we've done for millenia. The million small acts are perfectly sufficient to destroy the world and kill everyone.

And we will face it very soon with AI, which will be a combination of the two - a natural progression of incremental improvements, motivated by economics and politics, that result in a sudden and likely catastrophic FOOM.

All it takes is for things to continue the way they are - for people to keep improving AI gradually, and then for one idiot CEO some day to hire some eggheads to build a big smart program and give it the instruction to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149]["maximize shareholder value".]]

​

This is the real meaning of an asteroid strike IMO - either natural events or unintended consequences crashing down on everyone's head in a way that is completely unavoidable once it starts. It's not a satisfying literary technique to have Naruto breaking the water clones to refill his chakra en mass for the final battle only to discover he's flooded the rest of the plateau by accident and everyone dies - but this is the real danger.

This is by far the funniest thing I've read all day, and had I not written this message I'd be reasonably confident that it would be the funniest thing I read all day. Now that I've written this, some people would be interested in proving me wrong so if I (say that I) predict that I'll see something funnier, it would make it less likely for me to see something funnier and if I (say that I) predict that I would see something funnier, it would make it less likely to be so. Of course after saying the above people may try to outsmart me and do the opposite of what I claim to expect them to do in response to my action, but I'll want to outsmart them so this goes on ad infinitum. As such, I would not make any explicit predictions, but please send me funny stuff.

*** I can personally attest that the answer is yes, because I have never watched or read /any/ of the source material. Not a single comic frame, not a single cartoon second. And I still quite enjoyed The Waves Arisen.

Though, to be fair, I had already read a number of other Naruto fanfictions. Pro tip, [[/u/velorien][u/velorien]]'s Lighting Up the Dark is a rather confusing starting point if you've never read any Naruto at all before.
