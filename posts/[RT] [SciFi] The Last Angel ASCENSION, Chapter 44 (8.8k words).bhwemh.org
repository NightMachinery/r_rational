Last Angel Ascension is an excellent sequel to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The last Angel]], holds its own [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAngel][TV tropes]] page, is based upon a rogue AI, scheming and plotting after earth was destroyed some years back.

Well worth the read, one of the better pieces of fiction out there in my narrow and limited opinion.

Ascension is coming to an end of its arc, with 6? Chapters to go.

Goes without saying, I am not the author and do not know their reddit handle.

My one major criticism of it, along with the work it's a sequel to, is that the author doesn't seem to often stray very far from their comfort zone. Despite having several alien POV characters, I don't usually feel like I'm in an alien mind. Aliens think in terms of "sows," of "apes;" species are classified using earth-based taxonomies that should not be useful in describing alien races; the species feature distinctly human features (most species are humanoid and are bipedal with eyes and ears and shoulder blades; Tribunes sweat when nervous, and bite the insides of their lips when frustrated, and have adrenaline when they fight); alien ships are named using human concepts (e.g. "Gilded Antler"); an alien religion has a Hell and demons.

And even when the author talks about pre-genocide humans, most of the references are to Western history, Western literature, Western mythology. "I possess the only remaining records of millennia of Earth's knowledge. I remember the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance. I remember every name of every scientist, soldier, philosopher and artist who shaped the course of human civilization."

That is to say, there's nothing wrong with it that isn't also wrong with, say, /Star Trek/ in its various incarnations, but it's a little disappointing that someone who didn't have to figure out how to put any of this on camera didn't go farther afield to make the reader feel like they're looking at unfamiliar things through unfamiliar eyes.

It /is/ getting better; where the three initial dreadnaughts were all named after Greek deities (there is /no way/ that China, India, and the Islamic countries would have let that go without protest), Red One's children are starting to go a bit farther afield for their names, and the Naiads feel truly alien in a way that the other races don't. But, to use the latest chapter as an example: this chapter has POV segments from a Prolocutor, a Judiciary, a Worker, a Builder, a Prelate, two Tribunes, and an AI, and apart from little details like having a second pair of hands, I can't tell any of them from human by the way they perceive the world.

That's an artefact of writing; a reader can understand reptilian, mammalian or therapsid - but describing alien species by completely alien taxonomies and phylogenies is going to require explanation, and bring the story to halt. "Roughly mammalian" versus "Henagheit, which had such traits as [insert roughly mammalian characteristics]. It's the long way around to get a concept across, aka the Karen Traviss method, where she would put in a Mandalorian concept or phrase, then add the actual description for it, over and over and over.

I've had questions about using actual terms such as "fractal cracking" and "pedipalps" in appropriate contexts previously, so I'm not certain that making the text even more obtuse is going to bring any particular benefit to the story.

I've been trying to work on that, adding more foreign species types and variation in forms. Conjoiners, Kobolds, Hesitants, Mules for example.

​

...why would aliens /not/ have a concept of gilding, or antlers (or comparable ideas) and want to reference/venerate certain ideals, concepts or cultural icons in their ships? Many alien ship names /do/ reference the latter as well.

There's a scene in /The Armageddon Inheritance/, where the humans are examining the wreckage of an alien fleet and they see one ship in particular. The translation of its name is /Deathdealer/. The vessel was named in an alien language according to alien ideals, but the concept can still be communicated to a human audience.

​

...yes? It's not the same as the human concept of hell. Why wouldn't a religion, even an alien one, have a concept of a 'bad place' with 'bad things'?

I guess the point I was trying to make there was not that they /were/ described using such terms, but that they /could accurately be/ described using such terms. What does "mammalian" or "reptilian" even /mean/ when applied to an extraterrestrial life-form? They're classifications designed to divide uniquely terrestrial life forms from other uniquely terrestrial life forms, and I'd have to think that any species that originated extraterrestrially would have enough /other/ differences to deserve their own taxonomic category, to the point where "mammalian" or "reptilian" would mislead more than it would accurately inform.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm not asking you to take use Traviss method, but rather to describe what you are trying to describe, rather than using terms that don't quite fit. Mammals are distinguished from other terrestrial animal species by being (largely) warm-blooded, quadrupedal, with mammary glands, fur, and a specific ear structure, and young who are born rather than hatched. "Mammal" also implies "vertebrate," so this creature has a spinal cord, lungs, a blood-pumping heart, and other such organs. And "vertebrate" implies "animal," so your alien's cells are required to have a specific structure that distinguishes it from etc. etc....

Do you really mean to convey /all/ of that? If you just mean "furry and warm-blooded," the descriptor "mammalian" serves to confuse rather than to enlighten, and you'd be better off just describing it as "furry and warm-blooded." If you /are/ trying to convey all of that... that raises a lot of questions about the convergent evolution of this species, on a planet with a presumably dissimilar history to ours, and starts to disrupt my suspension of disbelief.

I'm certainly not asking you to make the text more obtuse; I'm asking you to make it more /explicit/.

#+end_quote

Antlers, sure. A single point of convergent evolution, doesn't really strain credulity, even one that has only developed once on Earth. Gilding, though... It implies valuing things for their rarity; it implies a certain concept of beauty; it implies coming up with the idea of finding a shiny, rare, soft rock and pounding it so flat that it becomes gold foil, and then painstakingly wrapping the foil around an object. Which comes back to "why are all of these aliens so /human/?" Why are their values so similar to ours?

And a species which both values gilding, and /has/ (or knows a species that has) antlers? That's getting weird: antlers, again, are a pretty rare feature on our world.

/Deathdealer/, by contrast, makes use of a concept common to all living beings (life's end), and implies delivery of that concept to other living beings. It's a concept that's pretty much /universally/ translatable.

#+begin_quote
  Why wouldn't a religion, even an alien one, have a concept of a 'bad place' with 'bad things'?
#+end_quote

Okay, let me be clear: I'm referring to "Interlude: Encounter 163" at the end of Chapter 23 of /The Last Angel./ I'd provide a link, but Spacebattles is being a dick right now and I have to access it through a proxy service that doesn't give me a clear URL.

Anyway.

The character literally describes /Nemesis/ "[rising] through an inferno" of burning oil and fuel atop a sea as "[rising] from Hell."

Sure, it /could/ be coincidental that another religion on another planet has a "bad place" /just happens/ to contain such vivid fire imagery, or, alternately that the experience of a "bad thing" from a "bad place" that evoked the religious one /just happens/ to involve fire even though their religion's "bad place" doesn't feature it...

Either way, the use of the word "Hell" with /that/ imagery is just /way/ too on the nose to be coincidental.

And it frankly just feels to me like a missed opportunity. What unique ideas would a species of genius philosophers, who pursue science at the expense of all else, have about death and the afterlife? Why, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_fire][lake of fire]], of course!

...

Now, maybe that's not a reference that you intended. But it's just one more example of an alien mind not /feeling alien/. If I pull back and look at that segment as a whole, the Thoughtful doesn't feel, well, thoughtful. She doesn't think of the world in terms of what she can learn from it. Or in terms of creating something. Or in terms of a puzzle to be solved. She thinks of the world largely like I do when I, as a human technician, am forced to assume a management role.

Contrast with your own Naiads.

That makes things clearer. I do remember that; the scene isn't quite what you've described.

/"I know what Hell sounds like. That was the first cogent thought that Ashl'eua had had for several long minutes as she stood on the bluff, watching the ocean burn. She had been an avowed atheist until this moment. Perhaps she still was; there were no gods. No god could have allowed this to happen./

/No, there were no gods... but there was a Hell. She knew this because she'd seen one of its demons. She'd heard it speak./

.....

/Ignoring all sense of reason, she had walked up to a small cliff overlooking the bay, standing on the edge and watched a demon's birth./

........

/It had risen from the inferno, sheets of blazing water spilling from its hull, patches of burning oil and fuel clinging to its baroque armour, flickering like the torches lining the walls of some ancient fortress..../

....

/There were no gods, but there were demons. She'd seen one rise from Hell."/

At no point is fire associated with the character's version of hell; she associates the burning water and fuel with /torches along battlements/, not the underworld. Moreover, she's obviously being hyperbolic (and with good cause, given what happened). For example, in /The Doomsday Machine/, Commodore Decker refers to the Planet Killer as "a demon right out of Hell!" (tum te tum tum....). By the logic here, Decker associates deep space with hell, because the PK came from there. That's not true, of course. He's traumatized and thinking/describing it emotionally in that scene, just as the character in the interlude is after watching hundreds of people die. We're not actually given any substantive information on the Thoughtful (or at least the culture that Ashl'eua has the most familiarity with) version of hell.

The lake of fire isn't a reference that I intended, because it's not actually there....

#+begin_quote
  That's alien. And I'd like to see much more like it.
#+end_quote

That's also why Naiads can be hard to write. Making them comprehensible, yet still foreign in thought and concept. But they are fun to write, and I hope to add more from in, especially when we get to [FRAGMENTED DELETED].

Thanks for the input!

#+end_quote

I would ask this question differently: why /would/ they?

"References", "veneration", "ideals", "concepts", "culture", "icons" --- all of these are human concepts, arising from the subtleties of human psychology and human minds, development of which in turn heavily depended on our evolutionary history and environment. A tradition of giving ships deeply meaningful names implies some or all of the below:

- A conscious ability to construct abstract mental representations of vaguely-defined categories of objects (E. g., "[antlers] are certain strictly-defined bone growths found in members of the [Cervidae] animal family".)

- A tendency/ability to classify said abstractions using other abstractions. (E. g., "[gilded] implies [high-status] + [wealthy] + [yellow] because of historical, economical, and physical properties of gold".)

- A tendency/ability to misuse the abstractions to refer to objects /resembling/ the objects from the original category in some way, even when they're clearly outside of it. (E. g., "this ship is [yellow] and is a [defensive weapon], therefore it resembles a [gilded] [antler], even though it's neither made of gold nor an antler".)

- A desire to assign personal descriptors to inanimate objects/tools in order to give them an appearance of individuality and/or in order to elevate them above other objects in their category. (E. g., "our ship will be named 'Gilded Antler', because there is no other ship under that name and because [glided] implies [high-status]".)

- A desire/tendency to generate descriptors with certain properties: short, simple, and based on abstractions which usually refer to static physical objects. (I. e., we prefer names of animal parts or certain metals of historical significance to abstract mathematical constructs, quotes, or gibberish. "Gilded Antler", not "37 1221", not "x^{n>2}+y^{n>2}=z^{n>2}", not "(entire text of /Moby Dick/)", not "AAAgrgeAAB".)

Aliens wouldn't necessarily have any of this. They could recognized "gold" as "/this/ kind of metal", but lack any emotional response to [gold] as a concept. They could see [gold] as [positive], but consider unfathomable to refer to objects that /don't/ contain gold as [gilded]. They could be able to give objects poetic descriptors, but lack the desire to do so because they have no concept of a stable identity. They could give objects poetic descriptors, but use mathematically elegant strings of symbols for that, or follow some other naming tradition.

And so on. Why would they have a religion, a concept of death, an afterlife, the concept of "badness", the concept of a "place"..? Is the human way /really/ the only way a sentient creature could look upon the world?

****** But all of that just brings us back around to 'why wouldn't they?'

Furthermore, the kind of story you describe is best served by things like /Blindsight/ or C.J. Cherrnyh's works, where the issue of grappling with alien intelligences is a focal point of the narrative, and that still requires communication and translation for the reader. In a military sci-fi epic with a dozen or more 'on-screen' species, it would completely destroy any story or plot momentum to have to engage with each species in that manner. And it gets worse if two non-human species are interacting with no humans present, since their dealings, mannerisms and perspectives with each other are going to be even further outside a human narrative.

I can understand the issue, and I do try to give the alien races as much of a foreign outlook as I can, but at the core of it, the kind of story where the aliens are as utterly removed from the human perspective as you describe isn't compatible with the kind of story I want to tell.

  'why wouldn't they?'
#+end_quote

Because they wouldn't have evolved to.

Why wouldn't they have legs and mouths? Because they evolved in an ocean so move by jet propulsion, and descended from a species that learned to eat through skin.

Why wouldn't they have eyesight and temperature-sense? Because they originally lived in an extensive cavern network with no natural sources of light and abnormally stable temperatures; instead they perceive magnetic fields.

Why wouldn't they have a sense of personal identity? Because they follow a reproductive strategy in which they "combine" with another member of their species on the cellular level, and then "de-combine", with a small chance of de-combining into three specimen; they do it once per day^{1}, and each combination/de-combination cycle mixes their "identities" up.

Why wouldn't they be able to classify abstract concepts? Intelligence arises when species end up needing to quickly adapt to changes in their environment. Human intelligence evolved to better respond to the environment of tribal politics ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Models][probably]]). /Their/ intelligence evolved because some kind of evolutionary shtick caused the autotrophs in their environment to change at a much faster speed than they used to, spreading according to strange rules and changing their properties, behaviours, and eatability at a breakneck pace. The aliens had to become smarter and smarter in order to follow the resulting complexity, and so they became adept at modelling and manipulating the outside world, but didn't develop most of the tools for the manipulation of /ideas/ --- they're superintelligent engineers but bird-level philosophers and schemers.

Evolutionary environments differ extremely, and would give rise to wildly different minds. "Humans" are just a small area in the space of all possible minds; the probability that aliens would resemble us as closely as you're suggesting is vanishingly small.

Oh, yes, I agree. Writing alien aliens is extremely hard; any story which features them in a prominent role would need to spend a lot of time on exploring them. If your story mainly focuses on other questions, it makes sense to cheat in order to make aliens easier to write. I'm just arguing against the idea that it isn't wildly implausible. (Unless there are some other factors at work, like "the universe is a simulation", or "we and aliens were originally from the same species, but ended up scattered across different planets for reasons".)
