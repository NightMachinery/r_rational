** Shinsekai Yori! I love Shinsekai Yori. Fantastic anime.

Edit: OP you've got a couple of massive paragraphs in the middle that could really do with being broken up into smaller ones. Wall of text effect is real.

**** It starts off in a seeming-idylic low tech japanese village where everyone has psychokinetic powers of similar type and great versatility. The story follows the life of a group of friends over ten or so years as they grow and mature into adults, slowly finding out more about the world around them and its hidden history. There are also interactions with the creatures known as queer-rats, who see them as gods because of their powers.

There is a good deal more to it than that, but I can't even hint at it apart from to say that the reveals are surprising, yet make perfect sense in retrospect and are fantastically well done. It's a thoughtful and subtle story that challenges your assumptions, one of the best anime I've ever watched.

** For the anime/manga challenge, I wrote part of a fanfiction for my favorite anime, From the New World. I've finished it now, and it came out being a lot more substantial in terms of length than I initially expected.

From the New World isn't something I've ever seen discussed outside of anime specific circles, so I'll link its info here:([[http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori]]). From the New World definitely fits the criteria of rational fiction, and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who likes rational fiction since I think it's a prime example: the ideas are really interesting and novel and the execution both visually and narratively is spot-on.

So, my story is not 'rationalifying' the anime, but is just what I consider to be a logical continuation from that point. For those who aren't into anime or animation, or those who are more literature fans, the novel it's based on has just finished being fan translated. Search for the Shinsekai Yori novel. The anime is a very faithful and visually breathtaking and inventive adaptation.

I had a lot of fun writing this story. I hope you guys get something out of it, too!

** I thought that was very interesting. Thanks for writing it, there aren't enough Shinsekai Yori fics. If I'm interpreting this correctly, [[#s][]]

** Wow, that's pretty excellent stuff. The rather unique setting of the source material is used to great effect, and the tone is pretty interesting.

** Entertaining, but something bugs me about it.

All that semi-mystic philosophising about being one with the world and in the end they go for a slightly larger, but still similarly distinct object as the target. If you go with the implied message, surely the target should be the whole universe without discrimination, rather than one tiny specific piece of it? Just seems discordant to me. Sure, Earth is special from our perspective, but forgoing everything else in its favour just doesn't line up with the previous message as I see it. It's like graduating from drawing a boundary around a person to drawing a boundary around the planet, when the whole point is that there is no boundary at all.

*** I thought about this while writing the story. Here's my take:

I think what you're saying is fundamentally valid, but humanity hasn't gotten to the point where it could effectively do that. They would have to see the entire universe as one object, be able to have an accurate conception that encompasses all of reality, a 'theory of everything' in order to do it this way. So Saki is choosing to do something that a person would be capable of doing, since the Earth is one concrete object that can be visualized, when viewed from space in that way. That's why they had to go into space to do it. In addition, there's nothing else near the Earth, so for practical purposes there's no real difference, since the not-earth part of the universe is essentially inaccessible (unless they actually travel there with the spaceship of course). Maybe at some point in the future they will reach that state (able to visualize the entire universe), but it won't be for some time.

The thought's also that as opposed to before, if they did take the children up there upon their awakening, it would result in humanity passively guiding the evolution of other earth life in a constructive way, like the monoliths in 2001, as opposed to haphazard and in some cases destructive like we saw in the show.

**** Fair enough. I suppose it works fine in practice, so it's silly to cavil about philosophical consistency. Not sure I would have been able to ignore it, if I were in Hidenori's place.

I just had to find something to complain about, since I've always had a big problem with the rituals. I guess they've bred the non-susceptibility to hypnosis out of humans by that point or something.

** I like it, though the first half is stronger then the second. Her just suddenly having the idea that works with little or no narrative build up didn't really work for me.
