This is inspired by [[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]'s post yesterday about how Harry James Potter Evans-Verres would deal with being swapped out with 5th year canon Harry. (I posted this permutation of HJPEV-swapping-with-canon in a comment of that post and was encouraged to make this its own post.)

*Scenario:*

End-of-book!HJPEV overwrites canon Voldemort in the exact moment Voldemort first sees baby Harry. Lilly is alive and in combat stance, James is freshly dead. Our boy has less than three minutes to orient to his surroundings, diffuse Lilly, and attempt to resurrect (or freeze) James before James's brain starts to take serious damage. ^{Roll for initiative}

What are Harry's immediate actions?

Harry's immediate considerations

- What just happened?! Is this real, a simulation, time travel, enemy action, etc.
- How to deescalate Lilly
- Should he attempt to revive James
- What information should he reveal (i.e. his identity as Harry)

​

Once he resolves his initial isekaization, Harry has to deal with the fact that he is in the body of canon Voldemort with none of Voldemort's memories. If Harry just nopes out of Britain entirely (making Voldemort disappear suddenly), he will probably expect the Wizarding World to turn out much like he remembers it, minus one Boy-Who-Lived and plus one Witch-Who-Won. Harry will likely see his remembered history as a high score to beat, and will plot for a better victory for the Light.

What is Harry's "Clean up after Voldemort" plan?

Harry's Resources:

- Science and historical knowledge from an alternate universe (Yes, that does mean he can try to game the stock markets)
- True Patronus Charm, partial transfiguration, every other spell he's been shown to know in Methods of Rationality
- The body and full grown magic of Lord Voldemort and any artifacts Voldemort was carrying on his person
- His Dark Side, which may or may not lead him to behave like the local Voldemort
- The possible support of James and Lilly Potter (if he can win them over)

Harry's Impediments

- No memories from canon!Voldemort
- No magical knowledge form canon!Voldemort
- None of his own magic items such as the Cloak or his Time-Turner

Wild Cards

- His Vow
- Harry has a whole, undamaged "Tom Riddle"-labeled soul for the purposes of canon. There may or may not be interactions with the local Horcruxes
- 5 canon!Voldemort Horcruxes that may or may not have been overwritten with the new "Tom Riddle" soul


** I think the proper de-escalate is apparate away, taking James('s body?) with him to frigidero in a more secure location (e.g. Antarctica). If Verres-mort is unable to apparate then fly or run or literally anything to get away before Lily throws any of a number of deadly curses. You can always run your reveal later, provided that you are not immediately dead.

Step two is use the dark mark to bait the deatheaters into a non-lethal but incapacitating trap that they will definitely be caught by surprise given that canon Voldemort seems to have roughly zero security protocols.

Offer one of the deatheaters tied up and unconscious in front of the gates of Hogwarts to prove the incredibly fortunate situation you're in to Dumbledore and begin negotiating ASAP, you need to stop the carnage of the war and prevent more deaths as quickly as possible. (Ninja edit: spelling)

****** The way the Potters died was due to sheer incompetence:

- Why not have James or Lily be the secret keeper? Bill Weasley could be the secret keeper of Shell cottage in book 7 with 0 issues. Instead they trust a literal rat who sold out under pressure (and to be fair Sirius and Remus could have betrayed them too, easy for them to talk when they never got captured)

- Why didn't they have more protections to at least stall for time?

- As you said, no wands on them, or at least within convenient reach.

- James Potter could have turned into a stag and charged him down, but instead ran at him in human form.

- Dumbledore didn't have anyway to monitor them? Alert spells are a thing, he could have the entire Order teleport there in seconds if needed.

- Speaking of teleportation, Lily didn't even try escaping the house with Harry? No wand no apparation sure but no emergency portkeys or something?

It's almost criminal that the Order in the height of its power couldn't organise better defences than the scattered remnants in book 7 with mostly inexperienced members.

It's not exactly Rational Fiction^{TM} , but it definitely has a relatively rational and intelligent version of Harry as a main character, and the actual setting is absurdly interesting, since it takes the idea of Harry Potter's magocratic nobility and just sprints off into the sunset with it.

They even get the Granger family into it to abuse rune crafting, it's great.

I do remember that, when Voldemort was remembering the attack in DH, James had his wand on the couch beside him, but didn't pick it up before getting up, even though he had a few seconds in which to do so. Them not having their wands close at hand I can sorta-kinda believe, if with some SoD, but Rowling went out of her way to point out that James' wand was /right there/ and he got up to fight without equipping it. What was he going to do, tackle Voldy?

******* There's no maybe about it, the one known case of proper bad person trying to cast a patronus involved instead of a patronus summoning a horde of maggots which promptly ate the user alive.

Voldemort in canon 100% would not be able to cast a patronus, Snape was special in being able to. Voldemort works with dementors because he's evil and dementors are seemingly smart enough at least to negotiate with so he is working with them the normal way you work with people, just help them get what they want and match their ideals. He'd probably just apparate away or try physical bindings if the dementors ever made to attack.

That said, if HPJEV tries to counter dementors using his HPMoR tactics he's screwed as dementors had totally different weaknesses and just general properties in HPMoR. At least his normal patronus should still have some effect, as long as he actually focuses on happy memories, not just overcoming death as canon dementors have nothing to do with death.

#+begin_quote
  The Patronus Charm is one of the most ancient of charms and appears in many accounts of early magic. In spite of a long association with those fighting for lofty or noble causes (those able to produce corporeal Patronuses were often elected to high office within the Wizengamot and Ministry of Magic), the Patronus is not unknown among Dark wizards. While there is a widespread and justified belief that a wizard who is not pure of heart cannot produce a successful Patronus (the most famous example of the spell backfiring is that of the Dark wizard Raczidian, who was devoured by maggots), a rare few witches and wizards of questionable morals have succeeded in producing the Charm (Dolores Umbridge, for example, is able to conjure a cat Patronus to protect herself from Dementors). It may be that a true and confident belief in the rightness of one's actions can supply the necessary happiness. However, most such men and women, who become desensitised to the effects of the Dark creatures with whom they may ally themselves, regard the Patronus as an unnecessary spell to have in their arsenal.

*************** I mean, they just represent depression and work to induce despair as a result, it should be perfectly possible to become desensitized to always being somewhat morose and generally just not truly happy. Note this would also leave you unable to cast a patronus correctly, the trick is likely becoming densensitized without becoming a wreck of a human being unable to really connect to people or feel joy, but for a lot of dark wizards being a horrible person who struggles to find long term happiness in life is likely to just fuel the evil douche thing and be entirely on theme. It does very strongly imply too that Raczidian is not the only person to have failed, or he would not be "the most famous", to have a most famous of anything kind of requires there to be a less famous of it too.

And yes, it works on others. For example [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Lethifold][lethifolds]] share with dementors as having the patronus as their only known counter, and in general have a lot of similarities. The big one being that lethifolds literally kill and eat people and seem to have a slightly more mundane origin, even if we don't know what it is, they're not categorized as non-beings which seems to be reserved for the more embodiments of emotions kind of thing. No others are known that the patronus specifically counters, just those two for ones you actually need it for.

Rereading the lore about Raczidian, I'd say it's iffy regarding the "pure heart" requirement but I concur, Voldemort in his prime would not be able to nor have the need to cast a patronus. Which is probably better for Verres-mort when he needs to prove his case.

******** Which part?

- Voldemort definitely in his youth can cast a patronus. I remember reading somewhere dark wizards (in one case, on the scale of Voldemort or worse) can't cast patronuses. Instead maggots will appear or something. So current Voldemort would probably not be able to cast a patronus because of the whole horcruxes thing

- Dumbledore thing was a joke, Snape proved his loyalty by casting a doe patronus which symbolised his love for Lily Potter. Dumbledore considered this reason enough to trust him (even years after her death) as the reason for Snape to betray Voldemort. Other than that the Potters have stag (James, Harry) patronuses, having the same patronus would situationally be proof of loyalty to them.

- Realistically Verresmort could just cast a patronus (or learn to, been a while since I read that series so I've forgotten his capabilities) to prove his identity to Dumbledore, after which with Dumbledore vouching for him (he was at his peak influence in this era) and some plastic surgery, maybe a nose transplant, he would be in the clear. Sheer unlikelihood that the real Voldemort would be able to cast a patronus let alone have it be a stag would be enough to prove Verresmort's claim, assuming he isn't killed on sight (not in character for canon Dumbledore, so unlikely)

Basically as soon as Verresmort sorts out the mess at his parents' house it wouldn't be too difficult to prove his case to Dumbledore, whose word is basically law, which clears him to the rest of the world. Patronus to get Dumbledore to listen, offer memories as more proof if needed (there's no way Voldemort would be able to forge an entire detailed backstory when Slughorn can barely forge a few minutes worth of conversation).

Create a James simulacrum and put that with Lilly and canon!Harry hours before Voldie arrives. How good would a simulacrum have to be to fool canon!Voldie long enough for him to do the thing that wipes his memory?

Might think about finding a willing sacrifice, e.g. someone who wants to die anyway, to /polyjuice/ into James. I think HJPEV would find it morally questionable to cause the death of even someone willing for what one might call 'his own ends' in a situation like that where he still might find other ways, but then it's not like he /never/ kills.

That could be a plot arc -- "ok, we've got the canon time-turner, how do we make a good enough simulacrum without polyjuice OR use the polyjuice trick in a way that it won't seem against the nature of our relationship with human death?"

1) Bug out of the Potter house. Given that Lily's plan at this point is "sacrifice her own life without giving any violence in order to power her spell" its unlikely that she would attack Voldemort even if he seems vulnerable for a few seconds, thus he should be fine.

2) Figure out that hes in the past in an alternate timeline where things are slightly different and a few people (eg. voldemort) are stupider.

3) Gather all the death eaters in a place warded against apparition together while pretending to be Voldemort and kill them all, either with some kind of spell/gas/massive muggle bomb.
