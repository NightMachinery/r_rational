A horror short I wrote a couple years ago for a SV contest. Thought posting it here would be appropriate for Halloween.

Egil awoke to darkness. Was the power out? He reached for his phone, for the desk lamp, but there was nothing there. He floated in emptiness. No sights, no smells, not even the beat of his own heart. Fear and confusion warred, as he struggled to find something to struggle against. He couldn't remember what last happened, could only remember bits and pieces of his life. That, perhaps more than the darkness, gave fear victory.

"No." With a effort of will earned in physical rehab, he forced himself to pull out of the panic. He had remembered something. At times he had awoken to find himself stuck in the grey fog between dream and waking, paralyzed but aware. This was similar. Before he had forced himself to wake by focussing all his will on moving a single toe, but now he couldn't feel his body in the least. There was an alternative: to relax and fall back asleep. He had never before dared to take it, but perhaps now was the time.

Slowly he relaxed, imagining himself taking deep breaths, ignoring the figments that began flitting past his vision. Time passed, it seemed a long while, but he couldn't quite recall what he had been doing. Playing a game, perhaps? He was walking down the side walk in his neighborhood. His twin to his left, indistinct friends in front. He was laughing, a joke on the tip of his tongue, yet incomplete. He looked to his brother, who smiled and told the joke. A dream, he realized, just a dream, but what made him realize it?

Liv (her name was Liv, he just remembered) turned and skipped backwards for a step, laughing at his joke. He would have smiled, but he knew, somehow, that the frantic barking was a warning, a sign that something terrible was coming. A sense of foreboding pressed him to the ground, the taste of blood on his tongue. The street was a getting dimmer, consumed by shadows creeping in at the edges, even in the midday sun. He couldn't move, his muscles taut, only the incessant barking and his labored breathing audible above a rising susurration of indistinct voices.

He was lying on a metal table, irritated by an intermittent clicking noise coming from the metal behemoth above him. "Read it please." A pretty woman with red hair, contrasted with her blue costume. She held out a large stack of index cards with sentences written on the front. He squinted in the light. "His father worked as a fireman." He shifted uncomfortably, trying to resist the urge to scratch at the needle in his neck.

"Good!" The woman praised, and flipped the cards with a poker player's hands. "Now the next one."

Why was the woman treating him like a baby? Just because he had been so sick didn't mean he was a moron. "A woman and Mary both had," he paused for a moment, went back, "both had a fancy hat, but only the" he shook his head frustrated, he knew this wasn't difficult, why couldn't he just wrap his mind around it? He forced himself to speak slowly, bit by bit "the latter's was purple." He shifted, feeling the cold metal through the slit in the back of the embarrassing gown.

The memory faded, leaving him alone in the room. Good, he was remembering something clearly, for once. Who was that woman? She was giving him some sort of test, but it was too easy, or it should have been. The metal table, and that strange machine above him were disturbing, but not as bad as what had happened before. What /was/ that. The barking, the fear, the darkness. Egil shivered, forcing himself to yank the IV from his neck, and looked for his mom, for his dog, for anyone. He reflexively glanced over, reassured to see his twin brother to his left, like always, even if in this dream world he was ignoring Egil for some reason.

He wandered the hospital for hours. Some areas he knew very well, others were less clear. Indistinct figures appeared, phrases whispered, but nothing of meaning was said. When he was tired he returned to the comfort of his old hospital bed, confused and afraid, but mostly lonely. Egil slept, ignoring the ridiculousness of doing so in a dream.

"...Only course of action a Peri-Insular Functional Hemispherectomy. That means that we will completely disconnect the damaged hemisphere, while leaving it in place to lessen disturbance of the rest of the brain..."

A new voice, familiar, weathered, and slightly shrill. "How can you cut out half his brain! Surely you have something better than that, it sounds worse than the seizures!" His mother's voice. Egil gasped, head flooded with flickers of images, touches, smells.

"Ma'am I assure you, this is a state of the art procedure with easier postoperative course, and reduced long-term complications. This procedure has a very high success rate in intractable, migrational seizures like your son's."

His mother's voice came again, this time he could see her face, blonde hair falling over her eyes, hiding the crows feet that had grown deep in the last couple years.

The doctor buzzed on. "The incredible resilience of the brain allows one half to take over the function of the other half with limited impact. Fortunately the undamaged hemisphere has the majority of his language and memory function... Neuroplasticity of even the teenage brain is still sufficient..."

The voice faded into muddled hisses as the mask on his face fed a sweet gas to the count of ten.

Another memory, this one less clear, though perhaps that was just the doctor-speak. Egil frowned, then realized it was more like imagining frowning, like the dream this must be. When he knew he was in a dream, though, he could make himself wake up. All that did here was send him to the dark place.

Perhaps he was still in surgery? Though the nurse had told him he wouldn't dream under the gas. Did the surgery fail? Was he in a coma or something? It would explain his flawed memory. His surroundings slowly came into focus: the hospital room he had recovered in after the infection. Would this be where he woke up? If he woke up. He shook his head sharply, no point in dwelling on it. The doctor had said he was an ideal candidate. As he lay in the hospital bed, hoping he would wake up in it in real life, he found the germ of an idea, dancing just out of reach. There was something he was missing. As he looked for it, the sense of foreboding rose, presaged by the barking, no longer in the distance, but right next to him. He ran, but there was nowhere to go. Oh, of course...

He tried to scream when he woke to darkness yet again, hot panic rising at not knowing up from down. It was like when a wave flipped his board, and washed him under. A complete lack of direction. He forced himself to stop, not to breath, as he had no breath, just to do nothing. After a period of time, he was unsure how long, he beat down the panic. He was still so tired, like he needed to rest his eyes, despite seeing nothing. He stopped trying to make out anything in the black abyss, stopped trying to control his non-existent breathing. A long moment passed.

Egil was lying down, head cushioned by soft fur. A wet nose huffing at his ear. "Hugin," he whispered. "Good girl." He must not have responded to her warning barks fast enough, so his Labrador had interposed herself between his head and the hard tile, keeping him from hammering his brains out in the grips of the seizure.

He relaxed for a long moment, content to rest on his dog and catch his imaginary breath. As his mind calmed, the idea itched at his attention. If he was still asleep after surgery, or in a coma, why did he still have a seizure? 96% success rate they said! 96% success rate, all they need to do is cut your brain in half. He told them that was a dumb idea. Now he was stuck in a coma, /and/ still having seizures! What a joke.

Unless... Egil slowly looked over, seeing his duplicate lying next to him. He didn't have a twin, nor even a brother. His twin smiled weakly, and accepted an unseen hand lifting him into a wheelchair. The corridor outside the room was brightly lit, as the door opened for the wheelchair. The windows in the room looked out on perfect dark. The door shut, leaving him alone in the slowly fading bed. Unless, he thought, with a slow dread that felt like certainty, I'm the other half.


** For being the half /without/ the language skills, this half is surprisingly well-spoken.

*** Heh, I usually can't stand when narrative style tries to reflect the insanity of a character. In most cases it just makes the description incoherent and painful. So it may be less likely he would verbalize his thoughts like this, but as a story about his thought process, entirely from his perspective, I'm not sure how to convey that properly otherwise. Probably a better author could do so just with images. But to take your comment seriously, I'm no neurosurgeon, but from researching this procedure I think this capability within the plausible range. The brain typically has distributed capability, and can recover remarkably well. Keyword: Majority.

**** I remember reading a book some years back (a brief Google tells me that it was "Peace On Earth" by Stanislaw Lem) in which the narrator had had his brain bisected in a bizarre accident. In his case, each half of the brain retained control of half of the body; the narration was carried out by the left brain, since the right brain couldn't talk (but was clearly still active, since, among other things, it would pinch the bottom of any blonde the narrator passed - which got the narrator slapped about half the time and his right-brain twin slapped the other half the time).

I have absolutely no idea how accurate Lem's description of the two halves of the brain were (or even were intended to be) but if you can find a copy of the book, I can heartily recommend it; the protagonist remains same, merely unable to think in certain ways and with half his body under control of someone he can't quite communicate with.

***** Thanks, I'll check it out. It sounds reasonably plausible to me [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMLzP1VCANo][for instance this guy]]. Though this guy doesn't have all connections severed. Not sure how plausible the emerging disagreement between the halves is.

****** The disagreement seemed quite plausible; both halves wanted to protect themselves (and each other) but were starting with different information and reacting to it in different ways, with their /biggest/ problem being their inability to explain to each other what they were thinking.

*** Terrifyingly I believe it is indeed possible. In researching this I found that postop eeg and ecog indicate continued activity in the other hemisphere. The brain can be quite amazing at recovering, even in cases where it is more than half missing.

On the other hand this procedure is typically done in children with a significantly damaged hemisphere, that may not be capable of thought. Plus I'm not a doctor so who knows.

It does make for some really strange and difficult moral and existential questions.

**** Yeah if one hemisphere can recover then why can't the other? The brain cells are still alive in the other hemisphere, right? Or not?

***** The isolated hemisphere is the more damaged one (since that is where the seizures are originating). So it would be expected to have less function than the connected one, but exactly how much would be case by case. The peri insular functional hemispherectomy leaves pretty much the entire isolated hemisphere intact. It is still alive and active. The procedure seems to be safer and have better outcomes than the more destructive alternatives.

[[https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article-abstract/37/5/975/2758086][or in other words:]]

#+begin_quote
  Overall, peri-insular hemispherotomy can be viewed as a radical hemispheric tractotomy, resulting in a completely disconnected hemisphere. Advantages include shorter operative times, a less stormy postoperative course, and better anatomic preservation of the operated hemisphere, thus presumably reducing long-term complications.
#+end_quote

I don't see any particular reason it couldn't think, though this story does portray a very 'cogent' remaining hemisphere.

******* Says [removed] for me. You might not have much luck since proving consciousness is a bit difficult. Disproving would be more practical, but given that there is brain activity that also might be difficult. Frankly I hope someone can disprove it, because I find it deeply horrifying. Hence writing a story about it (also it fit my criteria for a reveal that was not supernatural and was more horrifying than the mystery).

******** Yeah it was a very good story. Not supernatural but still disconcerting enough to be similar to a supernatural horror in feel.

As for it being removed I forgot to add the neuroscience flair(which I now added), hopefully they'll review it and keep it up.
