Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** What a more "realistic" way to do attributes? In D&D, attributes are divided up into Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. That's pretty much the starting point for a lot of different systems that are used in videogames, but I can't help feeling that it's 1) awfully anthropic and 2) features a lot of things that ought to be interacting, overlapping, and correlated.

The reason I ask is that I'm working on a magic system for a bard type that works on attribute buffing ... but for that to happen, I need to decide what is and isn't an attribute, what falls under their domain as a realistic possibility. This can be fine-grained or chunky, though I suppose I would prefer a "chunky is easy, fine-grained is hard" approach.

Is there a better way of dividing attributes, maybe based on real world biology or psychology? For example, I'm thinking that we could make a "fast twitch muscles" and "slow twitch muscles" division, with each of those being a different attribute, or at least a base to build attributes from. Alternately (or additionally), "aerobic" and "anaerobic".

*** Well at minimum you could just get rid of the Wisdom stat. Since the Wisdom stat is particularly egregious and inconsistent about what Wisdom actually does: For instance in D&D Wisdom determines perception and willpower, yet it's also supposed to represent "wisdom" itself which both makes 0 sense mechanically and because "wisdom" isn't a natural category that can mapped onto a stat in a coherent way.

So I'd recommend splitting up stats like Dexterity and Wisdom into stats like willpower, perception, reaction time, etc which can be coherently defined.

PS: The biggest problem with trying to make an actually accurate attribute system is that attributes should be correlated and having a certain stat in one attribute may require other minimum stats on other attributes (someone who can barely string a sentence together can never be that charismatic for example). The reason this is pretty unwieldy for tabletop RPG's is that things become massively more complex and you can't just treat attributes independently like you normally do.

Isn't this more anthrophic?

There are birds and other animals that communicate without any intelligent, mating dances for example could count as charisma?

**** I think, for the latter objection, I would do some interlocking penalties, assuming it doesn't impede gameplay. I've known people who were charming in spite of not being terribly bright, and people who were very smart but utterly insufferable to everyone, and people who were naturally charming and augmented it with intelligence and insight. So have penalties apply when you're a dullard trying to fast-talk someone clever, for example.

Concur that wisdom is kinda silly. Perhaps replace alignment type values with big five personality traits, which are at least coherent even if I'm not sure how accurate they are scientifically?

*** For mental attributes from a psychology perspective... with working memory, you can further subdivide it into visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, and phonological loop. All of these can be conceptualized as having size/length. You can also think in terms of reaction during recall and false positives/false negative when recalling. But at some level, the metrics we assign to these are more what we can measure than anything underlying. How these metrics arise from underlying neurobiology isn't known though there are various models and hypotheses. Still for the purposes of world building, it does get you distinct cool bardic enhancement: a bard self augmenting their own phonological loop while improvising poetry so they can plan more lines ahead, or enhancing the visuospatial sketchpad of the audience so they can visualize a scene better.

Another way to look at mental enhancement is in terms of stimulating brain regions: target the hippocampus to improve recall, or to block memory formation, target the amygdala to stimulate fear/arousal, target the somatosensory cortex to improve kinesthetic awareness or to create tactile illusions, target prefrontal cortex to enhance self control or to weaken it, etc. From a world building perspective its interesting how mental enhancement, trade off, and detriment are so close together in terms of what magical effect might cause them...

For physical enhancement... you could think in terms of physics, adding force or speed or momentum in some systematic way. From a world building perspective this might be interesting in that it's not a straight enhancement, those under the effect need to practice to utilize it properly.

*** Perhaps the overlap and interaction could just be put into the system? In a RPG that would be a playability issue, but in a video game/story that sort of fine-grained complexity would be fine.

I find the main point of confusion/overlap with attributes is with the mental stuff anyway. The body-related stats (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity) are relatively distinct.

*** Are you trying to stick to attributes tethered to something physical? For a bardic type, it wouldn't be crazy to go with a system that enhances attributes that are more abstract or tethered to something non-physical (meta-physical?).

**** I'm not trying to stick to anything physical, just ... coherent and measurable. In D&D (and other games), your stats map to a lot of things, but that mapping is on the low side of coherence. Something like "Constitution" is nebulous, including things like pain tolerance, immune system, blood clotting, lung capacity, and a bunch of other things that are only mildly related in the real world. It makes sense to cluster them, especially for gameplay, but not when thinking about the mechanisms of function.

At a higher level, I could imagine something like "homeostasis" as a functional cluster, which, if boosted, would assist in regulatory processes within the body somehow, though that cluster is obviously human-derived, since the body is a collection of systems that doesn't "know" what it's doing.

***** This may not be the direction you want to move in, but if you want to avoid making the connection between game-system attributes and mechanisms of function in the real world too murky, you could tie things directly to previous states and history/repetition.

So for any given enhancement you want to make or effect you want to produce, the "attribute" you're enhancing is "how much object X now is like object X was at time T". The effect gets easier to produce if more times T exist that embody the quality you're looking for, and also easier if the gap between X's condition now and X's condition at relevant times T is smaller.

So for example, restoring normal sinus rhythm to a heart in a patient that developed an atrial flutter at age 50 is easy because you have thousands of repetitions of "this heart has a normal sinus rhythm"ness in the past to draw from. But healing an aortic tear is gonna be really hard because the discrepancy between a turn aorta and a healthy one is very large AND because there isn't much "this aorta is growing new tissue to heal from trauma"ness in the past to draw from/enhance.

****** In a D&D-ish environment, this means that special attacks or signature moves that are performed exactly the same way every time are easier to enhance than general combat competence. And that arrows that an archer had used in practice to make many extremely long shots are easier to enhance for similarly long-distance shots, and so on. It also means things that are preserved in very good condition for a very long time are easier to repair and restore than newer things, which is fun for ancient artifacts of great power and such.

***** Make the bard song's effect fundamentally biological then, even if the bard herself doesn't understand it like that.

For example a "constitution" boost might magically duplicate red blood cells, or improve lactic acid cleanup.

*** Why attributes and not abilities? The problem with trying to make attributes into something purely physical is that you're no longer improving abstract attributes, you're just directly making someone's muscles bigger/denser/twitchier. I think it makes more sense to go more abstract instead.

** I have this character who is accidentally made to possess another's body. That other happens to have superpowers, and is living a life that the first prefers greatly over their own. The majority of the story would follow the first character augmenting their new powers, making connections, etc. Then an incident occurs, and they're thrown back into their own body and the other character takes control of theirs again. Morally, the first character doesn't want to steal the second's body again, so emotionally and narratively, it's a setback that's thrown most of their progress throughout the story out the window.

What's the most satisfying way of resolving this so that the reader won't feel like the rest of the story was a waste of time?

*** Put the POV where they'll have to figure out something new and important, so the power loss is just part of the difficulty rather than the key interest. Use an "and also." Like:

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to assemble a heist to rescue their lover, despite not having powers anymore and not looking like their lover expects.

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to persuade the mysterious supervillain who captured them to raise them from prisoner to servant and then trusted lieutenant.

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to break out of the mad scientist's prison-world full of interdimensional secrets.

They lose their powers, /and also/ have to take care of their children, who as part of the same incident acquired their own superpowers but need the POV's guidance to survive the superhero world.

They lose their powers, /and also/ finally see an opportunity to investigate what happened to their old friends, that they never could while they were in the stolen body.

When a stop in power is also a stop in discovery, the reader also stops reading. But when a stop in power opens up a new set of discoveries, that can be golden.

So, figure out new stuff in the world, secrets the reader doesn't yet know or cool feats the hero hasn't yet had to try. Then set up the "power setback" so that, to the reader, it feels like "new discoveries incoming."

*** I'm no writing expert, but I would say do your best to make it about the character not the powers. Focus on how they feel once they have them and once they lose them. This is kind of cliche, but you could have them get dumb and cocky when they have powers, but get smart and solve the problem anyway once they lose them. Not sure if that fits, but that's my general idea. As long as meaningful character growth results I don't think most readers will think it is a waste of time.

**** What if the body stealer saves away something during the stolen time which s/he gets to retain. Or possibly gains critical information which can be leveraged. That can be the perk which makes the body steal worth it. Perhaps there is a super power or upgrade which is coupled to knowledge or techniques...? It depends on the exact world, what is possible on that front

*** Make it more about the character and less about powers. Maybe the body swap has allowed them to learn something about themself. To find reserves of wits or courage they didn't knew they had. Or maybe the time spent in superpowered body resulted in an access to valuable informations.

Just make sure that the character in question grew as a person and learned something during the possession.
