** u/RynnisOne:
#+begin_quote
  “Have to pick.” Learn conceded
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  “Orcs are because of you. We didn't have a say there, either. We are as you made us. /Failed/. ”
#+end_quote

YES.

#+begin_quote
  You hold us back, Free, but I will pull us forward, one at a time, if I have to give up /everything/ to do so.
#+end_quote

*YES*!!!!

Passive no more. I love it. Thank you.

#+begin_quote
  He was no longer an orc.
#+end_quote

LOL, what? He's the orc-iest orc ever to *ORC*. Random Orc: "You are puny, weak. You are no orc!" Learn: "I stood up to our /GOD/, Free, and told him to shove it. What have you ever done with your life?"

** I enjoyed it. It looks like the central conflict is finally being established, which is a large part of what I though was missing from the first few chapters.

One thing that sat oddly: it's strange that Learn omits the "I" from his sentences only when it would begin a new paragraph. New sentences only, I could understand, but new paragraphs is a bit weird.

Other than that, though, it feels like this is finally getting rolling, and I'm excited to see what happens next!
