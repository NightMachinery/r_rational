This is really interesting, and I'm wondering what the community's thoughts on it are. They're basically saying that in order to reconcile emergent disciplines like biology with more fundamental ones like quantum physics, they need to be able to express predictions in terms of what transformations are possible/impossible and not only in terms of initial conditions and laws of motion. What I thought when I read this was: With the whole possible/impossible transformations thing, I mean the word "impossible" just means something has zero probability, vs being "possible" means it has a nonzero amount of probability. This also reminds me a lot of the idea of beliefs/theories/models as anticipation constrainers.

Of course, it also kind of sounds like they're saying that we could never predict the existence of Elephants at time t, that we could only predict that it's possible for them to exist at time t (or perhaps that elephants can exist at time t with a more specific probability). Thoughts?


** One of the main problems with physics is even if we discover the "Theory of Everything" we still won't understand everything. My favourite example of this is: we don't model the behaviour of aeroplanes by calculating every atom in the air, we treat the air as a fluid. The article points out this problem.

What the article does not do is convince me in any way that their method is useful or even correct.

  We are hoping to persuade the scientific community that this is a worthwhile approach by showing that it can solve problems that could not be solved before. That is what we're up to now.

I felt that their description of constructor theory was very lacking and didn't have the feel of an aha moment. Then again maybe Newton's Laws, Einstein's Relativity etc. feel like aha because I know that they're correct (for a given value of correct).

If the explanation was clearer or if they had new results I'd be interested, for now I am doubtful it will lead to anything, I await results.

*** Notes:

- I also feel that their understanding of scientific opinion of evolution may be lacking (a typical physicist, thinks they know all other fields), but being a physics student myself I'm not sure.

- I also believe that we have a reasonable description of quantum thermodynamics including the second law so I'm not certain about that section. But I'm not an expert in that area.

** I may know every law of physics. But this will not tell me how the flower knows when to bloom. That is not a question of physics, but a question of flowers. The flower obeys physics, of course, but physics demands I know the system to predict, and that system is the flower which I do not know.

** I am distrustful of a new way to explain things that is not well explained. It's not like there's a law that whatever constructor theory does has to also work on itself, but absent an explanation of why not, I'm left wondering.

I like the idea of approaching the explanation of science as a thing that could be improved upon. The basic calculus explanation of kinematics - integrate acceleration twice, name the constants, done - is something that wasn't available to Newton. The modern syntax for writing all these equations is much easier than Newton's too, and came much later. I just learned about the [[http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/post/107024697433/more-classical-physics-of-paths][path integral version of this]], which is completely inside out from high school physics, and that's interesting. I think new versions of this sort of explanation are possible - still rigorous mathematics, but perhaps describing the system in terms of a different part of it, and maybe using something outside of what we currently think of mathematical notation.

Categorizing things in terms of what is possible is interesting. I don't think doing it qualitatively gets anywhere - that just becomes a massive list of examples. I think I'd be looking for something like an inequality. For example, f(0) is a comet's purely elliptical, stable orbit. f(x) is the set of all possible paths the comet could take if x energy was applied to it at any point in its orbit. Compare f(x) to e(0), Earth's orbit, and solve for the lowest x where there's a collision. The formal versions of all of these constructs would be very interesting.

I don't know if I'd use a system like that if I was going to try to tackle "does quantum chromodynamics lead to elephants." I think I would be looking for a formalized way to deal with what kinds of abstractions are allowed from more fundamental laws of physics. For things like Newton vs Einstein, we can just plug "v << c" into all the equations and get Newtonian mechanics back out. We're not actually sure exactly how the latest versions of the standard model lead to atoms with a few shells of orbiting electrons, but by the time we scale up to chemistry that approximation is almost always good enough. Why does that work? What's the "v << c" equivalent here, when we're dealing with something that has this many moving parts? Again, I think that's an interesting tool to look for.
