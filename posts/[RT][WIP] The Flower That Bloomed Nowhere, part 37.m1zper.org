In mystery writing, there's sort of a concept of 'layered reveals' where there are basically three stages - when it is /possible/ for the reader to figure out something, when the protagonist/detective figures it out, and finally when it's spelled out directly in the text. Each sort of requires writing in a different frame of mind based on accommodating your whole audience, which is pretty tricky and not something I think many people pull off well. I don't think even I have a handle on it half the time, honestly.

More complicated mysteries will have lots of these little progressions, and not necessarily of the nature of the 3 I described above, but it is good as a general guideline to keep things compelling and sort of create 'difficulty levels' for interacting with your story, instead of just a hard window when they're expected to solve or die. I think the real skill, though, is knowing when to go to that 'third stage' and pull people through, so that you don't end up frustrating readers who just aren't on the same wavelength or are consuming the story more casually.

I'm waffling. Anyway, I'll leave people to interpret for themselves how that applies to this chapter, and what I'm trying to do overall.

If you haven't read this story before, it's a hard fantasy (or soft sci-fi?) murder mystery about immortality. And also some other weird subject matter.


** You know, I can't help but wonder if it was intentional to make Su study a discipline focused on entropy given that her own problem is somewhat 'entropic' in nature as (it seems) her identities are irreversibly mixing together. Even if it had once been possible to separate them out - will it be now?

For example, Su clearly associates more with the person-from-the-flashbacks. On the other hand, I think (but am not 100% sure) that her weird math skills and other general prodigiousness is from the person named Utsushikome (the person from the flashbacks seemed to struggle with academics).

** Wait. Is this an Isekai? *narrows eyes*

Okay this is the first time this work interested me the way the garden where only names grow did.

I am bad at analyzing stories but stuff is starting to make sense to me.

** The obvious meaning of the notes here is that Su has known about this issue since well before the beginning of the story. So now it is being revealed to us.

Though the bit about a scene being not produced for us is very weird. Like I get why the letters might give us the info we need in a better way, but..hmm. Maybe I am over thinking it.
