I usually don't post two of these in a row, but this one has higher than normal ratfic energy and I'm feeling a little down, so a bit more commentary would be nice to keep myself motivated. This is a bit of a slow chapter, in contrast to the one immediately following, which is maybe a bit /too/ dense. It's hope people taking in all the stuff the characters blabber about, because there's very little without a purpose - even if I could probably stand to be more economical in the delivery.

If people haven't read this before, it's a murder mystery about a group of mages trying to achieve immortality. (Part of that description is going to become much more pertinent.)

As always, any feedback on the chapter or the story as a whole is appreciated!


** I really liked this chapter. I've been wondering whether or not the current member expected that they might solve immortality in their lifetime, so I enjoyed learning more about their thoughts on it.

** Caught up again, some thoughts on recent chapters.

The weird geary AI chapter was my favourite. Something about the tone. A vaguely ominous (dopamine?) yet likeable version of "Hey I'm totally not evil!" I'd rate it 10 pitchforks. Lilith seems to have volunteered to be the witch.

Kam's becoming a more interesting character, less predictable I think. Good to see her developing.

Feels like a lot of significant things have been said that have gone over my head. Oh well, hopefully I'll catch onto some of it as the story goes on.
