** Just linking to a blog post by Andrew Rowe where he's giving away the first books in his three book series today only due to celebrating his birthday.

The third book in Arcane Ascension is finally out for pre-order but that's not for another 3 months.

**** I don't remember where the comment was stated, but I asked this to Andrew once and he said that it would possibly be 7-8 books in the Arcane Ascension series alone. It's definitely not going to end as a trilogy at the very least though.

He also said that there is a possibility of more series and books set in this setting beyond the three series we have now.

** I read the first book, was not impressed. All the beats felt very predictable. Better writing than most litrpg I guess, but by the numbers plot, a setting full of recycled tropes, and one dimensional characterization. Somehow he managed to make the typical magic school plot/setting even more banal than usual.

I would have kept reading despite all that but the magic system felt boring and uninspired.

How's the second book?

*** It's been over 2 years since I last read the books and I can't remember the details too well so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I think there was a good chunk of character growth for Corin due to meeting his brother/family drama, the magic system is fleshed out more but not too much more, and there's a lot of detective work in finding out other people's secrets. He's also prepping for the final school exam too. A lot of stuff in the first book ended up being set up for the second book to take advantage of.

The final exam trope got subverted in a very interesting way. So it's not a repeat of the first book's midterm exam.

I'd say that Andrew has avoided the common issue of the second book slump and that it's better than the first book, but if you didn't like the first book, then I can't recommend the second book either.

Sorry if my comment's a bit disjointed. I just typed out anything I could think of to answer your question.

*** I second this. The first book was totally fine and reasonably written, but it didn't seem rational in any meaningful way. It was just another fantasy book with a power progression system. I didn't hate it, but I had little desire to read the second book. Does the series change at all?

**** It is hard fantasy which /can be/ rational adjacent, but my main problem WRT to this being rational is that the MC felt... conveniently intelligent. That is, we're told he is intelligent, but he's only as intelligent as the plot requires, and often the plot requires that he be dumb and ignorant. Inexplicably ignorant for a highly motivated "smart" noble in this setting, but very handy for exposition dumps. Not satisfying at all.

If you didn't like the first book, you probably won't like the second.

That said, I'll respond to a few things.

#+begin_quote
  That is, we're told he is intelligent
#+end_quote

Corin is never referred to as intelligent anywhere in the text. He's written to have some very specific forms of intelligence (lateral thinking, visual memory, rapid arithmetic), while demonstrating gaps in other areas (interpersonal intelligence, linguistic intelligence, memory for any subject that disinterests him). This is how I write characters in general: I prefer characters with intellectual specializations, rather than just being generally "brilliant" all-arounders. More on that in [[https://andrewkrowe.wordpress.com/2018/12/08/writing-intelligent-characters/][this article]].

#+begin_quote
  he's only as intelligent as the plot requires, and often the plot requires that he be dumb and ignorant.
#+end_quote

The gaps in Corin's education are explained in the novel. He was pulled out of school years before the story starts by his abusive father, who 'trained' him exclusively in dueling, to the exclusion of his normal education.

Moreover, some of the things that he "learns" aren't actually new to him, but rather Corin narrating things for the benefit of Keras, a foreigner from a continent with a different magic system, who is part of the audience in the frame story.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Corin is behind in his education due to being pulled out of school years earlier, the victim of years of abuse, and not neurotypical.

I recognize that these elements did not come through to all readers clearly enough in the first book, and the second book makes some of them much more apparent, especially that Corin was physically abused, his lack of education, and that he is explaining certain things for the benefit of a foreigner in the frame story.

All that being said, if you didn't like the overall style of the first book, you will very likely dislike the second book as well. Corin's way of thinking is deliberately very specialized, and if you don't like his style of thought process, you probably won't like anything where he's the narrator.

****** It's mentioned a few times that he's in the top 200ish in his division out of ~1500, so I would call that implicit mentions of his intelligence, even if other characters don't directly state it. At various other points he's shown that he does very well compared to other students, top 10% or so. I would characterize it as the author saying he's intelligent even if the characters don't.

Admittedly, he probably spends a lot more time doing school stuff compared to other students who probably have things like active social lives and/or hobbies, and school is hardly a perfect measure of intelligence.

******* I think looking at his overall grades actually supports my point, since you can see that his performance varies drastically from class to class, and his overall grade is a 'B', which isn't exactly exceptional.

Moreover, the classes themselves demonstrate that intelligence isn't the primary factor in grades. Corin's highest grade comes from mana manipulation, which is a result of repeated practice of a very specific skill set and having two attunements with synergistic power sets, not intelligence. He also has classes that relate to other things entirely, like Physical Combat.

Was he supposed to be intelligent? lol. I don't actually remember even being told he was intelligent and he certainly didn't do anything that could be called clever. He had a magic specialization that should have been geared towards planning ahead and preparing enchanted items for expected future difficulties... and he never really used it. The many fights and challenges he faced all appeared to be surprises to him, and he managed wins through luck and some vague amount of combat savviness, not through any actual insight or thinking or planning.

Anyway, not sure I need to say so much just to agree with you. It annoyed me how little the main character seemed to be engaged in actual thought or any real effort to solve the challenges he faced is all.

If you didn't like the first book, you probably won't like the rest, either.

That said, a few quick replies.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

He's never called intelligent in the book.

He's supposed to demonstrate very specific forms of intelligence, while showing gaps in other areas. In terms of "cleverness", that's really very subjective. More on that in this article.

Most of Corin's moves that I would consider "clever" are small, subtle things, like:

- Taking the time to loot some of the apparent attunement-granting water from the last room of the Judgment
- Taking notes in areas where he suspects his memory may be wiped later
- Designing an item specifically to measure safe mana capacity to work around his own fear of overusing his mental mana
- Deliberately overloading Jin's shield sigil to make it explode
- Figuring out how Derek's compulsion works and forcing him to recite the plot to a novel series while fighting
- Etc.

Because they're being presented to the reader in a constrained narrative with foreshadowing, they may seem extremely obvious. That's one of the dangers of writing with a lot of foreshadowing: it's harder to make specific points come across as clever for a protagonist when they've already been advertised as being possible.

That said, these things were largely written because of how many books where they /don't/ happen. I've read hundreds of magic systems with serious costs for mana overuse, but I can't recall a single instance of another character inventing a mana watch to measure their mana and prevent them from going beyond safe values, even if there are plenty of other stories where that /would/ have been relevant.

I hope that makes sense.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The opening line of the book is, "It was the day of my Judgment, and I was prepared in a thousand ways that didn't matter."

This is a major theme for Corin: his specialized preparation for his Judgment was essentially useless (his father was really just abusing him), leaving him with a risk-averse mentality. His response to this early on is to focus on enchantments that are almost exclusively generalized rather than specialized and defensive in nature.

For this reason, most of his enchantments in the first book are things that are either designed to solve his personal problems that are keeping him from more enchanting, like the mana watch<! or items like >!improved shield sigils for his entire group, which are generally useful in virtually any situation.

He's also extremely resource starved and doesn't really know what he's doing yet. He does a /lot/ more enchanting in the second book, but it's still mostly general-purpose enchantments, rather than situational ones.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I suspect that part of the issue here is that you were expecting a character with a focus on situational preparation: that isn't Corin, for the reasons I stated above. He tends to build his enchantments for the possibility that /anything/ could go wrong, then rapidly adapt his combat tactics based on what happens. He builds his skill set more clearly in this direction in the sequel.

******** The audio always takes a bit longer than the other formats, since the narrator can't start recording until the book's text is finalized, the narrator has to find time, and production (editing, etc.) always takes some time. We definitely want the audio out as quickly as possible after the Kindle format, but it's probably going to be at least a few more months.
