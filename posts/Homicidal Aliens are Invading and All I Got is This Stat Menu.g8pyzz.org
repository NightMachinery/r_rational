** First off, I find this story very engaging and I suspect others here will as well, which is why I'm recommending it.

As to the question of its rationality, it's got some interesting contrasts. The characters behave in very believable ways, but not optimal ways -- they pick powers quickly and without spending hours on it, because they want to play with the fun toys. Anya (the MC) thinks to ask smart questions of her AI but does not phrase them as carefully as she should. The powers she chooses are sensible for her immediate future and for the kind of person she is, but they aren't the most optimal thing overall. She comes up with good battle tactics (I'm specifically thinking about the Hawaii fight) and even thinks ahead to questions of collateral damage and civilian casualties.

One of the problems of rational fiction is that it's too easy for it to fall into competence porn, where the MC never makes a single mistake. Authors have incentives for that -- every time your characters don't do the globally optimal thing, some readers will write in to say "Your characters are stupid and this isn't Rational Fiction and I'm dropping the story!!1!!" This story does a good job examining how people would probably actually behave in these circumstances, with all the rushed decisions and cached thoughts that real people exhibit, followed by making the most that they can out of their powers. There is some exploration of how governments would respond to these situations, and the characters feel very real.

It's definitely not rational/ist/ fiction, I'm sure some people will say that it's not rational fiction, but I think it belongs on this sub as an example of how to do people properly instead of perfectly.

*** How is it abandoned? It updated two days ago and there's not author's note at the end of the most recent chapter to indicate that it's anything but active.

**** The author put out a note with chapter 02.01.08 where they said the story did not achieve the goals they wanted it to and they were going to finish out the volume then end it. Just a minute ago, chapter 02.01.15 came out and the note at the end says that's the last one.

**** Meh. The instant the author was all "screw this I'm out" and straight up said he wasn't even going to give it a real ending but planned to just drop it like a rock, I felt no compulsion to ride it til it sank, y'know?

***** I enjoyed the first part and that's a pretty complete story which I considered worth reading. I do find it bizarre that he actually had another month (?) of chapters written and provided them to people on Patreon but decided that it'll never be posted publicly.

Sounds to me like he was unhappy that a lot of stories with obvious shortcomings are doing better on Royalroad and the Patreon never took off. I'm a real believer that the best thing to do is persevere and wait for one or two "big breaks" where the story starts to gain a critical mass of readers, but hey. He gave it a good shot for a while.

****** I think the story is a pretty good read, but the +petulant+ frustrated author's note also killed my interest in reading the last few chapters.

The wordcount is currently ~334,000 which is roughly 1/4 of the length of Worm. Seems a bit premature to call it a failure, but then again the Royal Road ecosystem does move pretty quickly.

******* I'm with you... kind of sounds like he expected to write decent fiction for a year and be pulling in serious money. There's a lot of luck and/or self-promotion involved in the authors who are successful, it's not just a matter of throwing chapters out there for a year and expecting to have it be a big hit. If he just thought the premise/characters weren't going to be a winner it would've been smarter to try to wrap up book two and pivot his readers directly to a new story.

On the other hand, I can understand being demoralized that there's a lot of pretty terrible writing doing better on Royalroad and maybe there's some pandemic-related depression in there too.

******** Hello! I'm JayAck aka the guy who writes/wrote "Homicidal Aliens." I know my user name here is different. I can provide proff somehow if somebody needs it.

Anyway! Dunno if anybody was looking for a response but I figured I'd try anyway.

*First:* if you've read my story, thank you. 2019-2020 was a bit of a rough year for me for a number of unrelated reasons, and even though my story didn't take off as much as I'd hoped, it still did a lot better than some of my more pessimistic expectations, and I've got people like you to thank for the success I did get. Even though I've hit the brakes on the story, it's been very important to me that at the very least, my readers are aware that I am hugely grateful to them.

*Second*: The decision to stop the story wasn't a knee-jerk reaction. I started in April of 2019 between jobs but with a part-time job lined up that would allow me more time to write and maybe try my hand at this Patreon thing. But, if I didn't hit some goals over the course of 6-12 months, I'd pack it in, at least for the time being.

This decision wasn't made to be "petulant," or because of other authors, or whatever. It was made because I made a contract with myself and wasn't able to justify the time/energy the story required (more on this later). I didn't see other authors as competition and I've supported many of them this past year by either joining their Patreon, giving them money through PayPal/ Ko-Fi, or buying stuff they have online. Success isn't a limited commodity and I'm a firm believer that--especially in smaller genres like LitRPG--one person's success is good for everybody in the long run. I've never once felt another author did not deserve their success.

*Third*: I am regretting not calling this an "indefinite hiatus," as that would be more appropriate, especially given some things that have happened since I made the initial announcement. A publisher has contacted me about buying publishing rights for my story, and I've received quite a few messages lamenting the loss of future chapters so...

I dunno. I had what I felt were modest and realistic expectations for my story, and failing to meet any of them was a bit of a downer, and my timeframe for devoting myself in the way I'd like has passed.

On the other hand, "Homicidal Aliens," is several times larger than anything else I've written and has also gotten more traction than anything else I've done and it does seem a shame, given the feedback, to stop here.

So I might post an announcement or something clarifying and leaving the door open instead of closed.

Regardless, it really does mean a lot that folks I've never met showed interest and investment (whether that took the form of donating or just reading new chapters and enjoying them), and as always, I listen to my audience and take their thoughts, feelings, and criticisms to heart.

Thanks so much, and please stay safe and take care of yourselves,

~JayAck
