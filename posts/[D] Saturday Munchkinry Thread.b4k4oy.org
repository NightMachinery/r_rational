Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Just finished watching the Netflix adaptation of /The Umbrella Academy/. It was... decent, though I did feel characters held on to their idiot balls a bit too often, and certain aspects of their powers felt inconsistent. As usual, the abilities of the main cast felt underused. How would you munchkin any of the following? The universe contains any required secondary properties to make these work, but otherwise appears to be very similar to our own.

*MINOR SPOILERS BELOW, BUT NOTHING PAST THE FIRST EPISODE REALLY*

(I'm also going with the show versions, since the comic versions have extra stuff)

#1. Luther Hargreeves -- super strength, capable of casually throwing a grown man dozens of feet through a window

#2. Diego Hargreeves -- capable of throwing objects with excellent precision, curving them around obstacles mid-flight

#3. Allison Hargreeves -- capable of seemingly unbounded mind-control of other humans, so long as the command is heard audibly and takes the form: "I heard a rumor... [command]"

#4. Klaus Hargreeves -- capable of communicating with the dead by summoning a their spirit, with limited control of who is summoned. Only he can see and hear the spirit, and it cannot interact with the physical world except through these two channels

#5. Number Five -- capable of teleportation of self and held/worn items, with an unknown range. No issues with matching the earth's rotational velocity etc. etc. Can also travel through time with limited control.

#6. Ben Hargreeves -- capable of summoning eldritch abominations from his torso in the form of tentacles that slap things around.

--------------

The time travel component of #5 seem the least taken advantage, through that might be attributed to a lack of control. Otherwise, it seems like #3 failed the hardest -- in universe, she's ok with non-consensual use of her power on 'innocents', and uses it to propel herself to movie stardom, rather than, say, political or industrial domination. People seem to know her history as a super-powered crime fighter, and yet don't take any precautions against non-consensual mind control when interacting with her.

Instead, I feel she'd have been able to make a much broader impact on the world through consensual therapy. Her powers don't appear to exhaust her -- at least not beyond the exhaustion brought about by talking -- and their effects are never shown to fade through time, or be limited in complexity (though they do seem psychological in nature -- no /rumors/ can warp reality, afaict). A better use of them imo would be to coordinate with an extensive team of capable psychotherapists to create a conveyor belt of patients desiring behavioral change and explicitly willing to submit to "rumor" treatment (and willing to pay $$). As each one passes, you tell them you'd heard a rumor that they were no longer addicted to X, or their mental diseases were cured, or they'd searched deep within themselves and found the willpower to procrastinate less and with greater dedication pursue their goals, etc. Hell, she could provide explicit commitments between consenting parties as a contract enforcement mechanism! She could serve as a marriage counselor! Sky's the limit, and you'd exhaust your own time before drying the well of prospective clients, even restricting yourself to the wealthy (say, ~$10k per treatment? half of which goes to overhead, your team, etc. and half to you?)? Treating, say, 100 people per hour would net you millions USD per day, far beyond what a mere movie star would make.

#1 and #2 otherwise seen perfect for competitive sports, so long as you can keep the supernatural aspects of the power hidden and unbanned. #4 would be world-changing just as demonstrable evidence for an afterlife, and people would likewise flock for seance services (if not for personal reasons, then for e.g. estate management). #6, I guess, could be used for reverse engineering? idk

*** Funny enough, in the comics Allison's power /was/ reality warping, e.g. telling JFK "I heard a rumor that the back of your head is about to explode." Which is obviously much more exploitable than in the show.

** You have the power to become grant patronage to people. You have the ability to always be able to point out where your subjects are by looking at a map, and within a distance proportional to the number of subjects you can view through the senses of your subjects and telepathically communicate with them. Within the same range you can grant minor buffs to your subjects: allow them to move faster, become more resilient, become nimbler, and become mentally quicker, and additionally you can trade places of two subjects a few times/day. Only a certain fraction of your subjects can receive buffs at the same time and it is physically exhausting for you to have buffs running exponentially correlated to the number of active buffs. You have no particular control of your subjects and a subject can at any point reject your patronage.

What are some clever uses of this kind of power?

*** You could market snake-oil style products which purport to increase your strength/speed/mental agility. Actually, you would only buff random customers (upto your max capacity) who have great social media following who could vouch for your products. Then reap the rewards.

I'm assuming patrons are unaware that they have been granted patronage.

This is definitely exploitable as it gives the power of life and death over the subjects. If you can grant patronage without close physical proximity, it would make you one of the most dangerous people in the world due to being able to credibly threaten anyone. And it gets /much/ more dangerous with some abuse of physics.

Swapping a 100KG subject with a 50KG subject surrounded by solid matter would result in 50KG of subject occupying the same space as the solid matter. Solids and liquids are only very slightly compressible, e.g. water at the bottom of the Marianas trench is only a few percent denser than at surface level. Instantaneously increasing pressure to levels closer to that at the center of the earth will result in a furiously hot ball of matter expanding outwards in all directions at supersonic speeds. Undetectable, unpreventable mass murder. The first subject survives and the second subject / human bomb wouldn't need to be a willing participant.

Additionally, the matter of the second subject will be locally positioned at random with respect to the liquid/solid matter surrounding the first subject rather than in a stable minimum energy state. As a result, some fraction of the atoms will overcome the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_barrier][Coulomb Barrier]] and undergo fusion. The hard radiation and additional energy output will not make things better for anyone in the vicinity. It might even be possible to use a pair of subjects as the core of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_fusion_weapon][pure fusion weapon]], making you a nuclear superpower.

*** How much faster, nimbler, etc. do subjects become? And how many subjects can you buff before your baseline state of exhaustion becomes equivalent to, say, 36h sleep deprivation? My first inclination would be to become a professional (football?) coach, and maybe also attribute the boost to some special (100% legal!) sauce, a weaker version of which can be purchased for the low low price of $99.99, as the other comment suggests. Plus side here is you only need to be boosting targets during games, and maybe during some of the practices. Otherwise if the boost transforms the ordinary into superhuman, get some confidants in on the action and have the cut you some of that sponsorship money.

Swapping subjects could be useful for e.g. relieving astronauts of their shifts, or else selling intercontinental transportation services to busy, wealthy people.

**** Let's say 10% increase. Choose one area to buff is equivalent to light exercise which most people people can do comfortably for what? 4 hours a day and could probably be trained up to 10 hours?. For every other buff active the strain is doubled and thus your time is halved.

Good ideas.

***** 10% doesn't seem measurable in everyday life. You might feel good with a physical buff, but you'd have to go to the gym and compare your best effort to see it in effect.

I suppose that's one such exploit you could munchkin: at the top levels of sport, where athletes are using years of training and the best genetics to eke out improvements of milliseconds over others who are also near the peak levels of natural human performance, you could be a kingmaker. Sports betting could make you a lot of money, which is its own superpower.

*** My subjects can reject my patronage, but do they have to accept it or can I just declare them as my subjects? If I can just declare them, then the first thing that I can do is simply declare the entire population of Earth to be my subjects. Now, over a very large distance, I can telepathically communicate with and look through the eyes of anyone I want; this is extremely munchkinable, especially if I see through the eyes of (say) someone looking at secret documents.

If, on the other hand, I need them to accept the idea of being my follower in at least some sense, then the best thing to do is to create a twitter account and work on getting as many twitter followers as possible.

--------------

If I count as one of my own subjects for teleportation purposes, then I can also arrange for holidays abroad whenever I want - I just need to find someone in the target country who wants a holiday here without having to pay for transport.

** I'm poking at a character-concept, whose eyes and visual processing have been significantly improved; how many further complications come to your mind from adding a pile of channels to the standard human RGB?

Humans only think they can see colours. Sure, I mean, technically, they can. Three channels of colour information, meaning that when they're mixed and matched, they've got three primary and three secondary colours, which can be brighter or darker, plus 'everything' and 'nothing' (that is, 'white' and 'black'), for six shades. (Ignore Newton's alchemical attempt to split off indigo from purple, which has annoyed schoolchildren for centuries.) Put another way, 2^{3} = 8, minus 2 for black and white, equals 6. When I open /my/ eyes, I have /eight/ such channels, giving me 2^{8} -2 = 254 colours, each as distinct to me as orange is from green. When I push, I have 4 more, giving my brain 2^{12} - 2 = 4094 separate and distinct colours, any of which can be brighter or darker, or crossed with another colour into something equivalent to turquoise.

It took me a while to figure out how my visual system worked, in terms of grade-school physics. But for the sake of this story, to avoid confusing any listeners, I'm describing a few things that took me years to figure out. To start with, only six of my primary colours can be seen on a rainbow: yuve (aka UV, aka ultraviolet), blue, green, red, near (aka NIR, aka near infrared), and fir (aka FIR, aka far infrared). The seventh of my passive channels is polarization; the eighth is bizarre enough that for a long time I called it 'ghost', and still think of it that way. It only works if a particular light source, like sunlight or a fire, is shining both on what I'm trying to look at, and on the crystal in my forehead; and if there's something blocking my direct view, like a wall or a cloud; and if whatever it is casts some shadows that aren't completely blocked from my view. It's sort of like being able to see ghosts through solid walls, thus the name.

If I push my mind in certain ways, then I can see up to four more channels. One is sonar - and yes, I know that it's made from sound from my nasal cavities that bounce into my ears, but my brain /interprets/ the results in its visual centres. So I can 'see' with my ears, even if I'm wearing a blindfold. It's handy, in its way, because it takes less effort than the other three, which I am reliably informed are organic forms of lidar, terahertz-range radar, and radio-range radar. My forehead-crystal is heavily involved in emitting the lidar and t-rays, and most of my head in the radar. If I go all out, then I'm told that the effort produces an extra 75 watts of heat, compared to the 80 watts a typical body produces just when lying down. It's a lot less than the thousand watts a sprinting human can produce, but it's all generated in my head, right next to my brain; and even though my neurons don't seem to suffer all the limits that purely evolved organisms have to deal with, it's still a pain - occasionally literally. Part of 'looking hard' triggers my upper heart to beat harder, and a lot of my cranial arteries and veins to expand, pushing a lot more blood through, carrying the heat away; and my fore-lungs to pump independently of my hind-lungs, switching from being bird-like air-sacs to heat-exchangers, as I start panting. Some more of the heat I sweat out, and some is directly radiated by my ears, but most gets dumped in a bladder-like organ in my foretorso, about where a human might expect to find a liver.

In extreme situations, my body squeezes that bladder, shooting some of the over-hot liquid out my mouth, dumping the heat far away from me. Oh, and this is probably the best time to mention that my incisors contain enough piezoelectric crystals to spark when I gnash them together - just enough of a spark to ignite the liquid from my heat-bladder.
