Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Bird brains are more efficient at thinking than most mammalian brains, so Crossbreed a crow and a human to make a superintelligence. Maybe for the second generation crossbreed the result with a dolphin/octopus hybrid that also emphasizes intelligence, just to see what's up. Of these, I would be most worried about the octopus brain, because all the other animals are pack animals, while octopoid are solitary predators. If there's any hints of problems in the youngest stages of life with cooperative advancement, then probably terminate the experiment before it gets smart enough to manipulate me or engineer my death. I dunno, I guess with the other portion of the power you could just "slowly" encourage intelligence in humans and discourage more destructive behaviors without the threats of alien intelligences having different objectives or morality.

** You are on your "+loading+ character creation screen", about to be reincarnated in a generic medieval fantasy setting (although with realistic psychology / consequences / etc).

What you see, before actually being born, looks like the satellite version of Google Earth --- except:

- it's in real time and also feeds you human hearing-range sound;
- you can zoom enough to see inside most of the buildings (some have strong enough magical protections to negate your scrying, but they are very rare);
- all speech / faces / facial expressions / texts / pictographs are incomprehensible to your mind;
- you can see highlighted outlines for all the available-for-choice "vessels" --- unborn children that haven't yet developed a "soul" of their own (which happens the moment they are born) or haven't yet been chosen as vessels by other reincarnators.

There are enough other reincarnators like you that, approximately, .01% of the vessels end up becoming hosts for reincarnators. There doesn't seem to be any time limit on how long you can drag your feet and keep staying on your character creation screen, although you haven't received any instructions or warnings either, so you can't be sure there won't be any negative consequences for waiting too long.

Your preliminary goals after incarnating will be to 1) ensure your basic needs; 2) become as influential as possible by the end of your 35th birthday.

Question: How do you go about deciding which child you want to be incarnated into?

*** Optimal choice is to be the only child of the most powerful country's king and queen.

But now we have a problem: with so many other reincarnators, there will be uplifts happening everywhere. People spreading the recipes for gunpowder, cement, hot air balloons, etc. Spreading scientific knowledge all over. There will be chaos and an arms race.

The natives are going to realize there are reincarnators in their midst, especially since some reincarnators will see no problem with blabbing about their origins. There will be hatred and discrimination. Reincarnators will be kidnapped and interrogated for knowledge, or burned at stake for being demons.

This makes (2) pretty annoying to achieve, because becoming greatly influential greatly increases the probability of becoming suspected of being a reincarnator.

If you manage to incredibly luckily find very loving and and open-minded and powerful royal parents, the good path is to set up a safe fortress for reincarnators to live in... but they won't accept you as leader because democracy.

The evil path is to kidnap and interrogate other reincarnators, and pass off any reincarnator knowledge you have as knowledge extracted from your captives... but this will make other reincarnators hate your guts and want to kill you.

Either way, trying to achieve (2) will be a extremely bloody and messy path.

And this is assuming there is no way to combine modern scientific knowledge with magic to achieve utterly game breaking powers. Like von Neumann self replicators. Or time travel.

*** Look for signs of wealth.

Large land. A huge house decorated with artwork. (But not if it's too close to extreme poverty - I want someone who /won't/ starve his own son to save another coin for his overflowing vaults). Ideally, I'd want parents who are wealthy and already have exactly one healthy child; I wouldn't be the main heir, but the second-to-inherit is still a good position to be in (without attracting nearly as much hostile attention as the main heir).

Wealth is an excellent way to ensure both that my needs are met and that I'm in a good position to launch a bid for Influence once I've got a better idea of how this world works.

** You have the power to apply [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism][lamarckian evolution]] to plant and animals you work with and breed. For instance, if you dye a bunch of mices fur pink, their offspring will be born with pink hair. The resulting adaption/mutation in the offspring must be vaguely biologically plausible. So any dye color will work for mice, surgical alterations will work, training them to be smarter/stronger will work, but outright cybernetic implants won't be properly inherited. You have an intuitive mental control over what lamarckian traits you want passed on.

You also have the power to crossbreed life. This power is most reliable (no miscarriages) when breeding within taxonomic Class or below separations (i.e. birds with birds, mammals with mammals, reptiles with reptiles), but with a slight rate of miscarriages it is possible to achieve across Classes (reptiles with mammals, birds with mammals, etc.). With a high rate of miscarriages and failures, you can achieve extreme cross breeds across entire phylum: fungi with animals for example. You can use this power with artificial insemination, so you don't have to figure out the logistics of cross species mating

You have intuitive mental control over what mix of traits are passed on and how they combine. So crossbreeding an eagle and a lion could give you a hairy bird, or a quadruped with feathers, or a hexapodal griffin depending on what you wanted. Size can be anywhere in the range of the two species, but they still need to be born, so to avoid fetal deaths from splitting the mother open, you need to make the mother the larger one in the case of extreme size difference. For biological features that depend on particular size scales (minimum brain sizes, square cube law, flight), you can cheat biology and physics by around a factor of around 2-8. So you could make a flying creature around two times as big as its parent bird that can still fly in spite of physics. Or a hybridize human intelligence and vocal chords onto an animal and still have human level intelligence with only 1/2, or pushing it with a few failures, 1/4 the brain size. Note I have been a bit ambiguous with size: length vs. total mass (2x length is 8x mass)... you can push the exact limits by tweaking the trait to compromise with physics a bit more: giving disproportionately large wing span to the flying creature for example.

You can draw a set of circles with symbols with symbols around them. By placing a physically immature life-form in the center circle as well as raw biomass, an electrical terminal, detailed written instructions on how you would have trained the life form as it aged, and various nutritional supplements in the outer circles, you can perform a ritual that rapidly grows, matures, and trains the life-form to adulthood drawing a huge amount of electrical power and raw material in the process. The biomass is about equivalent to how much food the lifeform would have eaten as growing and the electricity used is about how much energy its metabolism would have used growing up, so this process is very expensive even if it is time saving for long lived lifeforms. You have an intuition for how much power and raw material is required as well as how detailed the instructions have to be.

To leverage these powers, you can mentally influence (and with enough focus outright control) up to dozen lifeforms at once. You must be in line-of-sight range to establish control and can maintain control as long as you stay focused, or maintain influence with just the occasional thought. With humans and similarly intelligent life, you have issues with precise fine control and maintaining even loose influence. Influencing and controlling lifeforms you have created is easier than natural lifeforms.

Traits you have bred through lamarckian evolution or hybridization breed true without your continued influence after just one generation, even if they have to cheat physics to work.

So what ultimate life form will you create? What utility lifeforms might you make? How might you accumulate resources in the early stages of bootstrapping this power?

Mild: Make super crops that grow quickly and are resistant to everything you can think of. Maybe farm for a few months for starting capital, then sell seeds for more money. Solve world hunger in the process.

Medium: Breed immortal jellyfish with humans, transferring their immortality trait onto humanity.

Megalomaniacal: Break physics and biology by letting your crossbreed plants produce biomass ex nihilo. Pretty sure this is possible under the given rules. This is incredibly awesome for turning humanity into an intergalactic civilization, because you are no longer bound by planets. You can just keep growing more and more plant biomass in space, practically Von Neumann style. Then you can eat/drink them for nutrition, burn them for energy, crossbreed them with animal blood cells to get iron production for building more spacecraft, etc.

​

On the other hand, if you ever lose containment, things will go REALLY BAD. If those plants spread all over the earth, producing mass ex nihilo, that means the Earth's mass keeps increasing, gravity keeps increasing, and soon it will be uninhabitable.

How... ahh the 2x to 8x cheat. Breed plants that store large amount of water with plants that are super efficient on water needs and you can get 2 to 8 times as much water out as you put in. Do the same for plants efficient on micronutrient needs and plants that need lots of exotic nutrients for trace elements.

  iron production for building more spacecraft
#+end_quote

You don't even need iron for spacecraft if you get really ambitious with your Von Neumann plants. The plants initial structure and body are derived from really ambitious crossbreeding of fast growing plants and vacuum resistant organisms and durable organisms/plants. With a bit of lamarckian direction of growth you could get an O'Neil cylinder type of design with internal perpetual energy from bio-luminescence. Its thrust could come from out-gassing ex-nihlio created gasses. Lamarck a generation of humans to be adapted to living under spin-g and bioluminescence and to be good at orbital calculations and station maintenance. Actually, your post-humans could be adapted for zero-g.

To avoid green-goo scenarios, game what counts as one organism. The primary mass-energy conservation breaker should be one big super organisms that needs human (or post-human) guidance to bud, and the various supporting symbiotic organisms should be bred to need a light touch of human maintenance and not to break mass-energy conservation too hard themselves. The entire primary von-neuman super organism should be lamarcked to have a central control unit that humans can use to influence long-term flight direction by controlling the out-gassing and such.

*** Step 1: Overcoming weaknesses. First weakness: reliability and genetic distance. The failure rate of a given lifeform is proportional to the 'distance' the two parents have from each other and the 'intensity' of the change. Thus, if you're guaranteed at least SOME success at a high risk of failure, you minimize the cost of failure.

My first goal is some sort of axolotl chamber. (see Herbert's Dune, although I wouldn't use human women). A lifeform grown specifically to grow other life forms. As this is the basis of the next stages, we can afford some early testing failures.

I feel like there are a couple of directions you can go depending on which branch of the tree of life you pick, and what your specific goal is for the life forms in question. You'd probably want a few different options to keep your path broad.

So you could have a sort of large placental creature that is basically just a giant uterus. Over a couple of generations you refine some mammalian source such that the brain and nervous system atrophy, and only those nerves required for gestation and the associated digestive and metabolic systems remain.

No organism exists in a vacuum. (Metaphorically. By the time we're done they'll be able to do so literally.) We are all products of our environments, and our environments are products of us.

So we need an artificial ecosystem. But as we're cronenbergian horror villains, we're going to grow our own in a creepy wet basement or sewer somewhere.

So, we start at the bottom of the ecosystem. By tapping into the city's sewer line, we have basically an uninterrupted and untraceable source of biomass and other chemicals. We can even do good deeds by purifying the water out of the waste if we want.

So we build a filter feeding system. Bacterial mats with enhanced metabolic rates help us break down the waste into component parts, and they are held by long strands of algal netting to become a sort of living biofilter. Like a giant aquarium. But that's just the bottom of the pyramid. Purpose made harvesters will gather the bacterial mats and feed them into the digesters, where they will be broken down into basic nutritional components.

The digesters, of course, being purpose bred 'stomachs' sourced from bacteriophagic sea creatures that over the course of a few generations have similar neural atrophy etc.

The basic gist is that we can turn flora and fauna into plumbing. Need pipes? Grow some lampreys until they're six inches around and fifty feet long. They bite onto the side of a digester and begin 'pumping' the slurry out and to the other end, where it an be deposited where it needs to go.

In similar fashion, we can basically create unlimited source materials to feed into our axolotl tanks.

A hive structure such as those built by hymenoptera is another option. Bees grow in larval chambers in the comb. Starting with bees is a path you can use for invertebrate minions, which will save on failure rates. The placental axolotl tanks are for mamalian/reptilian types.

So we've now got a steady base of operations and a way to generate minions with more reliability. I'm going to assume this can be integrated with the rituals described. The 'immature' lifeform is in its axolotl tank in the center of the circle, connected to the artificial ecosystem network. The training instructions are fed in digitally, in the form of AI trained by adversarial networks and genetic algorithms.

So what's next? I suppose power, if actual electric power is required. Biological processing is hyper-efficient compared to anything people can build, but we'll still need quite a lot of energy if we're going to force-grow minions.

Electric eels can generate ~500w for a very short time, but we're going big here. We can stack up and super-charge a biological power-wall. A living battery pack that converts metabolism into electricity. Plug it into the artificial bio network. Now we've got the lights on!

OK, so at this point we're basically living 'inside' a composite living organism the size of a building.

We can integrate all kinds of biology, using biomimicry, genetic editing, and of course good old surgery to put whatever traits we want in.

One idea I had is an ant-queen trained to control her swarm based on mental commands. The swarm of ants aren't normal ants though.

They are architect ants. Ants the size of cinderblocks with heavy armor plating. The ants can link their armor together, and will feed each other by trophallaxis indefinitely. So with a thought, your building's internal structure itself can move and change, because it too is alive. The ants provide the walls and floors and scaffolding, and hold the infrastructure of the base together safely. And in an instant they can be cinder-block sized heavily armored ants that respond to your mental commands.

The vibe is basically 'everything is alive'. The car is alive. It looks like a sports car but the hood is a beetle elytra and it's organs underneath. The house is alive. The doors are made of chitin and wood and the hinges are knuckles.

But it all looks like ordinary stuff. It's hidden in plain view. Overnight there's a new warehouse in the old industrial district and nobody notices. the Sewage treatment plant reports increases in water quality.

Now we're established and we can do whatever we want. I like the idea of protecting the city by growing it bit-by bit to be alive. Replace things a bit at a time with organic replicas wherever possible. Street lights made of coral with bio luminescent glands. Jersey barriers that brace for impact and catch cars softly.

The city is alive, and the people are its cells and I am its mind and we will defend ourselves if we have to.

*** Creating /a/ singularity with this is trivial. Making it /aligned/ and corrigible is even harder than for an AI. What you really want to to is enhance your own personal intelligence, but none of the examples like toxoplasma or cordyceps actually work in a way that lets you add computational power.

Horrifically, I think what you'd need to use is the way transmissible cancers become distinct organism lineages, breed that with neural stem cells you fiddle around with lamarkialy in vitro until they become sufficiently organism-like, breed that with toxoplasma... and then you're finally getting somewhere, and can start injecting it in the brains of mice and experiment around to find something that will grow and enhance their intelligence, but not kill them or cause to much insanity. Traits from lichen, male anglerfish, Sacculina parasites (experts in having a large amount of tissue in the host for a long time without killing it), etc. might be useful.

Then you do another round to increase potency; human traits for brain architecture, corvid to modify that for more efficiency, bee for neuron size to fit more in etc. Also, labrador retriever for personality, ants for coordination ability and altruism, and whale for whatever traits are needed to scale and supply a brain to much larger than human. Then it's time to inject yourself.

Then you work on the alignment problem in a way that can't really take advantage of the powers directly.

One thing you'd probably do once you're sufficiently confident they wont be able to "catch up" intelligence-wise is combine ants, ducks, and dogs to make an animal that will imprint on your scent and act in an eusocial submissive role, fix the loyalty in on being always you by taking it as a lamarckian trait, and then reinforce that for a few generations until you can add it to humans to make scientists immutably and perfectly loyal to you, and with the coordination abilities and mutual altruism and loyalty of social insects. Then add the size (mainly brain volume) of whale/elephant, and neuron size of bees, and a lamarckian-transferred copy of these biology powers since those are an acquired trait. And again, whatever you can in terms of personality to make them extremely altruistic, friendly, and submissive.

*** First I would get a pet axolotl and cut it and dismember it repeatedly to improve it's regeneration abilities and pull it and stretch it as well as cutting it open and pulling and stretching it's reproductive organs specifically to enlarge them faster until it is large enough to survive birthing a human child. I would then breed it with immortal jellyfish and then breed tardigrades and mentally control them to make them stretch themselves and each other until I have ones big enough to breed with the giant axolotl jellyfish.

I would then breed sugarcane (for its capability to convert an extremely large amount of sunlight into chemical energy) with psychedelic mushrooms and aphrodisiac herbs. I would then selectively breed these plant/fungi to make them spew spores as far as possible so that once they're inhaled the victim will see the producers of those spores as extremely sexually attractive and have their vision of their appearance distorted by psychedelics. (Ideally I would want the effect to be that the victim sees the producer as the person that they love but I don't know how I'd do that. Let me know if you know)

Now that the sugarcane mushroom hybrid is a fungi rather than a plant it is less likely to fail when I breed it with my giant axolotl (assuming fungi is considered closer to animal than plant is but even if it isn't I can afford to fail as much as necessary).

I would then lure 12 men from all over the world to my home by pretending to be in love with them, when they enter and see my giant axolotl I'll put on a gas mask and let it blast the unsuspecting victim with the spores and reproduce with them until they succeed in having offspring, I would also transfer the aphrodisiac hallucination effect to their sweat as opposed to spore production.

I would then have them work cash paid jobs that don't require an ID to earn some money for a couple of months and use that money to buy armour and weapons and other historical weapons as well as training in using these armaments (using the circles and biomaterial and electricity to speed up their development) I'd even get a small Viking canoe. Then, I'd suit up my regenerating, photosynthesising, immortal, extremophile warriors and send them to the country they originated from e.g. my immortal samurai would go to Japan, my immortal Viking would go to Scandinavia, etc. They don't have IDs so I'd use traditional transportation such as the Viking boat-style canoe for the Viking. (These are the only real major expenses so far so it's the only time I'd have to gather up money)

Now that my 12 immortal warriors have landed I'd have them fight against the modern people of their nation to see whether the medieval warriors would slaughter them or if the citizens would suppress them. (The purpose of the aphrodisiac hallucinogenic is to prevent easy imprisonment and it's unlikely an in humane special isolated prison would be received well considering how human they look).

*** I'm no expert in committing crimes, but the first thing that comes to mind is to do the deed using some weapon that is somewhat difficult to taste safely, and clean up in a similar way. Of course, that still requires the ability to commit any crime at all. But presuming you can do that semi-reliably, poisons to kill and acid to clean seems like a safeish bet. That all depends on what tasting the history of something actually means, and the particular circumstances of the whole thing, of course.

*** Some options:

- The weapon is a deadly poison. The 'vampire' can't taste it without risk.
- The weapon is a bullet made of ice; the death happens late at night. By the time the body is found, the weapon has evaporated; nothing to taste.
- The victim is encased in concrete and dumped into the Pacific ocean, far from shore. There's no sign of the body, and nothing to taste.

In the second case:

- Frame someone that the Detective absolutely hates. Make it look like he tried to clumsily hide the evidence and failed. Since the detective hates him, the Detective will find it easy to believe he did it, and will therefore easily convince everyone else

** You possess the ability to amalgamate (like mercury) materials. Your body is used as if it were mercury in this reaction so if you try to amalgamate too much you will destroy yourself or damage yourself beyond what natural healing can repair.

You can control the speed of the reaction and you can use parts of your body that are no longer attached to you in the reaction e.g. blood, urine, sweat, etc. Can be collected and used.

The scenarios I'd like you to munchkin are;

- how would you use this ability? In a modern day setting as well as any other setting including a fictitious one where you believe it would be of immense value/use to whatever goal you desire to achieve with it.

- how would you use this to rule the world/country in medieval times (you can choose whichever country/area you wish to conquer, especially if your country is too easy/hard to conquer).

- how would you become the worlds richest person using this ability.

- how would you survive a battle royal scenario with 99 other participants (one scenario where only you have the power, some of your opponents have the power and all of your opponents have the power. You could also reverse munchkin here to see how you'd survive as one of the normal people or the only normal person)

- how would you colonise another planet using this ability.

- How would you destroy the earth. How would you destroy the universe.

*** I think you've miscommunicated something here. Humans can already amalgamate with some chemicals, such as strong acids. This is generally avoided. Being able to do his with a wider category of chemicals seems like strictly a weakness.
