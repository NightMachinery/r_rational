Posting it here because I'm unlikely to get many unbiased replies on [[https://old.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/][the PGtE subreddit]]. Spoilers up to and including the current book.

So, in the light of the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/02/01/peregrine-iii/#comments][latest extra chapter's comment section]] being filled with people still looking for specks in Tariq's eyes for having dared to stop Black's rampage, I went looking for alternative discussion threads. Eventually I caught up to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-practical-guide-to-evil-web-serial-discussion-and-ideas-thread.521137/][the one on Spacebattles]], and while a lot of it is "that's not how I would go about being overpowered, they must all be morons" and "Callow is full of predjusticed cowards and mook-generators", but there's an interesting perception that people both here and over there seem to share.

See, people talk about Named growing in power with their story and they seem to think this works like some sort of situational boost. The hero gets a bonus to stamina and strength for having his back against the wall. The villain takes extra damage immediately after revealing the superweapon. Except I'm not sure whether the book supports that interpretation past the surface level.

The actual confrontations always seem to display the result opposite to the one advertized (especially by Black). The heroes die in droves and accomplish two and a half victories total (I count the Capitain's death as a half because Bard isn't quite a hero, has accomplished that mostly offscreen - thematically appropriate, but still - and did it mostly to brand Black into destroying everything he had been working on). The closest thing the leading heroes of the Tenth Crusade have to a plan is to antagonize even more people. Catherine never, ever, loses.

Part of it can be attributed to the fact that Amadeus is a nationalist that overlooks Praes that he has to work with for Praes that he's aiming for, and so is angry at the Empire getting the short end of the stick for over a millenium, but at least some of this is subjective. Another part is that Amadeus is right about lasting victories: heroes get all kinds of comebacks: second wind, arrival of cavalry, resurrection. Meanwhile, what happens when the villains actually lose, we've seen in the cases of Sabah and Wekesa.

They die.

That's pretty much it. If they're lucky, then everyone else dies with them; if they aren't, their deaths amount to nothing. I don't think we've actually seen a PoV from a capable character fully aware of the problems ahead that /didn't/ think themselves outmatched, be it the Bard, the Pilgrim, or the Herald of the Deeps.

I think Erraticerrata kind of wrote himself into a corner with the whole "the Empire stands triumphant" premise. He couldn't sacrifice any of the established bad guys without starting a death spiral like the one with the Capitain, which meant the readers' perception of heroes could be only based on their effectiveness against normal opponents. That the villains gradually undermine themselves and die just before their ultimate triumph still means we get multiple books of them wiping the floor with one potentially dangerous hero after another.

That said, the balance still matters - for the Named, at the very least. The Roles are situational, unlike the Names, and while this is speculation, I suspect they are just perspectives common enough to empower a Named (or create one, if there isn't one currently fitting the bill) and coherent enough to fit into a single head (barely, in Hierarch's case). The thing is, in my opinion, that stories should be seen as sequences of events rather than singular events - as inevitable outcomes rather than states of empowerment. [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/chapter-34-lesson/][As Black once said]]:

#+begin_quote
  Villains like Heiress think of power as something they can rain down on their enemies, but that's a false perception. She could set an entire field aflame and still die from an arrow in the throat.
#+end_quote

If playing to the expectations of the Role would actually empower, then Akua's boost would have allowed her to act as an actual player instead of a means for Malicia to get the superweapon made, and Sabah would turn into the Beast every time. We don't see Catherine's doing stuff like making William claim the grounds for the kingdom and getting Akua to admit being an enemy to get stronger - she did it /to get the goddamn sword/.

That said, [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/13/chapter-31-high-noon/][Cat mentioned that having a /right/ to a victory onle makes it easier, but not a given]], and we have stuff like [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/interlude-lest-dawn-fail/][Hanno's reinforcements at the last moment]]:

#+begin_quote
  The enemy appeared in a flash of blinding Light, evaporating the goblinfire-touched stone as the White Knight charged through. Behind him followed the mounted strength of Procer, pouring out like a stream of steel-clad death. He did not need to give orders in the matter of answer. Balls of flame bloomed across the ranks of the Third and hit the charging enemy, but Light burned and dispersed them like wisps of smoke. Crossbows fired in a perfect volley, and these drew some blood, but none touched the White Knight or the men behind him -- as if the hand of some god steered away harm. The horsemen charged down the slope with unnatural grace, not a one stumbling over the harsh incline or jagged stones, and so the entered the killing field. The caltrops lasted a single heartbeat before the hero raised his blade high and a searing flame swept before him, clearing a path. The sappers fired their opening salvo, sharpers and brightsticks. It was like throwing an egg at a wall. Explosions that should have shredded men and horses instead merely singed them, the light that should have seared eyes into blindness was laughed off.

  Horns sounded, deep and promising ruing. The horsemen took three volleys, before reaching Mok's pikemen. Arrows and fire, the billowing poisonous clouds of smokers and the hard bark of sharpers killing less than thirty. This, Grem thought, was the face of the enemy. Of the Heavens putting their hand to the scale, making mockery of the strivings of men. For a single moment, as the pikemen clashed against the cavalry, it seemed like the legionaries would hold. It passed, pikes glancing off armour as the entire first rank of the cohorts were brutally trampled. In that first heartbeat, Grem One-Eye lost at least two hundred men. The relentless brutality of the carnage almost awed him. Horsemen continued to pour out of the passage and slowly the Third Legion began to bend. Like a man with a knife slid into the belly, groaning in pain.
#+end_quote

But even there, Black Knight just waits until the inevitable outcome of "the cavalry has made it in time and joined the battle" has happened, and then closes the book and says "The end". Still, can someone come up with an in-text example of the contrary (a story being a situation where the hero is stronger rather a situation that happens inevitably)?

**** Liesse is probably the best instance of her "losing" that we're going to get. And even in that case, what did it actually change, as far as overarching plot goes? Not much, it seems to me. All it amounted to is Catherine angsting a bit and setting out to try and hammer out a lasting peace so Callow wouldn't get constantly trampled in future (which she would have done regardless). The consequences weren't shown to be much of a setback for her plans. We're /told/ it's a loss, and it superficially looks like one, but it has about as much impact on how events develop as someone killing her favourite puppy would have.

** Fate/Luck and Magic are the things that go super wonky around Heroes and Villains, to fit *A* story. Also, the heavens literally give extra power to heroes to push them closer to the story where they win, IF they are in a story where they win. Heaven's help with direct intervention, or slightly more subtle things like leaving artifacts around, swords landing in lucky places, gaining the exact power a hero needs to counter their villain etc.

It seems that heaven and hell can only spend their power if it pushes towards a story. William got chopped down like a punk because he wasn't in the story where he won anymore, and so it was just between him and Cat.

​

The main thing about narrative power that I think holds is that the stronger a story is, the more power and bullshit luck can be poured into heroes/villains to hold to the story. It could even be the case that any story that is ongoing *must* happen as per the story - the only way to change it is to change the story, by introducing new elements that recontextualise the existing elements. Because freewill is a thing, this happens a lot without people noticing - they just did the natural thing of training, laying a trap, that leads into another story about a villain being clever etc. But if the new story is weaker, it doesn't matter what people do that should work, if it doesn't follow how the heavens and hells think it /should/ go they will tip the scales.

​

Heroes die in droves because they are going up against the Big Bads, and become warnings to the next lot - roadbumps are mentioned, and this is what happens when too many villains or heroes bunch up. The stronger, longer term story wins out.

I would also like to point out that Akua could easily have been successful from a narrative point of view. Not for long after her rise to the tower, but still could have killed all the main characters.

​

#+begin_quote

Well, shes the main character in the book, she's not going to permanently die half way through. But she suffers consequences all the time and often does not get what she wants. She still doesn't have what she ultimately wants. And she is a near explicit exception to the rule of what happens to villains and how they act, that's kinda the point of the book.

** I'm kind of confused about what you are asking. The premise of the story is that for all of recorded history Good has been winning. But just in the leadup to the story, Evil has won a few, thanks to some rationalist meta-work by Black.

​

The big tension of the story is which of these trends is 'real', and which is just an aberration? Like, for the longest time stupid Good was beating stupid Evil. Now Smart Evil has appeared and defeated Stupid Good. How will it fare against Smart Good? That's your story. Will Smart Evil win because the secret sauce is Smart + Evil, or will Smart Good win because Smart is multiplicative of power, and they started with more power to multiply?

​

As far as Cat's experiences not bearing either trend out, that's not really a surprise, right? Like, if local effort couldn't overpower either of these trends (that is, if evil pragmatists or good idealists always won), then we wouldn't get anything out of Cat's fights. She could tell the winner/loser based entirely on the alignments ahead of time.

Yeah, but the thing is that Black's warnings were about the heroes being dangerous if you give them an opening, about stories making standard evil behaviour inevitably lethal - which we had a full book of, to no apparent effect on the protagonist. Black's methods and understanding of the narrative are explicitly noted to be a sign of professionalism rather than something unique - yet so far none of the good guys have demonstrated the same level of it.

But that's not true, is it? At no point in the story did anyone seriously consider the possibility that Heiress might get killed by a random non-protagonist. In fact, she explicitly has a pattern-of-three in the second book that makes it impossible for her to be killed by anyone but Catherine.

Actually, I can't think of any Named character getting killed by a nameless mook in the entire story except as a "His hubris was his end" thing. (eg the Shining Prince gets killed on Catherine's explicit order while trying to arrange a duel with her, not by a random arrow during the ensuing melee)

  “That's her weakness,” the heroine elaborated, ignoring him after an amused look. “Squire is a transitional Name, it can't match the kind of raw power a fully realized hero can throw around. Get her in a one-on-one fight and you should be able to kill her.”

*** Well, we know that it's /possible/ to die like that - the previous Black Knight got swarmed, and some of the crusading heroes died both at the Camps and in Vales. You're probably right in the sense that dying to a normie requires screwing up first - if the hero's advance leads into another scene, the soldiers will get the same treatment as caltrops and an inconvenient slope.

Despite that, I don't think that a Chosen's story requires another Named to run into a dead end or just lose momentum - we know that trials /technically/ aren't a guaranteed success. They are about a choice, or a test, and we've seen how cheating typically ends. Technically, if there's no narrative checkpoint ahead, a random battle shouldn't have a predetermined outcome either. Where the Named come in useful is that having another perspective adds another potential outcome - at least that's how Cat treats the tug-of-plot. The having a nemesis just means that there's a confirmed point in the future the plot is progressing towards.

As for the pattern of three fights - it had no actual significance for Catherine and so had so little impact on her (Chider's "success" literally negated all that was accomplished during the previous steps) that she /didn't notice it/.

** From the prologue we have this quote -

#+begin_quote
  Through the passing of the years grooves appeared in the workings of Fate, patterns repeated until they came into existence easier than not, and those grooves came to be called Roles. The Gods gifted these Roles with Names, and with those came power.
#+end_quote

That's the basic concept that PGtE narrative runs on. The known PGtE timeline has written history for some 500-1000 years before the events of the story. Throughout these years, there have been so many repeating patterns that /we/ identify as tropes occurring in Creation.

Secondly we have the gods as both audience and player. Kinda like a DND player. However they are obviously biased towards their own favourite side, hence Creation has meta rules in place to keep the balance between them. For every Good side intervention, the evil wizard gets a powerful boost. For every evil victory, there is some hero that comes perfectly equipped to murder them. For every long term evil victory, the Good side sort of builds up narrative "power" that can be deployed in the form of Crusades. It's all balanced.

God's almost never directly intervene, only through Angels, incarnations, or some other middleman. I suspect this is because if they got directly involved, they would be considered as "players" and hence the laws of Creation would apply to them as well.

The majority of the time, existing stories will have more chance of repetition. Genre-savvy characters like Catherine can tie events in her life to existing stories, binding people, places and herself to whatever outcome that story has.

However, there is some chance of a "new" role occurring, as with the case of Hakram. He's the first orc in centuries to get a Role (as Catherine's right hand), and as such, the gods-as-audience find him interesting and give him a power boost in the form of his Name, Adjutant.

New stories on the other hand, are much scarcer. Because Creation has quite a decent chunk of written/oral history, there is a high chance that any given story has already occurred in the past and people just don't know it.

In this context, Catherine has so, so many "firsts". From what we know, she's the first ever Squire that didn't transition into a "Knight" Name (her Role was the Evil Queen of Callow, but the Name transition was interrupted by Black). She's the first ever Fae ruler in Creation, and now she is First Under the Night. She's an outlier that doesn't take power from the existing gods, becomes a God herself, and then abandons that mantle in favour of mortality, acquiring power from a newly apotheosised pair of goddesses.

The gods-as-players, hate her because she's ruining their game, but the gods-as-audience are throwing trial after trial onto her because she's so /interesting/ and they want to see what she will do in different situations.

Her /Story/ could, maybe, perhaps, be completely unprecedented in the history of Creation, which is why we're reading it.

** My impression is that the narrative is an icy bridge, Names are the old minivans with poorly maintained safety features and worn out tires, and Roles are the grooves in the snow that guide you along the same path that the previous minivan used, whether that is to stay on the road or to slide into the river or a ditch.

That's where the metaphor ends. People get their minivans by driving in the grooves and the minivans get stronger as long as the person stays in the groove.

But that's role-playing xp not a situational bonus. And there's plenty of xp drain going on to offset it.

Black's strategy has been to forge a new path, which doesn't lead to death. It's a good long term strategy, GB immortality plus consistency makes for a slow and steady rise to power, especially if he can maintain it for a few centuries to where circumstances align in ways that make the story of his continued survival repeat more often. He kinda screwed it up when he started over with different reasons because that's a new role now, and apparently one that gets him a new (and therefore weak) name.

Cat's strategy is more powerful in the short term. If her groove starts guiding her off the road she abandons her minivan and finds another. Pattern of 3 where the squire loses? Gee good thing I'm not the squire any more. Redemption story that will end up with me dead? Well I'll just find the worst villain in reach and try to negotiate an alliance. The outcome doesn't even matter, I'm clearly not on my way to redemption if he's a potential ally. Ice queen is outmatched? Ok, you're the ice queen now. (In several months:) Priestess of the night meets her end? Nah that's actually a goddess of the night and also ice queen, I'm way over there.

  What do we, practically speaking, know about how the narrative works?
#+end_quote

We know it works however the author wants it to work. In practical terms, annals of writing have so many different tropes that you could justify practically any outcome by saying "narrative made it happen". Hero gets shot in the throat by a mook? Well, he got careless and was punished for his hubris. Hero /doesn't/ get shot in the throat even though he is fighting alone against a small army? Well, he is doing a heroic last stand, clearly he can't actually /die/ there, that'd be ridiculous. Hero gets shot in the throat, but then recovers immediately instead of dying on the spot? Well, clearly it was just a flesh wound, and everyone knows heroes only die in one on one sword duels with the villain anyways.

PGTE seems to be simultaneously trying to juggle three different concepts. First, it's trying to make "mundane" things like logistics, numbers of forces, exhaustion and such play a major role in conflicts (Black's strategy in regards to the legions is founded on this), which is a good thing IMO. Second, while doing that, it's also trying to keep various almost shonen-tropes going (like certain characters being able to throw mountains around and such), as well as its narrative magic. And third, it's trying to make it all work in the shape of a classic fantasy story about an underdog set against the world. And in my opinion, it loses track of some of the balls and drops them on its head from time to time. The biggest trouble comes from the contradiction of needing the classic tropes of winning 80% of fights to apply to catherine-the-main-character while also stating in-world that villains lose 80% of their fights due to universe fiat. Multiple commenters get so confused by this they start to insist Catherine is either outright a Hero, is transitioning into a Heroic name, or is somehow not a Hero while still getting all the properties of one.

The best resolution to this I see is to consider that Catherine's Role is Protagonist. While that's /traditionally/ a Heroic Role, it's not actually, technically, required to be.

In-world "protagonist" doesn't make any sense, since it inherently relies on what the book decides to show us, and webnovel PGTE is in no way a subset of a hypothetical universe of PGTE, meaning it can't affect it. But people will try to claim cat has that role to justify blatant plot errors, like cat not immediately dying whenever she does a plucky hero stunt despite being a villain.

The fae are all generic plot characters moving through the motions till mortals, Angel's, or even hellspawn disrupt them.

But there is the element of free will in it as well. They may mostly go for the tropes we know of, but they dont have to as they are people.

Also just as a possible example other could use to disprove this entire post, the crusade could be said to be a heroic powerup, and yet cat wipes the floor with it while black forces closed their only other way into callow and then invading procer himself. This could also be due to it not being started as a real crusade, but my point still stands.
