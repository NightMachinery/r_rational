Any recommendations for rational or near-rational anime? I tried to search through the subreddit but no consolidated post or comment thread seems to exist.

Edit: a recent comment thread was this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fjmd7a/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fkso4mk/]]

Edit 2: Thanks for the recommendations! I don't normally comment/reply to my posts so take your free upvotes!


** There's Death Note with its cat-and-mouse games, but I think that's more a study in what it looks like to pretend you're rational and succumb to hubris and egomania.

Anime that focuses around a game (as opposed to a sport) tends to be more cerebral and hinge on clever exploitation of rules and the opponent's psychology. In that category there's Akagi (game: Mahjong) and Kaiji (general gambling, using unorthodox games and rulesets). I understand that No Game No Life also fits this category of unorthodox games won by cleverness, but I haven't watched it.

*** No Game No Life is in a similar category to Kaiji, but far more shameless wish-fulfillment and blatant fanservice- of the sort that can get pretty uncomfortable if you don't have a tolerance for it.

Seconding all this thread's recommendations for Kaiji though, manga and anime. Every game gets explored from tons of angles, psychological and otherwise, and it does an excellent job of making the stakes feel real.

I'd also say Jojo's Bizarre Adventure actually has a lot more in common with this subreddit's tastes than you might think at first. It's basically the case study for battle anime that treats battles like puzzles to be solved, centered around deciphering your enemy's weird abilities, and figuring out how to leverage your own. At the very least I'd call it about as rational as Worm.

**** Don't get me wrong, I love me some Jojo, but it's definitely not thought through on the same level as Worm. Granted, they do have a lot in common, like unique powers and rules of combat, but Worm does these far better than Jojo.

The main thing is consistency. In Worm, characters almost always maintain the same abilities throughout, and if they get a new ability or figure out a new exploit (like coating bugs in chemicals), they continue using it and building on it. In Jojo, characters regularly show a cool new move and then forget about it forever, even in situations where it could save their life.

*** I'm really enjoying Kaiji's current arc. Unlike the usual gambling, it has more laid back feel to it even though the stakes are still high.

No Game No Life is similar to Jojo in their cleverness. They /are/ clever and hype, but really farfetched or not something that would work in real life. Not rational material, but enjoyable nonetheless.

***** Yes, in the manga. Manga maintains the quality of the first two parts, so I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the anime. 4th and the current part is different as in there is no real gambling, but the psychological battle is still there. 3rd part is mahjong and 5th part is a poker variant. 5th part actually seems to be regarded as the best part from those who caught up with the manga, but I really enjoy the different approaches of 4th and 6th part.

Its main selling point was always its puzzle-like approach to battles. Doing things others could not see, out-of-the-box thinking and trickery are fundamental. Though it can get too silly and outlandish at times, hence my slow-recommendation.

** It seems the battle of wits genre is the closest thing to rational anime. If you've seen all of the usual recommendations (Death Note, Code Geass, Kaiji) can I recommend Liar Game? It's a manga, and never got an anime adaptation, but if shows like Death Note and Kaiji interest you for the battles of wits, this will be right up your alley.

That said, I couldn't answer an anime recommendation post without mentioning Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The original, not the remake.

It's a pretty old series from 1988 about an ongoing galactic war between the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. The two "main" protagonists (There are dozens of named characters, and most of them are developed heavily) are Reinhard von Lohengramm, an Admiral whose sister is concubine to the Kaiser, and Yang Wen-li, a Commodore in the Alliance's fleet. The story follows the two men on opposite sides of the war as they rise through the ranks in pursuit of their goals.

As far as being rational, it's pretty solid. Everything that happens has a cause and effect relationship with the rest of the plot. Most characters have agency and use it to try to achieve their goals. Some characters early on hold the Idiot Ball, but it's acknowledged and justified, and the incompetent are weeded out of the story by the end of the first quarter (it's 110 25-minute episodes).

Its only big flaw is its length. 110 episodes might seem like a lot, but it's so tightly plotted that by the end of it you're left feeling it was too short.

**** Personally I can't recommend Die Neue These, unless you're already a fan of the series. It's not a bad series on its own, but the original has a timeless quality that no modern adaptation is going to be able to match.

Let me first say that I actually watched Die Neue These first, and switched to the original after the first season.

The remake does stay true to the /themes/ of the original, however due to its length, so much is stripped from the series to fit the runtime of modern anime that it's more of a cliff's notes summary of the plot. As I've said, the grand sweeping story of an entire galactic war, from almost every conceivable perspective, barely fits into 110 episodes as it is. The remake focuses more on the major plays by the main characters, and while that doesn't make for a bad series, it can't compare to the sheer scope and depth of the original's portrayal of such a vast conflict.

I also feel that much of the timeless feel of the original is lost in the remake. There's a reason that people can still get into a 32-year old series even today, because of the meticulously hand-drawn art and the soundtrack which is almost exclusively classical music. It makes the setting seem almost historical, despite being set over a thousand years in the future. It may seem daunting, but within a few episodes, once you're immersed in it, it's truly unmatched anywhere. The remake has a much more standard sci-fi look and feel to it that makes it much safer to release today, but with its generic feel and overuse (in my opinion, of course) of CGI, in 5 years or so people will be once again pointed back to the original when they ask how to get into the series.

By all means watch whichever version you want, but even as someone who watched Die Neue These first, I really can't recommend it compared to the original.

I don't see this recommendation in this subreddit often, but HunterxHunter's current arc is great. It's a political thriller with various plans and strategies going around from various sides and they are all competent. For example, a person that was first seen as grappling with a lion is actually a brilliant commander and has a strategic mind. It also helps that this arc focuses on the MC that constantly thinks.

** It dismays me that no good examples come to mind for me. Reading through the comments, only two series immediately come to mind as worthy of (further) mention, though in both cases they're 'bonus points for...' around a few scenes rather than having opposing sides be satisfying.

Fate/Zero: Though sorely little of note, the clash between Kiritsugu and Lord El-Melloi in episode 6 has a fond place in my heart. Perhaps further of note in regards to Kiritsugu's approach to the world (episodes 18 and 19 Kiritsugu's coming-of-age, episode 24 Kiritsugu and the Holy Grail's intended implementation of his wish following his thought process).

Madoka Magica [edit: I missed at first this had been already been mentioned in one of the comment threads, thus spoilering and moving to second]:

Kyubey's world outlook is delightful for me to witness, particularly when the eggs of people's assumptions/expectations-treated-as-obligatory/irrationality/incompetence smash against it.

Ehhh... I don't think that's really true. In the light novel and manga it's clear that the protagonist thinks of the people in that world the same way your average gamer thinks of NPCs, which makes sense because he's been playing in the VR version of that world for a very long time when all the inhabitants truly were mindless NPCs. It's not too surprising that he retained some peculiar mental habits as a result.

When a gamer kills a battlefield full of NPCs, the act doesn't even register for him/her as morally abhorrent because the NPCs are nowhere close to being actually alive in the first place. In fact, a gamer would probably feel less conflicted killing a horde of NPCs than they would killing an insect in the real world. So extrapolating that to the behavior of the protagonist, I think it would be more accurate to say that he is amoral rather than evil.

Basically all of his successes are achieved due to overwhelming power and ass-pulled abilities rather than him actually thinking rationally.

As for other characters, they can be generally divided into three categories:

a) worshippers of Ainz that always interpret his actions in the most favourable way,

b) caricatures of villains that stand in his way and invariably look down on him

c) and relatively normal bystanders, who in most cases either die early or just passively observe.

Only the last ones exhibit any sort of somewhat realistic responses, but they have little to no impact on the plot.

*** Adding on to this Liar Game and Alice in Borderland. I think most know Liar Game so I'll elaborate on the other. Alice in Borderland is a death game isekai. I think [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would really enjoy some of the games (mostly the diamond ones). However, it starts out significantly edgy and if that's holding you back I would say stick until MC's friends die.

** I will once again recomend the manga Ajin. There's an anime, but I haven't finished, and I know the two deviate from each other, so I will only recomend manga, but if any one can vouch for the anime, feel free.

I feel like Ajin is among one of the most rational manga out there. It's not perfect and it has that Rationality = Spock thing going on but it's downplayed and you might not even notice if one character didn't explicitly stated it.

The whole concept is: A very small number of people called Ajins (Demi-humans) can't die of anything but old age. If they die, they reset, all injuries vanish, limbs re-attach and if they are too far away, grow back. Dying is also the only way to find out one is an Ajin. As there are very few of them, governments around the world want to seize them for experiments and also to use them as test subjects to drugs, automobiles, etc. The Stories follow Kei Nagai, a student, who is found to be an Ajin after an accident. He's shown to be a /very/ rational character, as is the villain. Characters make mistakes, but the story is pretty much devoid of stupid decisions I really think people should give it a go.

** I recently read a manga called 'Battle 5 seconds after meeting' which was alright:

[[https://helveticascans.com/r/series/battle-after-meeting/]]

The setup is relatively generic shonen: A bunch of people are kidnapped, they're forced to fight in a tournament (at first), each is given 1 special power, for example 'turn your arm into a cannon equivalent to an anti-materiel rifle'. There's various different ones with greater or lesser combat utility. (Listing specific powers with all limitations and capabilities would be a spoiler, but they run the gamut from teleportation to super-strength, some mental ones, some meta-powers, etc.) Characters tend to use their powers quite rationally, I find.

The protagonist gets, verbatim, 'your power is whatever the other person person thinks your power is'. The story is about him trying to figure out exactly what that means/how it works, and then mindgame everyone around him. Pretty fun.

** Expanding on the list I posted on the linked comment thread:

Transhuman and sci fi detective stories:

- Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Old classic sci fi anime everyone loves. Cyborgs. A handful of really nice episodic mysteries centering around some transhuman concept or another. Eventually settles into a longer mystery that I didn't find as engaging. The rest of the franchise is good too, though I think GITS:SAC is the best.

- Psycho-Pass: Very similar to GITS, usually considered an "almost as good" substitute. About utility functions I guess? I think Psycho-Pass's one-off mystery episodes are weaker, but its multi-episode plotlines are stronger than in GITS. Also everyone says the second season is terrible but it's like 80% as good as the first.

People having quiet adventures:

- Spice & Wolf: Economics and romance in a fantasy world. All the drama is in few-episode-long economics/markets plots, while the romance story takes the entire season to slowly go places. The fact that it's a fantasy world doesn't matter. The microeconomics occasionally went faster than I could keep track of, but I got the impression it was all correct.

- Kino's Journey: Kino goes from town to town and sees how people live their lives. The towns are all philosophical or science fiction thought experiments, with completely different tech levels and ways of life in each. Don't think too hard about how they're all sitting in the same world; they're all well-realized and thought provoking separately. Kino doesn't give an opinion on the places, so you're stuck with your own thoughts on these things.

- Mushishi: Similar to Kino's Journey, a traveling medicine man helps people with problems with spirits. Spirits are like... magical intangible versions of tiny animals? More hydras and corals than dogs and cats, I mean. They get places they shouldn't be and our protagonist helps people out with them. Not really rational, but it does have a protagonist that solves weird problems with knowledge. I liked the dub.

Something else:

- Shinsekai Yori: Life in a remote village of psychics. Really cohesive, careful worldbuilding, even when (especially when) it seems like people are acting weird or the authors forgot something. Hard to say much about it without spoiling it though, it completely thrashes the status quo every few episodes. Also really dark, watch out for that.

- The Devil Is A Part Timer: The dark lord of a fantasy universe gets sucked into a magical portal, stuck in Tokyo, and gets a part time job at a McDonalds. The premise gets stranger, but everyone handles it like sensible adults. Makes people handling things well funny.

- Madoka: Deconstruction and reconstruction of magical girl anime. It's good if you like those or deconstruction/reconstructions.

Not rational, still recommending:

- The Eccentric Family: A thoughtful, nuanced look at what it's like to be a magical talking raccoon in modern day Japan.

- Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?: Not rational, but it might make you want to work out, which means watching it is rational.

*** No Game No Life has a great premise for a rationalist story (though possibly a bit anvilicious) but it messes it up by having the main characters be terribly irrational. Winning that consistently shouldn't be possible, especially since many of those games depend on an element of chance.

While I do recommend Dr. Stone, I feel like it falls someone short of rational when it's revealed just how long the people in the nearby village have been around. They should have had plenty of time to repopulate the earth and rebuild civilization. Especially given that there's the ruins of the old civilization and they're descended from astronauts, who would have done what they could to get them started. What's especially bad is that one of the astronauts is Senku's dad, and he put a lot of effort into sending messages to Senku on the assumption that he'd somehow turn back from being stone. He was right, but there's no way he could have guessed that.

*** The science in dr stone is /mostly/ accurate, it's about the level where they've heard about these things in high school/university, but don't really understand how they work.

For example, in the first few episodes he mixes nitric acid with ethanol to produce nital because it's an industrial solvent. But in industry, they add ethanol because nitric acid is /too strong/ for their purposes, and they need to dilute it. There's no reason why senku would want to /dilute/ his acid.

***** it wasn't anything major, but for me, the katanas were just the straw which broke the camel's back. Katanas are incredibly intensive to create (as are many swords), and take a significant amount of practice to learn to use. Spears are cheaper to make, easier to use effectively, and it's easier for multiple spear wielders to fight together. And they already have spears! Katanas were hands down a massive waste of time for them.

The fight in which they were used showed an even bigger problem - they weren't willing to use their weapons to kill their enemies. The natural consequence of this is should be that they get steamrolled, regardless of their technology level. Past this point, I know the only reason they're alive is because of plot armour, and I lost my investment in the conflict.

On that note, Centaur's Life is another surprising one for worldbuilding - the overall impression is that although the author is paid to draw soft porn, what they /really/ want to be writing about is the evolutionary biology of fantasy monsters.
