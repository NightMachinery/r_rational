Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So recently my counselor recommended I get tested for ADHD. Now up until that point my understanding of ADHD was pretty limited and I only knew the "common knowledge" of it. Upon doing more research on ADHD I was surprised because it was a lot different then I imagined it to be. I had this idea that it mostly just made it harder to pay attention, and made you really hyper. But really these are just some of the most visible symptoms of a larger problem, that being the part of your brain that self regulates develops slower than normal, which impairs various executive functions.

Executive functions affected by ADHD include: 1. Self-awareness 2. Inhibition 3. Non-Verbal Working Memory 4. Verbal Working Memory 5. Emotional Self-Regulation 6. Self-motivation 7. Planning and Problem Solving

This hurts your ability to focus on long term goals, and means people with ADHD have a hard time focusing on things that don't have immediate consequences. I started to see patterns of this in my own life and how I often put things off to the last minute and only worked my best when I was regularly held accountable. I regularly started and switched projects, I have more than one story I started writing for fun that never went anywhere. So I am curious if medication and potentially different strategies would make me a lot more productive. I was already going through life developing strategies for coping with my own attention/motivation issues, but if it is ADHD then having a better understanding could potentially make it easier to develop these strategies in the future.

I highly recommend any person who is currently in college if they are having issues to take advantage of free counseling services if your college provides it. You are already paying for it in your tuition so you might as well take advantage. If I do have ADHD I probably would have never found out if I didn't go.

*** Yes. Absolutely yes. The only downside is some medications might not work as well as others for you. I went to a psychiatrist and they had me take a gene survey (swab my cheek, send it in). Results came in and the medicine I was put on worked far better than anything Ive ever been on. It even helped alleviate my clinical depression.

Going from no medication to medication was like waking up to magical powers.

** So. Easter has come and gone at this point.

I remember saying back around Christmas or New Years that the Mary Poppins story I'm working on might be finished by Easter. I don't think I've given any sort of update on it in a long while, so this is just me confirming that it isn't abandoned.

I've recently been, um, "working with a new writing partner." Her name is Glory. You know, Glory? Lucy's little sister?

/Alright fine, I bought half a pound of Morning Glory seeds off Amazon./

*[EDIT: DISCLAIMER:* I'm going to turn 30 in about a month, and I've been experimenting with my own neurochemistry since I was 18. Drugs are not toys. If you don't have the maturity to treat them with respect then they will fudge your entire world. Do *not* run out and buy Morning Glory seeds based on this reddit comment.]

It's pretty much impossible to get anything meaningful accomplished while under the influence of LSA, and the nausea during the come-up is a bit uncomfortable, and the /other stuff/ the next day isn't ideal, but I feel like it's /useful/.

The last time I did it (Tuesday) I ended up having a weird "ego-death" type experience where I felt myself as a part of the "snake god" who Is the version of our reality that I was occupying at the time of the experience, and "I" felt the twisting of the shape of space / "I" /was/ the twisting of the shape of space, the line between "me" and "the snake" was nonexistent. I could see it (the shape of space) in my mind's eye (which I don't normally have easy access to), it was like made out of a curved infinity symbol, except instead of connecting in the middle it continued on to another infinity symbol layered on top of it... idk, the end result was like a writhing sphere. It felt profound at the time.

When I woke up the next day, I spent several hours reading through Wikipedia about the history of sanitation and waste management and plumbing, as you do. Here's a few articles that stood out in my mind:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-to-back_house]]

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet#History]]

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_toilet]]
#+end_quote

It's hard to believe how unsanitary life was for the vast majority of all the humans who ever lived, all the way up to the last couple hundred years. No wonder most people used to die in their thirties.

Anyways, you can't do Morning Glories too often because you'll build up a tolerance and no longer experience the same effects, and it's relatively hard on your digestive tract (plants evolved these chemicals /specifically/ to discourage us animals from eating them), so I've only done it four times since mid-March, but I've definitely found the days following a trip to be especially good for writing. I feel like she's infusing the work with a particular flavor that just suits the content perfectly.

I actually had the thought to make /this comment which you are currently reading/ during the trip itself. I opened up my word processor and tried to write some things... It started out similarly to this comment, talking about the missed Easter deadline and such, then I started typing the stuff about Lucy's little sister Glory and became confused. Here's a quote from that document:

#+begin_quote
  Oh good. The white square with black squiggles on it now has, you won't understand even if I word it accurately so let's say, swirling rainbows all over it. Like it wasn't hard enough to type already.
#+end_quote

Shortly thereafter, I laid down in bed and put on my headphones, and about an hour later (maybe?) is when all the weirdness with the snake god and the strange geometry happened.

Here's a few of the songs I was listening to while all that was happening:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM_xL9qJUOQ][Au5 - Atlantis]]

  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2zySjlVeXI][Infected Mushroom - Trance Party]]

  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVQIlMM1s30][Vök - Waterfall (Neelix Remix)]]
#+end_quote

All three of them are incredible, but if you're going to just sample one of them to sate your curiosity then choose the third one. I feel like that one in particular was the cause of a lot of the weird spiraling thought loops I experienced during the timeless ego-death being centered around, well, /death/, and it might've pushed me into a bad trip if it weren't so pretty. A bad trip could've been especially disturbing since I could feel my body... I don't really know how to describe that feeling; maybe, normally you feel like you're the mind occupying a body, and this sensation feels like you /are/ the body... idk.

I haven't spoken to the last person who I considered a friend in about two-and-a-half years, so no trip sitter. But once I hit a certain threshold, I just get in bed and disengage, I don't try to do things. I don't think of psychedelics as being recreational, my use of them is strictly shamanistic.

** Earlier this week FB reminded me of [[https://i.imgur.com/4KPIxKw.jpg][a poster]] I made for a homework assignment in an ecology class in college half a decade ago. My partner and I were busy that semester and dallied in making it until the night before it was due, when we worked on it and a few other projects until the wee hours of the morning, set it to print @ 4' x 6', and went out for pancakes -- which in turn made us late to the faux-conference we were meant to present this at. But the "poster session" went smoothly, our spiel accompanied by the GoT opening theme playing softly in the background.

Anyway, since this is the last season of the show (and it's unclear if the direwolves will return, perhaps due to nutritional stress ;]), I thought I might share. Sorry about the poor quality, the original file is who knows where, so this is the facebook version.

** Some people tried to rob me, and I was pretty sure I knew who it was. I looked at the list of people who would have had the knowledge to try, and it was pretty small. I told the guy's girlfriend and gave her a copy of the security footage, and she confronted him about it. About a week later someone tried to break into my apartment again, this time they're not covering their face at all and they're using a different vehicle. That time I got a pretty good look at one of their faces, and while he had the correct build as the guy I thought it was, it clearly wasn't him. I'm not convinced it was the same person both times.

I'm having some trouble with a few points.

- How much probability mass should I assign to unknown unknowns? Just some guy overheard in a bar that I might have something worth stealing? Things like that.

- How do I reason about things when enemy action might be trying to hide the truth? I'm not convinced the guy who covered his face and the other guy are the same person.

Regardless there's enough suspicion that I don't want any of them involved in my life, but it's presented some more concrete epistemological problems.

*** Some stuff comes immediately to mind:

- Most important! Change the screws on your lock. The screws that you can see in your lockset door strike plate are often just half an inch long and can be broken off by one kick to the door in the right spot. Replacing the screws with ones that are 3 to 4 inches long make it much harder to break in. This [[https://www.familyhandyman.com/home-security/how-to-reinforce-doors-entry-door-and-lock-reinforcements/][article]] goes much more indepth, but if you don't want to or can't do everything on it, step 4 on drilling in deeper holes and changing the screws is very simple to do.
- How well known is all of this to neighbors? Maybe one heard about important things about you have and spotted an opportunity?
- Maybe you should talk to your neighbors just to see if they saw or know anything useful?
- How well are things going with the guy and his girlfriend? If their relationship has deteriorated, then that's a sign that he might have decided to get some revenge. If they had made up before the second attempt, then I would say that he'd be less likely to try anything out of a desire for revenge. Not to say that he couldn't have done it anyway in both cases, but if they made up, the odds should drop since he has more to lose.
- Do you know this guy well enough to say that he has a vindictive personality, sociopathic, or narcissistic one? Does he have a history of anything? If he does, then it's a warning sign for you and the girlfriend.
- Ask about attempted or successful thefts in your area. If the stranger has tried to steal from you both times instead of being someone else to make the guy you know look innocent, then the stranger will have attempted to steal from other people and not just you. If he was just to help the other guy escape from suspicion, then no reported crimes should be suspicious. To find this out, you could ask the police about crimes in the area. This is where Bayes Rule would be helpful on how much the probabilities should shift, but I don't know how to apply it to this situation.

Well, his name came up a lot in the anonymous-led witch hunt for a high profile rape case, and there's some information I have that they didn't that makes me suspicious. He was pretty pissed at me when I told his girlfriend about that. Other then that I don't see any big warning signs aside from the standard young-drunk-instagram fuckboy thing he's got going on, which implies a certain level of narcissism. Doesn't have any pictures that don't include himself or expensive cars/watches. I personally think he's an asshole. Aside from the high-profile rape case I'm not seeing any particular history.

There was one in a building near mine, I managed to get in touch with the guy. I'm of the opinion that they probably weren't related, the MO is pretty different. We don't have anything in common, no common contacts, but we were both specifically targeted.

I have no idea how he and his girlfriend are getting along, but there's a possibility that she's helping him by fabricating an alibi and you just said how you didn't want to talk to her as well. So there's a chance that you are also on poor terms with her if she's upset with you about accusing her boyfriend of being involved in rape when it wasn't proven. Or he's convincing her that you are scum considering how much he must dislike you.

Just pointing out it might be two enemies, not just the one.

Anyway it sounds like you are keeping alert and cautious. Good luck!

#+end_quote

I put myself in their shoes. I have to ask: is "Convincing a guy who looks like me to attempt to steal from the same place" really a good way to remove suspicion? I'd be worried about the second guy being caught and blabbing that I had informed him--or being mistaken for me!

Also, if the goal is to make you think random burglars are likely to attempt your house, a person who looks completely different is a better choice.

How many times has someone tried to break in, since you've gotten the camera? Maybe the background rate is about this high, but if isn't, then the timing is suspicious.

What information are you supposing they have to convince them to break in? Is whatever you have really that valuable or likely known by random strangers?

The fact that they are on camera should be a deterrent. Do you think the potential thieves know that and are attempting anyway?

Probably, the guy came up to my door at 11:45pm on a sunday with his face plainly visible and knocked loudly. I don't know if he was planning on forcing me to open my safe at gunpoint or just trying to be seen. I said "I don't know this person, give me a second". Sometime between me saying that and me putting on pants he ran off, and I chased him down to his car. Why do you think the thieves would loudly knock in the middle of the night, and then run off when I don't answer the door quickly enough? They also jammed a fire escape so they could open it from the outside, something I discovered pretty quickly.

The guy I thought it was had a very solid alibi for that time, he was with his girlfriend, but the other guy was the same in both incidents.

The other guy was on the lobby camera for more than a half hour waiting for someone to let him in, which is also very strange considering their previous MO.

#+begin_quote

It's a secure building, not my camera but on belonging to the apartment. They used a lock pick gun the first time. Only the two times, they seemed pretty scared the second time.

#+end_quote

Well I wouldn't want to get into that on the internet. I haven't kept any valuables in the apartment in months, but I can definitely see why I'd have been a tempting target. Also I let his girlfriend know he was involved (to what extent I don't know) in a high profile rape case/internet-witch-hunt. He was pretty pissed off about that, but eventually calmed down.

It could be that he and his friends are trying to terrorize you as opposed to stealing anything. I really don't know. I'm glad you've talked to the authorities--they are in a better position to help with the incident itself. In fact, perhaps we should return to the original questions.

#+end_quote

Humans have a tendency to see intent where there is none, and to underestimate the number of explanations they haven't considered. A recent example at work: a typically-angry, vocally dissatisfied coworker from a different division stopped joining my group for lunch. We were unable to get a hold of him for a few days. Our coworkers thought he might have quit suddenly, or that one of us had somehow offended him.

Turns out he broke his ankle and naturally took a few days off.

The point is, it had nothing to do with us, or with his work--and if someone behaves strangely, it usually has nothing to do with most of the people who know them.

But! In this case it sounds like there is a lot of information that we are missing. "Some random person on the internet says it's probably nothing" isn't safe reasoning. "I probably overestimate the level of intent behind events, and how relevant they are to me" is more reasonable, but still: you definitely know better than we do.

I wish I could help more.

****** Yeah, I hear you. That's part of why I tried to keep the question to the bit where my epistemology struggles, it's a big complicated thing with a lot of small details that are important, and also sensitive and not really something I think would be appropriate to share on an account that's connected to my name, especially if the guy does happen to be innocent.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They taped the fire escape. There was a heavier set guy, who looks like the best friend of who I think it was, who was at both incidents. I only caught him on film the first time, the second time he had his accomplice go in so he could bypass all the cameras via the fire escape.

#+begin_quote

I am a little bit worried that I'm creating a just-so story, but the more I think about it the more certain I become. A lot of small details that only make sense if the person is in a particular mind set. The big thing is the difference in MO between the first and the last attempt. The heavy guy was there for both, but I wasn't supposed to know that, I just chased them down. I think that only makes sense if he knew that I'd caught them on camera.

*** Ok, so you have your prior for:

1. Guy tries to cover up robbery by getting someone else to show their face: pretty low

2. Guy (or same group) tries to rob same place again: low-ish

3. Someone unrelated tries to rob the same place again: very low in that time frame

Then you get evidence - 'guy shows up trying to rob my place again' This increases the posterior for all 1. 2. and 3. but since 2. and 3 are significantly more likely a priori (for me) it will still be the leading hypothesis (with 1. having way higher chance to be true than before of course but still lower than 2.)

Throwing out some numbers based on my vague feelings for the priors - I'd put something around 20% on it being a cover-up by the same guy and at least 75% on it being the same guy/group as before.

Don't pay attention to the numbers but this would be the way I'd start thinking about it.

** So for the last several months, I've been woken up by my neighbor's opening their door in the morning between 4-6AM / turning on their truck due to their driveway being maybe 10 feet from my bedroom window (duplex). I've spoken to them about it, used white noise machines and a fan, and occasionally used earplugs (which are decent but don't seem to be good to use on a regular basis), but the issue hasn't gotten any better. I think the wall insulation is just very poor and I can't turn up the white noise to block the sound sufficiently without my ears hurting when I wake up.

I feel like I'm missing something obvious and slight sleep deprivation is driving me crazy; any advice appreciated. Anyone had to deal with something similar?

*** Well, the most obvious and effective approach I can think of would be to sleep in a different room, though I have no idea how feasible that is in your case.

​

Alternatively you could just go to bed earlier, so that you're already awake or don't lose as much sleep when your neighbor wakes you up.

​

The next most obvious would be to move your bed so that your head is at the point furthest away from the window when you're lying in it.

​

Next step would be to block off the window with something that absorbs or at least muffles sound, be it blankets, pillows or foam. In my (limited) experience it's the windows that are the weak-points when it comes to noise. Try it for a night or two to see whether it helps, and if it does you can rig something up so that you can still use the window during the day.

​

If that still doesn't help you could get some hearing protection ear-muffs. The cheapest ones cost less than 20 bucks on Amazon, so you're not out all that much to find out whether you can sleep with them on.

​

That's about it for obvious ideas on my part, not counting spending loads of money to sound-proof your flat.

*** I had a somewhat similar problem for about half a year, renting an apartment which turned out to be near a temporary construction site.

My local-optima solution was to put on earplugs immediately when the workers woke me up (~5 AM). I think this is relevant to your case because after some time (several months), getting back to sleep became almost immediate (or at least felt that way), whereas initially I might suffer trying to get back to sleep for ~45 mins.

I also tried the nuclear approach of sleeping the entire night every night with earplugs, which is not great, but if needs be, maybe try Mack's Slim Fit Earplugs.

Sadly or happily depending on your interpretation, I've gotten to this point as well. But from what I've read, even microsleep interruptions are considered bad, and just waking up for that short period of time still has a noticeable effect on me from what I can tell. Ideally I'd like to prevent the interruption in the first place.

If Abpraestigio's suggestion of blocking the window doesn't work, I may try those slim fit earplugs though, might be better than what I use now. Thanks!

I regularly take Vitamin d, B12 and creatine and feel like they positively affect my energy levels and mood. I eat a plant based diet so the B12 and creatine probably have a more pronounced effect on me than someone who eats meat and dairy.

I sometimes have l-theanine with coffee which for me very noticeably reduces the feelings of overstimulation or jitteriness I sometimes feel (I don't drink coffee everyday so my tolerance to caffeine isn't too high).

I've used melatonin at a dose of 0.3mg, it felt like it helped me sleep better, more regularly and feel more rested in the morning.

I've microdosed. I like how I feel when I do but I don't feel like it makes me more productive. I tend to take somewhere between 5-20 micrograms depending on the effect I'm going for and energy levels.

I've tried modafinil during the day, felt like it did make me more productive and focused. Like coffee but more. I rarely take it though. When I do, around 37-75mg of armodafinil (which is around 1/4-1/2 of the tablet).

I sometimes take zinc, and use magnesium oil. Can't say I've noticed an effect but I just take them because I might not be getting enough from diet.

I regret the phenylethylamine and the phenibut. The adrafinil was a long time ago, like 2013, but I remember not liking the way it made me feel and throwing it away.

I /feel like/ the noopept was useful (in the context of creative writing) but that could just be placebo.

Phenylpiracetam is /legit/. It's the only nootropic banned for use by athletes, because it's proven to /actually do something/ (and it doesn't eff you up like PEA or phenibut). Like, I take it only on days I work out. The effect is most noticeable with pull-ups. I started a few months ago at one set of three reps and two sets of two reps. I've progressed that up to four sets of five reps, contingent on phenylpiracetam being in my system. When it's not, I can only do five reps on the first set, and the following three sets I can only manage four reps per set.

** THIS IS A COMMENT ABOUT THE NEW AVENGERS MOVIE. DO NOT CLICK UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR DO NOT MIND BEING SPOILED.

Although I realize that blockbuster movies are not really known for continuity, in general Marvel movies have been pretty good about keeping their stories free of glaring plot holes. Which made it extremely disappointing to see the film that ended an era filled with such a large one. There may be more, but the one that is preventing me from properly enjoying the movie is the fact that despite them saying/following through with "Do not mess with the past timeline, it will screw up the future" to the point of giving back the infinity stones, they still majorly messed with the timeline. Gamora is no longer in the past, which means that she can't possibly be there for Guardians of the Galaxy and after. Same with the fact that Thanos and his army had been "snapped", meaning there can't be an Infinity War. Nebula had been killed, which means she should no longer exist. Unless somebody else can explain, please do

***** I don't think all the alternate realities could have merged together, since Alternate!Thanos came to the main reality and died there. Perhaps alternate realities are only created when a contradiction cannot be avoided or smoothed over by quantum effects. In that case, acts that don't cause contradictions just merge together into one self-consistent timeline. So the New York timeline got split off because Loki disappeared, and another timeline got created because Thanos and Gamora disappeared from it, but the 1950s timeline could have stayed consistent with the main timeline after Captain America returned the stone there; then he just stayed and kept a low profile until the right time.

It's an awesome hike with incredible views, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart. You are essentially doing a lot of climbing up hence it's a very exhausting hike. I mean you don't need to know how to rock climb or anything, but there's a lot of bluffs. So only do this if you are decently athletic and like scrabbling up over rocks.

It's about an hour and half to drive from Manhattan to the hike.

******* I will not try to explain my politics in detail, however, I will outline them.

I am a social liberal and a fiscal conservative. The closest 'mainstream' political description that approaches my beliefs is Libertarian, and even that is not quite right, because Libertarians are frequently anarchists and isolationists hiding behind a façade of Capitalism.

I believe that, one day, we might eventually have appropriate technologies to allow us to create a post-need society. However, until we have non-AI machines capable of providing Maslow's basic physiological needs (Food, water, warmth, and rest) we cannot even *begin* to start down that path.

As for why I am active on T_D, it is simple. I am horrified by the direction and modus operandi of modern 'liberal' leftism. While I frequently find myself wanting to wash my hands after dealing with some of the more distasteful T_D characters, I believe in the freedoms outlined in the US Constitution and it's amendments.

*As a general rule...*

Any group who attempts to use censorship, threats of violence, or political correctness to control political narratives is my political enemy.

Anyone who attempts to establish large-scale Socialism before we can provide basic needs for all, utilizing non-sapient labor, is my political enemy, because it simply will not work until no sapient has to do the dirty work unless they /want/ to.

Anyone who attempts to establish a Globalist world without borders is my political enemy. The larger a political entity is, the more difficult it is to change, and the harder it is to root out corruption. Power does corrupt.

*TLDR*

I want many of the same things that many on the left want. I just want to approach the goals rationally, and the modern far left is VERY far from rational.

******** I can understand everything except for the association with T_D. Distancing yourself from the left---sure, but the right is even worse. The left is corrupt a lot of the time, and the figures on the right even more so. I won't patronize you by bringing up the graphs, as I'm sure you've seen them. It seems to me that the left is well-meaning but there are many deluded actors there, while people on the right actively work against their own interests. Then there's the "blend in as super-extreme liberals to make them seem like censor-happy idiots" strategy that's being spread about everywhere, and it looks dishonest as well. I think a more rational decision would be distanced from both sides of modern politics.

********* The moderate conservative right is no worse than the moderate liberal left. In a very broad and sweeping statement with many exceptions, you can generalize the two by saying that the right generally resists change. The left generally seeks change.

Right now, many of the larger changes that the left are seeking are, IMHO, irrational and, frankly, unsafe.

In the past, I have aligned strongly with the left because I agreed with what they wanted to change. Now I have to stand with the right because the changes that the left wants are not rational at this time.

Imagine this scenario:

Two people are walking along a twenty-foot sheer cliff next to the shore of a lake. They are both very thirsty, and have no water.

The conservative wants to stay on the cliff until they can find a safe path down. The liberal wants to jump off the cliff.

The conservative makes the argument that they need to look for a safer place to get down the cliff - they can jump later, if there is no other way.

The liberal makes the argument that if they wait, they may be weak and disoriented by dehydration, and less likely to survive the fall - jumping later means a greater chance of injury.

They are both right, but it's not black and white. Currently, I stand beside the conservative, moderate right, because I think we should spend a bit more time looking for a safer way before jumping off any cliffs.

********** What is this story analogous to in this case? Climate change? If so I have to say that it's flawed. Doing nothing isn't looking for a safer way to get down the cliff. It would look like we're already falling, and the liberals are saying we need to cling to the side even if we hurt our hands because otherwise the fall will kill us, while the conservatives are saying that we're falling and we haven't died yet, so hitting the bottom can't possibly be that bad.

**** Scott has biases, and sometimes they lead to excessive leftist bashing (particularly in his older posts), but I think you're making a pretty classic mistake if you find that post to be full of bias: he's speaking descriptively, not prescriptively. Being able to accurately model how conservatives and reactionaries think doesn't make someone share their beliefs and biases, and he's actually very liberal if you read more of his posts.

Any recommendations? Is there any reason I shouldn't?

*** AO3 is better, but fanfiction.net has a larger audience, has been my experience. If you want it up for accessibility reasons, AO3 is the way to go. If you want as many people as possible to see/read your stuff, put it on both. If you make a website for yourself, it will be much more work for not much more reward than just putting it on AO3, and you won't have much traffic most likely.
