Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Power: you can mentally select one item you touch and make it Unchangeable. No impact, no chemical can deform or corrode it to any measurable degree while the effect is in power. The effect can be called off, and is broken as soon as the contact with the item stops. The item cannot exceed you in weight, volume or biggest linear value. You can effect two or more items touching each other as a single one, e.g. chain, stack of books.

*** A few ways to use this come to mind:

- *Stasis rescue:* Touch a person of your weight or less and temporarily halt everything. If they were dying from a severe traumatic injury but could be saved if only they were in an operating room which is prepped and ready to treat them, you can buy the time needed to make that happen.

- *Hostile teleport:* From other people's perspective, this can appear to be the same as being able to either teleport them to a second location with a touch, or to teleport your allies in.

- *Invincibility:* Make your skin, hair, clothing, and corneas unchangeable just prior to some kind of injury, e.g. car accident, gunshot, explosion, plane crash, stabbing, etc. Nothing can kill you if you see it coming, and you could also maintain significant 'armored' portions of your body/clothes passively even when walking around not expecting a fight.

- *Nano-blade:* Attach the thinnest strand of wire or thread you can buy to a metal handle. You might find this at a magic supply shop, used as thread so thin that it wouldn't be seen under ordinary circumstances. Tape one end of this to your wall, tape another end to a comfortable handle-shaped wooden or metal rod, make it taut, and then make it all unchangeable. You now have a nearly invisible and nearly weightless ~6 ft. long blade with a point so narrow and an edge so sharp that you could press it into a plate of metal and then slice through it if necessary.

- *Featherweight gun*: You could replace the barrel(s) and some other heavy components of a gun with thin-walled plastic. The receiver can't be modified in this manner, but just about everything else can be.

- *Hand's free dead man's switch:* When in close quarters with someone who has other powers which might allow them to kill you, you could arm three grenades, cooking each one off until only 1 second remains, then place each at different points of your body and freeze them. If the other person manages to kill you, they won't be able to stop all three grenades from going off, and as long as they're close by, you'll at least have your revenge.

*** Does it stop any internal changes in the object? Like chemical reactions or brownian motion?

What happens if you use it on liquids? Does it stop it being a liquid?

What if you try to use it on a living organism? Will the organism survive?

Lots of cool possibilities.

**** Yes to all questions - by its starting idea, Item exits the Effect exactly 100% same as it entered it, without even a single piece out of place.

***** Just some thoughts in random order:

Take a thin thread, apply the superpower. Now you've got a very sharp cutting edge, which can be used as a tool or a weapon.

Put on some rubber gloves, now you can protect your hands from stuff like molten steel.

Apply the superpower to some water as you step on it. You can walk on water!

The ability to stop biological processes could be invaluable in medicine. You can perfectly preserve organs during medical procedures. For example, only the brain really needs constant supply of oxygen, other organs can survive without it for a long time. You can start applying the superpower to patient's head, the doctors can do a long operation on something below the neck without worrying about oxygen deprivation. What is even cooler, the patient is not going to feel any pain, so you can skip anesthesia.

Since the Item cannot change, it cannot absorp any kind of radiation. So applying the superpower would turn the Item into a perfect mirror.

An indestructible container would be useful for holding hot plasma. This would actually solve fusion power.

** I stumbled upon the history of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioacetone][Thioacetone]] on youtube a few days ago. It's a real world, relatively easy to make chemical that smells so bad a 'small amount' (Not defined) produced in a lab is enough to make people vomit and/or pass out hundreds of yards away in other buildings. When it was first discovered in the late 1800s a whole town was evacuated. The smell was described as 'fearful'.

Here is an account from Oxford in 1967:

#+begin_quote
  Recently we found ourselves with an odour problem beyond our worst expectations. During early experiments, a stopper jumped from a bottle of residues, and, although replaced at once, resulted in an immediate complaint of nausea and sickness from colleagues working in a building two hundred yards [180 m] away. Two of our chemists who had done no more than investigate the cracking of minute amounts of trithioacetone found themselves the object of hostile stares in a restaurant and suffered the humiliation of having a waitress spray the area around them with a deodorant. The odours defied the expected effects of dilution since workers in the laboratory did not find the odours intolerable ... and genuinely denied responsibility since they were working in closed systems. To convince them otherwise, they were dispersed with other observers around the laboratory, at distances up to a quarter of a mile [0.40 km], and one drop of either acetone gem-dithiol or the mother liquors from crude trithioacetone crystallisations were placed on a watch glass in a fume cupboard. The odour was detected downwind in seconds.
#+end_quote

I have no idea why authoritarian regimes don't use it to disperse riots and protesters. Doesn't even seem to have lasting side effects.

Anyway, outside of military and 'peace keeping' applications, what uses can you think of for it? Again, this is a real chemical a high schooler could make. The most exotic thing you need to make it is a Bunsen burner.

Presumably because they don't want random people vomiting and/or passing out hundreds of yards away from the protesters.

There is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_(weapon)][precedent]] for stinky substances in crowd control, but the concept hasn't seemed to have gotten much success outside Israel.

*** Curious that the scientists didn't smell the fact that they were contaminated--so intense point-blank that it overloaded their smell receptors, maybe?
