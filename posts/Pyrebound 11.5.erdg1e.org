Didn't get time to post an update here yesterday when the actual update went on. Then forgot about it. Derp!

[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/01/19/chapter-11-5/]]

Pyrebound is a high-fantasy serial, about 150K so far, set in a grim Mesopotamian-themed world. A little bit coming-of-age, a lot of murderous political intrigue. Click [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]] if you'd like to start from the beginning. Thanks!


** Idle question: would the world of Pyrebound make an interesting board game? The only modern board games I've played are Catan and one round of Castle Panic with my nephew, but I can see PB fitting into the general mold of a Catan-ish game.

You start with all players setting up new pyres at sites along a river. Turns progress in four stages, a season each for the bloom, harvest, war, and a spring "building" stage where you can decide to construct dropmills, housing, or other amenities. You have to gradually build up the land, start new hearths, allocate spirits every bloom to handmaidens, flamekeepers, and ens, and so on. Other players can be sabotaged with blackbands or moonchildren in various ways, and there are plenty of things to go wrong. Victory is defined by, I guess, achieving a certain status for your pyre first?

EDIT: On reflection, there's no reason it couldn't be simple pen and paper (or electronic files, whatever). The actual layout of the pyres would be irrelevant to gameplay, as they don't compete for land and all land in PB is about equally worthless until it's improved. The resources would be population (of various classes), gold, and prestige, the latter being recalculated every bloom based on performance. First player to reach a given prestige benchmark wins.

Prestige is also valuable for other things; blackbands won't hire out to pyres below a given prestige, and some amenities like a tegnembassaga or a tinap creche are likewise unavailable for little podunk settlements. The trick would be to balance the different routes to prestige--it could be earned by amassing wealth, leading the Dominion in war against bazuu, building lots of hearths, or what-have-you. Hiring blackbands risks prestige--getting caught sabotaging other pyres is shameful, though everyone does it.

*** Y'know, i think it would make for a neat game.

I disagree about land competition/pyre layout not occurring/mattering however. If mechanically, bazuu roosts attack the area around them rather than board wide, and the war has a resolution roll that includes failure and a horde attacking a pyre, then competing for land so as to be encircled by other pyres to act as armor and ensure your own hearths are physically close for some measure of protection might be a strategy on the construction side. So yeah land is worthless for resources, but having other players surround you would be advantageous.(?) Also, if land/tiles get improved by proximity to pyrelight/turns, snatching up rival lands with your own hearths that are slightly better than the wastes before they settle their own might also occur.

**** In practice, they tend to be strung out along a river for water access (with the exception of Dul Jatu, which is an oddball). However, geography could be relevant in that more rugged land would be better for quarrying or mining, whereas flatlands produce superior farms. Having distant tiles themselves improve over time would involve a lot of modifying the board manually, I think; I was imagining a system where you can overlay new improvements on the old in successive turns to sim soil improvement.

Wheat farm 2 replaces wheat farm 1, etc. Different farm types would have different outputs--wheat produces lots of food but no money, orchards produce less food and some cash, forests like Dul Karagi's are good for cash and a bit of prestige but take a big investment to make. Not sure how pasture would work. Easy investment, low total payout? Farm, Orchard, Pasture, Vineyard, or Forest, with limited land to use. A single ring of hexes per hearth, double for your pyre itself.

***** If it was an actual boardgame rather than something electronic, yeah, swapping/overlaying tiles would become a chore, point.

I was just initially imagining that, as in the story, taking advantage of land improved by another pyre's light (Dul Jatu and the twin pyres improving a lot of ranchland) another player may try to muscle in on improved but out of range land.

If improvement is done only on a settlement basis, that element is removed and only the bazuu roost locations would drive a specific tactic like encirclement by others..but with river layouts, that's unlikely to work out well unless you can settle a river delta and thus be away from mountains/hills, where roosts might pop in. But being away from hills means losing out to mines, especially gold and iron/copper/tin mines, which if construction requires resource cards, makes trade a priority.

Can you trade for minerals with the tinapi? Speaking either for a theoretical game or in story. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule][These nodule things could be smelted down for metals, maybe.]]

Also, do murrush ever go into war with humanity? I would assume if the army failed they would be enlisted to help stop the horde from sweeping through the pyre and hearths, but do they ever go out into the field, or just stay at home being guards and forges?

****** Actually, that is an interesting tradeoff--mineral access versus safety. I'm on the fence about resource cards as such, because I don't know how many different collectibles I'd want players to keep track of. If players already have to keep track of various population units, all the special buildings in their pyre, gold, and prestige, do I want them to accumulate cards for ore, stone, etc.? Or do I want it so that the price of improvements varies based on how much you "have access to"?

For example, if you control X quarries, or have bartered with one or more other players for the fruits of same, all stone-based buildings are substantially cheaper to purchase. Food production is tallied every fall, and any shortfall means population and prestige loss. Varied food sources speed population growth by making a healthier populace. This is something similar to what I remember of the resource model in Civ 4.

The tinapi commonly serve as middlemen in trade. I could see them being used for trade with pyres "off the map," and for acquiring any number of useful things from various sources--but the price might be steep. In-game, I imagine a sufficiently prestigious pyre being able to attract tinap merchants. Any such trade model might be awkward or cheese-able sans resource unit tallies, though. Possibly the default cost represents having to import the goods from off-map, and if you get tinapi to build a creche in your pyre that default cost drops?

Murrush are extremely hard to kill, and quite scary, but have the twin liabilities of sluggishness and low fertility. Put a murrush up against a horde of shabti and it will reliably burn and smash any who run into it--but they could effortlessly dodge around it, and no pyre is likely to have more than about five (Misishi is an exception, due to their singular focus on mining). They also eat a lot.

Thanks for all your input--I like the way you think!

****** I started creating a prototype ruleset ([[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/pyrebound-the-game]]), then realized I still didn't have a complete update written for next week. It's less than half-complete, not even proofread properly, and probably too complicated. But it's there.

(Will probably have to take a one-week hiatus before next update--that was due to happen anyway, though. Ambush by inspiration was just an aggravating factor.)

******* If you haven't heard about it before, Tabletop simulator might help you playtest this with a custom board so you can actually see how things go. A few years back there was this card based wargame that used it to great extent to refine out the actual gameplay before comitting to print, iirc. I doubt you plan on doing anything so fancy, but it might prove fun for you to try out.

*** Lugals of Catan? :)

You could replace the bandit with a malevolent runaway Ensi. Not sure how white days would work, but it'd be an interesting mechanic to work in somehow.

** A brutal bombing of civilians by a power-hungry warlord. It is difficult to see Ram as any sort of naive hero or freedom fighter anymore. A great blow in what seems like the start of a class war.

*** Why don't you quarterback it? Say you're in Ram's position. You have yourself, Shimrun, Shennai (knack for assassination), Mana (unusual power for age), Rinti (unexceptional tween handmaiden), and Pimna (doesn't want to be there). Busu's incapacitated, but you've got his sword. Darun's fine and willing to help. Aside from that, you have a dented skybarque and oh, what was it, six recently freed bondsmen? They are talented at handling livestock. You have reasonable freedom, but all plans must be run through the wishy-washy Shimrun. What do you do?

EDIT: This challenge is open to any and all readers, of course.
