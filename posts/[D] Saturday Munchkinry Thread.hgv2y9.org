Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Imagine a tiny fraction of the population has the power to know when someone is deliberately lying to them. 0.1% at most. These people find their way into the professions you'd think - journalists, judges, lawyers, business of every kind. A lot of them are just consultants selling their services to whoever needs a lie detector at the moment.

You don't have that power. However, you seem to be the first person (whom you know of) who can lie without triggering their lie detectors. How would you use your 'immunity'? If you are caught in a lie news will certainly spread that people with immunity exist.

If however, the insane and deluded can already work around the lie detecting power, you aren't really unique other than being less insane than people that have already pulled your con before.

From the original post "deliberately lying to them" means that people that are genuinely deluded probably already beat the lie detecting power, so society probably already has a way of ignoring religious nutcases.

Lie detectors believe you are telling the truth, because the odds of you being delusional or mistaken are way too low. So your company stocks skyrocket, and you reap massive profits.

People will later discover you were lying, but by then you have run away with large sums of money.

(2) Back in Hoseph Smith's day, you might get drunk or eat some totally-not-psychotropic substances and literally see God the Father and Jesus Christ walk into the room, or just knock your brain into an altered state with meditation, proper framing, etc. and see the same thing. Wasn't /common/, but it wasn't unheard of, either.

Nowadays, though, spiritual experience = "nice feeling in your heart" and even major church authorities (Mormonism's equivalent to Catholicism's cardinals) have said in recent decades that they've never experienced a miracle.

First, be caught out being able to lie, in a public way that cannot be denied. It's possible (and even probable) that there are other liars out there who have some stake in suppressing the idea that lying is possible.

Once the cat's safely out of the bag, volunteer for scientific study and lobby for political reform.

The political system of the world that you describe wouldn't have any defense against corruption, beyond asking politicians whether or not they're corrupt. If there are liars, the system needs to be reformed before people can worm themselves into positions where they can lie, and be believed, and cause damage by doing so, because this will obviously happen sooner or later. If this has already happened, which you have to assume, the urgency is even greater.

** You have the powers of [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Crawler][Crawler]] from Worm. It can be summed up as very fast permanent adaptive regeneration. If you get cut, your skin heals back tougher to cuts. If you get burned, your body heals back more resistant to burns, etc. You still feel the pain, but only at first. Your body will slowly adapt to that too. This can and will add mass to your body, and make the shape of your body inhuman over time (by the time we see crawler in worm, he's a van sized six legged monster).

This adaptation works on /everything,/ from dimensional shearing to mental attacks and time bubbles. However, you have to keep in mind that too much of one type of damage could turn you into an invincible "rock," so you have to constantly find new ways to damage yourself in order to become stronger and more durable.

Say that you start off as a normal human being of good mental health. How do you use your powers as Crawler for good (i.e. not evil) while balancing your mental health as much as possible?

*** Let's start with the assumption that you can do far more with an excellent mind than with an excellent body.

First, I wonder how far "adaptive" goes. If you are damaged in a way that reduces your capacity, do you regenerate with more of that capacity? For example, if you lose a lung, does your lung grow back with more capacity to protect against the possibility of future loss of the other lung, or just harder to lose? If the former, and "capacity" is broadly enough defined, targeted brain injury could increase your capacity to think in ways the targeted regions supported.

However, this requires a few things to go right at once, and we may imagine our power may not be so accommodating. So second, we look into other ways to protect our brain from damage by first damaging it, even if it doesn't directly translate into an abstract notion of capacity. Oxygen deprivation comes to mind; I imagine some potential adaptations to that could result on greater capacity of some kind. If there are drugs which have permanent negative neurological consequences, those might also be good candidates, especially if they can be injected such that the brain is the /first/ line of defense (so that the adaptation doesn't happen in other systems, such as the liver). If drugs work, you could avoid finding an undesirable local maximum by varying types of drugs; some days you overdose on stimulants and other days on depressants, some days hallucinogens and other days anti-psychotics.

However, these might provide incremental progress, but not life-changing progress. What you really want is not entirely unlike a neural network, in which a bad decision has consequences directly down the line of neurons most responsible for it. We probably can't get that granular, but with a PET scanner and a series of lasers, it might be possible to target /areas/ engaged in certain sorts of activity if they lead to undesired decisions.

This also depends heavily on the power's understanding of "adaptive". In order to avoid adapting to the lasers, you might have to pair it with some system that a) requires radiation to operate and b) causes harm by ceasing to operate; sort of a dead man's switch that goes off if, say, you adapt radiation-resistant skin. I don't know if an adaptation would be reverted if it caused harm like that, but if the system were operating continuously, it seems plausible.

**** Broadly speaking, you do indeed regenerate with higher capacity. For example losing a lung will make the current lung much tougher to lose, and as it struggles to oxygenate the whole body it will adapt to become massively more efficient and powerful.

As a rule of thumb though, the more traumatic the injury the more wild the adaptations can be. The loss of both lungs may turn the body into a tree like lifeform where the body doesn't need lungs to oxygenate. It could just as easily transform into a lifeform that doesn't require oxygen.

The problem with the laser/radiation thing is that all adaptations are permanent and cumulative. You would adapt to the radiation, then the dead man's switch. The power adapts to any harm, which includes damage done by other adaptations. I imagine that the threat of turning into an invincible "rock" would be enough to stop any abuse of adaptation feedback loops. Your best bet would be to use a series of progressively more powerful lasers to damage the neurons, and once you're immune to lasers of very high power try other methods (like cutting, vibration, blunt force, etc.)

*** I haven't read Worm, but I think this would have to be extensively tested to see how it works and get a better understanding of the underlying mechanism and how to predict the changes that might result based on that. For some example tests (which hopefully will be done with anesthesia):

- Do severed body parts or does spilled blood regenerate at all or display any anomalous effects? If not, you might be an amazing blood and organ donor. However, if there /are/ anomalous effects, then, could your donated blood or organs regenerate a person who receives them? There are likely many terminally-ill patients who would be happy to volunteer for a clinical trial with this. Even if it's not medically useful, you could still provide a consensual [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa][HeLa]] substitute which might even have industrial applications if it can be cultured into useful products.

- What happens if you receive an organ or tissue transplant? Does the transplanted tissue gain the regeneration ability as well? If so, does it retain that regeneration if it's later removed again? Could you do organ rehabilitation on behalf of other people?

- How far does this regeneration apply? Will it affect hair or nails when you cut them? What about the upper layer of dead skin cells? If there's no regeneration of these, then any hard non-cellular growths that you don't want could probably be safely removed without triggering the regeneration.

- What happens if someone amputates the tip of your pinky finger, leaving just a short flap of skin at the bottom, and then sutures the flap over the end of the nub and puts a cast or brace over the tip to block regrowth for a few days or weeks? Will the fingertip still regenerate after it has already 'healed'? In a similar vein, what happens if you pierce an earlobe and then put a silver wire through it to block the hole from closing up? In other words, is there any way to prevent unwanted regeneration of living tissue?

- Do you actually get stronger if you get injured in a variety of ways? For example, what would be the comparative difference if you had one pinky finger cut off, burned, frozen, crushed in a hydraulic press, dissolved in acid, tourniqueted to death, poisoned with black widow venom, irradiated, and finally belt-sanded off, versus another pinky finger which is just cut off nine times?

This means it is possible but dangerous. The Harry Potter wiki notes that Voldemort had to first fly by broomstick over the sea before appariting to Malfoy manor, thus even for a powerful wizard with a clear motivation to, apparition over long distances isn't worth it.

Even if you could manipulate your reference frame in a way that transferred speed, I would assume it would be limited by the range of the apparition, thus the Earth's rotation around the sun, much less the Andromeda galaxy, would not be usable frames of reference.

*** Exploited with portals in [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][Saga of Soul]].

#+begin_quote
  It happened far too quickly for Downfall to realize what was going on (or defend against it). One moment, a portal was opening, aimed at him from a distance of about twenty meters. The next moment, devastation.

  /Really, it only makes sense. The two ends of a portal are always stationary in relation to each other. But if you pick two geographic locations in the world? They're anything/ */but/* /stationary!/

  The news choppers filmed as the blast erupted from the portal before Soul, hitting Downfall all but instantaneously - like a column of solid devastation reaching to the ground, causing it to explode in a spectacular splash of water and gravel.

  /Because you see... The Earth is revolving eastward, and it's/ */round/* /. So at any moment, you and the patch of Earth you're standing on are going in one direction... while the patch of Earth on your antipodes is going in the/ */opposite/* /direction./

  /And the funny thing? It's going pretty fast. The Earth has a circumference of over 40,000 kilometers, and a revolution period of 24 hours. That means every spot on the equator is moving at a speed not too far from half a kilometer/ */per second/* /./

  As the dust began to clear, the cameras filmed the large steaming crater that had formed in the street; Downfall's body, badly mangled, laid on the crater's rim. The Golden Knife wasn't anywhere near him.

  /Which begs the question: What happens when I, in Japan, open a portal at the equator, somewhat to the East of South America's coast? And about half a kilometer below sea level?/

  /Answer: The most obliteratingly badass water cannon ever. Because, sure, tapping into the Marianas Trench provides pressure... But then, the water still needs time to accelerate. Here, the water is/ */already/* /going faster than a bullet. And this kind of speed means hundreds of tons of water crossing even a small portal in a single second. An energy yield measured in gigajoules, in/ */hundreds/* /of gigajoules./

  /And the scary part? That wasn't my best shot. I can think of an alternation on this technique that I'm still afraid of using due to collateral damage. For now, though.../

  Downfall's body twitched weakly as Soul landed right next to him, and affixed the anti-magic manacle to his arm. She then pointed her index at him. "Junior goddess of kick your ass."

** Sacred geometry, ritual purification, various ritual maintenance, and usage of materials with symbolic importance together can imbue large structures with a mystical/magical power that can be used to work various "miracles". These temples can be made as small and temporary as a tent (primarily used for recharging minor artifacts), but large structures tend to work faster and allow more potent effects.

For ritual purity think of the regulations observed by ancient Israelites or of Shinto ritual purity or of modern clean room standards. In general, it seems different ritual purity standards can work, although any given temple needs a particular standard of purity, i.e. one temple that uses a procedure based off a clean room will get messed up if someone ignores the clean room procedures while obeying Golden Dawn ritual purity standard.

Among the miracles:

Empowerment of artifacts. Objects treated with rituals taking hours to days can be empowered with various effects. More powerful object must be recharged at temples.

- "Probabilistic" effects most easy to empower and require minimal (recharging possible outside temples) to no recharging. I.e. someone with a cancer that has a 20% chance to go in remission has their cancer go into remission. This couldn't heal someone with below a 5% chance. If used to light a fire, would only be able to help mundane methods, for instance a spark from flint catches just right. Think of placebomancy from Unsong.

- Subtle, minimalistic interventions can go for several rechargings and/or be recharged in the field. I.e. Can heal cancer with only a 5% chance to go into remission. If used to light a fire could spontaneously heat and ignite a sufficiently flammable material.

- Direct intervention for more powerful effects require recharging, often after every use. This refers to everything that adds in an easily measurable amount of mass/energy to the world. I.e. directly destroying a tumor or generating a fireball out of nothing.

- Direct Subversion of metaphysical or physical rules might require artifact to be used within specialized temple and specialized ritual. I.e. bringing back someone that recently (past 3 days) died of cancer. Altering an object to burn without being consumed or damaged.

Other effects:

- Actualizing miracles within the temple without first empowering an artifact is slightly faster but slightly harder.

As to relationship to various religions and belief systems:

- Imitation of miracles and myths from various religious text makes miraculous effects easier to achieve. This counts for both end result, aesthetics, and method of actualization. Meeting all 3 of these makes things about one step easier, i.e. subtle to probabilistic or direct subversion to direct intervention. I.e. if you wanted to make it easier to bring someone back from the dead fully healed, you might crucify, them stab them in the side with a spear, bury them, wait 3 days, and then they would be resurrected but bearing scars.

- For words/prayers spoken, the actual higher power named seems fairly interchangeable, even for a given temple. I.e. a Wiccan that observes the ritual purity sufficiently well could use an otherwise "Shinto" temple to call for the intervention of the Triple Goddess efficaciously. Even atheists can do things like call on the shared collective unconscious of humanity. It has to be something they at least partially believe in, but other than that "faith" isn't really required.

Some hard limits:

- For resurrecting the dead: Slightly longer than 3 days without preparation before hand, 9 days if prepared before dying, much longer if they avoid truly "dying".

- In general, can't extend life indefinitely. Maintaining ritual purity might push the amount they can extend their life, but requires increasingly stringent purity standards for extending longer.

Some common examples:

- Water to wine to blood. Easy enough to perform in tents or minimally optimized temples.

- Granting super strength to someone that follows a particularly strict standard of ritual purity (i.e. Samson effect)

- Making object that perform their default function better: I.e. a knife that stays sharper and cuts better, a flashlight that always seems to catch what you are looking for in it's light, etc.

- Emergency equipment: Artifacts might expend their charge on a single use, but for a single use emergency equipment this might be okay.

A few prompts about munchkining:

- Miracles to imitate that are most exploitable?

- Most economically viable mundane applications?

- Most valuable impossible to otherwise achieve applications?

- Application most valuable to you personally?

- How would this play out in various historical settings?

How would this play out in the modern world if it was discovered/demonstrated in recent times?

*** I mean obviously every hospital would immediately become a highly sanctified space and work lot better without any real changes; they already have all sorts of purity rituals going on all the time, with every person ritualistically cleansing themselves between jobs and every room and every tool going through a purification ritual multiple times a day. The fact that these rituals work even if there isn't any magic doesn't make them stop being rituals.

The real change you'd get, IMO, is synthetic corporate religions.

Like, every McDonalds would become a ritually sanctified space oriented around producing the best-tasting food possible out of the ingredients, while using the cheapest and fastest purification rituals (probably only what's legally required of them by law).

Then there'd be the markets and subsidiary activities around religions. You'd have corporate religious consultants, who'll sell you a training and materials contract for the Church of the Machine God (guaranteed to improve factory productivity by 20% with at least 90% employee buy-in), you'd have religious engineering as a field of study in order to figure out how to purify on the cheap, you'd have basic research into religion in order to figure out theoretical questions (is space pure? if we launch a space station, can it be an eternally sanctified and pure temple? if it can be an eternally sanctified temple, can it generate oxygen indefinitely via some sort of Maxwell's Demon-style probabilistic CO2 cracking?)

The more significant proportions, symmetries, and shapes worked into the architecture the more mystical power it can channel and the faster it can channel it.

**** I wonder if the miracles are recursive? Can you make an artifact that can use up its own charge to power another artifacts'? You could then just make miracle batteries and have them dropped off at any place needing to use miracles. If so, could you enchant water or electricity as though they were artifacts with this property? Then you could just pipe the miracle juice to wherever you need to fuel miracles. Or could you even have these artifacts charge other artifacts remotely, wirelessly?

Also, what happens when you pit one artifact against another? Suppose the police have an artifact flashlight that's awfully good at finding criminals trying to hide, but suppose the criminal has an equally charged hooded cloak that makes them less likely to get noticed? Does whoever have the more powerful enchantment win?

Can machines or programs perform rituals? Can machines aid rituals? Does it depend on sentience, or being alive? Could a trained dog, or engineered yeast, perform a ritual?

  Can you make a processor whose stochastic algorithms always seem to find correct solutions more quickly than expected?
#+end_quote

If you have a sufficiently random source of randomness, and the randomness is appropriately used in the algorithm, that should work. It's probabilistic, so it falls under the doesn't need recharging level of mystical power usage. It might not be exactly consistent in how much faster it is... if the algorithm has a 20% chance of finishing with x time and a 5% chance of finishing in y time (without intervention), then the actual time will vary between x and y.

  Also, can robots perform miracle rituals? You mention that the miracle worker needs to believe in and invoke something---can e.g. convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet believe in and somehow invoke dogs?
#+end_quote

Theoretically possible, but tedious to implement. The convolutional neural network would need a "body" sufficient to carry out rituals including miscellaneous gestures, movements of objects, some spoken phrases. For every action that is part of the ritual, the network would need to be trained sufficiently to have a "belief" in it. So it wouldn't just need to "believe" in dogs it would also need to have an internal symbolic reasoning which relates those beliefs in words/gestures/ceremonies. And it would all need to be a single coherent thing, not a bunch of independently trained networks.

** While power is supplied to the system, you have direct, conscious control (with subconscious instincts for the fine details) over all interconnected aspects of the transit system you're currently riding on, limited to a single mode of transit. The power supply must be appropriate to the system; electricity or fuel or horses or slave laborers are sufficient.

If you're riding an articulated bus in a combined bus, streetcar, and light-rail system, you only have control of the buses - but if the system has long, short, and articulated buses, you get control over all the buses, and the fareboxes and vending machines that support the bus system, as well as fuel pumps, maintenance bays, and bus-prioritizing traffic lights.

If you're riding on a train that connects with the greater freight-rail system, you only control trains that are part of your

Err... so you have mass mind control powers then? As in, as long as you can trick someone into being part of your transit system, you can control their every action?

For example, you can trick someone into carrying you by pretending to be injured. You could get inside a burning building, then the firemen would carry you out. Once you are carried, do you now gain control over the "firemen" transit system? Control firemen all over the city because they are in a sense, an interconnected transit system?

**** This is a good question. I think what separates firefighters from a slave-powered transit system is that the primary purpose of firefighters as an organization is not general transportation of passengers.

Ambulance services, though, are part of a network dedicated to transportation.

There must be a vehicle for your power to control; the vehicle's motive system is controlled by your power but not the driver or other staff of the system. You would have mind control of the horses and the slaves as they pull your chariot, but not their driver, and not the horses or slaves when they no longer pull the chariot.

*** So, I hear there's this guy employed by the train station. Every morning, he rides the train in to work. When he gets there, he writes out and presents a report on the train system. Pointing out every last little thing that's wrong, or needs fixing, in the entire network. No-one knows how he finds his info; the train company just pays attention to his reports.

There's a guy employed by the bus company on a similar basis, but he only works afternoons. Some sort of special arrangement.

.../surely/ they're not the same guy. Surely?

** This may have been done before in some form, if so I apologize.

Someone with an eidetic memory is able to recall an image with extremely precise, accurate detail after seeing it once. The term is also used to refer to being able to remember other sensory details.

How would you munchkin having an eidetic kinesthetic memory?

The ability to memorize and recall physical movements with perfect precision and accuracy for the rest of your life after only performing them once. There are no cognitive trade-offs for this power. There are also no limits to how many of these memories you can store. They'll all be consolidated into your muscle memory ready to be recalled as you choose. Note that they'd have to be attached to a stimulus to become unconscious reflexes.

*** Perfect precision you say?

Could you write out the times table for all pairs of 10 digit numbers, and thus gain the ability to instantly multiply any pair of 10 digit numbers by remembering what you wrote for that specific pair?

Could you take it one step further and essentially memorize anything you can write down?

Could you learn to draw pictures, so as to capture visual images in terms of your movements needed to draw the image?
