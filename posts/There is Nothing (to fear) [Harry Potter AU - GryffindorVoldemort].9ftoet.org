I've waited a bit to post this because I wasn't quite sure whether it would end up being appropriate for the subreddit, but I'm feeling pretty confident about it now.

This series explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

This is /mostly/ a For Want of a Nail-type story, with everything proceeding as expected up until the Sorting Hat is put on Tom Riddle's head and makes an observation, and an argument, that it hadn't made in canon.

The series can be found on Archive of Our Own [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][here]], on Sufficient Velocity [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.49249/][here]], and on Spacebattles [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/][here]]. If you're interested in conversation beyond the subreddit, then there's more of that on SB than SV.


** Wait, he's a Gryffindor but he makes /less/ "rash and ill-advised decisions"?

*** If his terrible decisions were a result of blind, stupid panic, then learning to get a handle on his fears could improve his decision-making.

*** Well, it's hard to get worse after unleashing a basilisk on the school with "blame that kindly dumb kid if you get caught" as your main backup plan, or carving off a chunk of your soul and sticking it in your dairy while you're 16.

He probably just became so irresponsible he looped back around to responsible.

** Well, this looks pretty interesting; I've always enjoyed the compassionate evil overlord trope.

** My suspension of disbelief is a put out by how easily most of these people cede their morals to Tom Riddle, but I can see the effort that was made to justify them (Sirius being a burgeoning fanatic with a recently dead friend's murderer in front of him, Flitwick having tunnel vision of dueling glory, etc.)

Ah, well. In general it was very enjoyable and well put together. I like the pace and points of view the story is being told from so far... glad it was posted here.

*** Thank you!

Sirius always seemed to me to be on the knife's edge anyway. Remember, it's canon that he almost got Snape eaten by a werewolf.

As for Filius, I tried to convey that Tom doesn't exactly look like a budding dark lord at the moment. He's got some issues, and an older Filius probably would have dealt with those issues differently, but the Filius that we're seeing here is almost fifty years younger than the one that we're introduced to when Harry goes to Hogwarts.

** I like this. Voldemort-in-different-houses is my favorite genre of HP fanfic, though I've only read one other. I forget the name, but it was about a Voldemort that was sorted into Hufflepuff, and so focused far more on self-improvement and leadership then he did on plotting, cunning or blood purity, and ended up having a much easier time gaining power because of it.

A Voldemort in Gryffindor, and once I finish this, all I'll need to do is find a Ravenclaw!Voldemort fic to complete my collection :)

*** Perhaps you were thinking of insurgere? And if not, now there's another one for your collection.

"Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that."

*** I did write a [Ravenclaw!Tom Riddle fic] a few years ago, but I have to warn you that it isn't up to the caliber of my present work.

You /have/ gotten me thinking on about trying my hand at it again, but that won't be for a long time (there's another story that I want to work on once my GRiddle Fic is complete). For now I'll just say that Riddleclaw is going to have a very interesting study club.
