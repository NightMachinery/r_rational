The lich is not a Controller. The lich does not have a soul marker that actively responds to the presence of Keys.

But it's also possible for the keys to persist in some other fashion, eg you bring one of them to the Gate, the Guardian registers that you brought it, and you get extra privileges, without needing to bring that one back again.

If he ever gets the hang of compulsions (which were used by Cyorian matriarch), he could make his simulacrums a lot more safe and productive. Imagine all of them having the compulsion to not work against Zorian, and focus on their jobs.

Wonder what else he could do to their minds? Make them re-purpose parts of their minds for specific tasks, like learning the local language, so that original Zorian can just 'download' the lessons from them? Or maybe completely change the senses and perspectives of some of them, so they can come to some real creative solutions (I mean, just a few near-death experiences changed the Zorian from the grey hunter ambush somewhat).

Simulacrum have their own mind. This is supported by the fact that the simulacrum need to give original Zorian memories vs. intrinsically already having the memories if they shared the same mind. If you fuck the simulacrum's mind up, just dispell the simulacrum. I'm pretty sure it was fleshed out more concretely somewhere else that part of simulacrum creation is the creation of a fake mind but I can't find it right now. The only precaution is that you probably want to incapacitate the simulacrum in case it goes insane and starts randomly lashing out.

***** Fair enough, /however/ the immediate danger is not the most important one.

Let's consider following scenario: there's a significant modification to fake!Zorian. This modification doesn't cause any apparent insanity, but it does make this simulacrum hostile towards Zorian, and intelligent enough to not show it.

Let's also say that evil!Zorian is dispatched to deal with a task (like searching libraries in Kotch), and is far away from Zorian.

That gives evil!Zorian a lot of possibilities when it comes to potentially harm Zorian:

- He can learn a special spell, potion or technique, or just come up with a way to disable Zorian
- He can stealthily modify other Simulacrums, so that they will work together against the original
- He can give Zorian inconspicuous information for future evil!Zorians to use to further their own plans ('Hmmm? Advanced mind magic? Using potions to increase your psychic powers? Quite useful'). It's even more potent if the simulacrum will be dispelled after a set period of time (Remember that prank they pulled off with Akoja? Now imagine they went a step further...).
- He can even, in the end-game, escape the loop instead of the real!Zorian (just like alleged simulacrum of Zach's did).

***** hahaha I like your honesty! I was curious about this as well. I forget if the answer to the following was fully explained.

So, to get to Koth in the first place, Zorian used mental relays to inform his simulacrum in Koth that it was time to construct the gate spell?

Or did they agree to check in with each other via the gate spell at regular intervals?

And then perhaps before the black box, Daimen found someone among the Taramatulas to create the Koth side of the gate. The Taramatulas are collecting powerful mages after all. Although, I feel it would be a house liability to link with an unknown gate source.

Perhaps having Daimen learn gate /is/ the easiest solution. Could he really learn it so quickly though? It took Zorian a lot of time learning dimensionalism before he could successfully cast gate, which I believe is the pinnacle of the common variety of dimensional magic (with dimensional pockets the purview of exceedingly rare dimensional magic).

Daimen also spent a lot of time studying dimensionalism. It's just that the Gate spell is rare and treated as a closely-held secret by mages that can cast it, so he never found anyone willing to teach it to him.

Since Zorian is still in Cyoria, he and thus the simulacrum will have very high manna regeneration, and can thus teleport often. This should be doable right?

He doesn't go into his calculations, but this is his story and he is an accountant after all.

Tired simulacrum are a non-issue, tired Zorian is, a few chapters back it was mentioned that they go inactive if he's sleeping. Presumably it would be Zach carting him around and teleporting him while he sleeps, and the same for when Zach is sleeping.

Mana regeneration caps out at anything higher than a rank 3 mana well, so being in Cyoria (rank 9) isn't truly necessary or helpful. The 30 minute estimate for mana doesn't take into account simulacra either, and I think Zorian caps out at 3 simulacra right now, which slows his mana regeneration to a trickle, making repeated long range teleports impractical. I think Zorian's just using 2 or so at a time at the moment, so that he and the simulacra have some spare mana for casting spells.

I get the impression now that his simulacra is still mostly relying on paying people to do teleports, and only occasionally using his own mana for it.

Using his information of 200 teleports, and 1 teleport every 30 minutes, which seems to be a high estimate given that both Zorian and Zach seem to be able to teleport more often than that, even with simulacrum of Zorian running around, I get around 4.4 days nonstop work, so then 6 days might be a good estimate without powernapping.

nobody103 has said in a couple places that he had done a lot of world building, and then decided it would be fun/worthwhile to try writing in the world and figuring out/adding new stuff to it, which I think we're all appreciative of.

I don't think either you or thrawnca or I are entirely content with his math, but like I said, he's the author. Even after adding in 12 hours for the two extended range teleports that require long rituals, it still feels like the Koth trip should be shorter to me too.

Mostly though, it would feel like a waste for the characters to spend a big chunk of their limited remaining time (maybe a fifth of it?) just traveling to get to necessary locations, and that will be an even bigger issue for the other Key pieces on other continents later. So there was a need for Z&Z to develop a faster method of travel, such as the Bakora Gates.

*********** One thing I overlooked in my initial maths was that mana regeneration is significantly reduced by the presence of active simulacra. Each one costs nearly a third of his regeneration, and since the point of sending one to Koth is to stay productive, he'll probably want to keep at least two around. So paying people - which could be optimised - remains much more attractive.

It's tough to get a good idea of exactly how far they can go with the basic teleport spell, or how much of their reserves get used up for a max range teleport. Judging from the maps, Cirin to Cyoria or Kynazov Dveri really should be near the range limit for the spell.

Here's my list of factors that affect the mana consumption of teleport:

*Divination component (reduced by divination shaping mastery)

*Dimensional component (reduced by dimensional shaping mastery)

*Range (influences both divination and dimensional components)

*Additional weight (passengers)

*Familiarity with destination (influences divination component)

***** I would like to suggest a solution. Since Zorian's simulacra already pointed safe places to put down relays (and open a gate, sometimes), then it is make sense if Zorian can simply chain-teleport through the them, albeit needing some time to replenish mana. This way, Zorian can cut the time to move from Eldemar to Koth. As a note, this is only applicable for Zorian who's just exiting the blackroom. Fresh restart will involve uncertain factors on relays' location that might hinder safe teleportation.

***** I just thought of another potential issue. How rare is the Gate spell?

Presumably you have more than one person in each country who knows the Gate spell. It can't be that rare can it? Lets put a theoretical lower bound of one person per country. Say this Gate spell user from Country A has a vendetta against Country B. He could groom a loyal student such that the student learns the Gate spell, no matter how long it takes. The student then goes through the bureaucracy of international travel (Chapter 64, where it states teleporting between countries is slow because of nations wanting to secure their borders). The student then opens a dimensional gate with the help of the teacher connecting Country A to Country B allowing for an invasion.

You wouldn't even need a vendetta. If there is any mage who knows the gate spell under a warmongering government, it seems like it makes it extremely easy for discreet mass movements of people.

So if this is a well known method on how to use the Gate spell, in a world where it seems like there are plenty of imperialistic governments and ill sentiments (Noble houses resenting current governments), it would put the instability of this world at an unrealistic level.

You indicate [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/622at6/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_67/dfjhwls/]] here that other mages do in fact use the gate spell like this, which is why I assume that the spell isn't so rare that there are only a handful of people in the entire world who know how to use it.

****** If you looked at the political map of Altazia, you would immediately see that states do indeed have a lot of issues holding themselves together...

That aside, the thing that makes such Gate use impractical for invasions is that:

1. In MoL-verse, there are no mages that can solo entire armies by themselves. If you want to conquer a country, you need to bring an army. Gating in a small battlegroup would be insufficient to even conquer the tiny statelets that exist between major nations.

2. Transporting an entire army in this way would be very slow. Armies are big things with thousands of people, and they come with supplies, war machines, war beasts, and so on.

3. States routinely run patrols and divination of their territory. This is not enough to catch individual mages like Z&Z or small groups violating border security, but any attempt to establish a beachhead for an invasion would be caught very quickly.

4. You cannot supply an army with a single mage gating in things. So this maneuver would quickly see your invasion force run out of ammo, food and such.

5. The student is vulnerable to assassination, and you can bet that the defenders will pull every trick they can to get rid of him (and thus the army's ability to gate reinforcements).

6. If you get put into a bad situation, you cannot easily retreat because you are deep in enemy territory and have no fallback point. You could lose the entire invasion force very easily if things go wrong.

7. There are more than two nations in any given region. If you are committing your army to a distant battlefield, you cannot defend against your regional enemies.

The end result is that a Gate can only be used in this way to conduct raids, terror missions and spitefully go down in a blaze of glory. Which is indeed a known danger. Countries generally try not to back powerful mages and groups into corners because then they have a tendency to use their 'last resort' type magics... and all powerful mages and groups have at least one of those.

** After reading this chapter, I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed. It's a well-written chapter with an efficient progression of the plot, but I was expecting drama with Daimen and to see a confrontation between the brothers over Zorian's psychic abilities and whether or not Daimen has any. I was even hoping to see more of Taramatulas to better understand the family but they barely say anything.

Basically, everyone was in character and mature enough to not act like people on a sit-com, but the chapter wasn't as exciting as I was hoping for and the cliffhanger was obvious coming from chapter #66.

The biggest point of interest is how from the very first meeting, one of the Taramatulas telepathically probed Zorian. It says a lot about a family if a member is so willing to do something potentially politically dangerous so soon after a first meeting. What it says is the question.

Daimen using mind blank so casually makes me think he had reason to worry about mind mages from the Taramatulas in addition to Zorian.

That's probably because we're in the middle of an arc. There wasn't much tension when Zorian was wandering around the countryside working for Gurey or delving in Knyazov Dveri's dungeon, either.

I have no doubt that the tension will return when they have to fight in the real world, where death is permanent, the primordial might actually get loose, Red Robe may still be unaccounted for judging by how things are going on that front, the invaders have an army of demons added in, and they'll have to deal with Quatach-Ichl /permanently/ in some fashion. Bearing in mind that they have no idea where his phylactery is on Ulquaan Ibasa, it likely has insane defences, and if they banish him, he's powerful enough to teleport back with his new body within hours, and he'll be out for blood (or souls).

If the Taramatulas used mind magic I would expect one of:

- Lots of probes: mind magic users that aren't worried about exposing themselves like the aranea. They would likely be open about mind magic as well, since their use of it would be obvious to anybody else with much mind magic experience.
- A few skilled probes: trained and careful mind magic users who don't want to be exposed. They don't expect someone with aranea-caliber mind magic. A youth wouldn't be allowed to go probing people randomly because it could expose the whole house.
- No probes: they know what they're dealing with an don't want to be exposed.

A single probe from a youngster doesn't fit for me. That suggests they're not public about mind magic, but also aren't careful enough to keep their youngsters in line.

I don't think she's a canary (i.e. they ordered her to probe him) either. The worst case for them would be the probe turning Zorian hostile and him ripping the knowledge about mind magic out of her head.

Honestly, the fact that mind magic is critical for their bee-keeping specialization, and one of their members tried to use mind magic on Zorian makes the theory more likely to me.

Damien is a natural mind mage (Not sure if the Taramatula are or not.), a genius known across his home country, has huge reserves of magic, and is looking for whatever hidden treasures the lost Ikosian emperor died with in Koth.

****** There's not actually direct causation between "can cast Mind Blank" and "can take on the whole aranean web"; rather, being able to cast MB /implies/ a powerful caster, who presumably has sufficient combat skills to take on the web. Theoretically we could imagine a highly specialised caster who actually has no combat skills at all, but Novelty was making a point about using MB in combat.

On the other hand, Daimen cannot be careless if his little brother's life is at stake in light of high-skill magic demonstrated by suspicious Zorian-shaped guy. It's full of restrained excitement!

** What if the giant bees are actually highly intelligent and psychic? (sort of Koth's analogue of aranea).

The bees are the ones mind-controlling the Taramatula family, not the other way around, pretending to be dumb servant animals to maintain the illusion in the eyes of other human communities. That's their way of attaining power and safety, kind of like how the Cyorian aranea planned to integrate into Cyorian society.

That'd also explain their interest in Daimen - as they would instantly recognize him as "Open".

But that doesn't mean much, Aopes aren't Open either.

I think Orissa knows that Daimen is a psychic, but more importantly knows he is an untrained one. He doesn't know his full value and thus is easier to bargain with. And as a house relying on mind magic, they are /really/ interested to weave some innate ability into their family tree. Remember how Tinami got excited at the prospect of becoming a psychic through some dangerous untested experiment? Same here, through good old safe matrimony.

I wonder whether Daimen's recent failures in his searches are purely coincidental or are a result of sabotage from bee family, though.
