** 7/10 on the old rationality scale. /s

More seriously, if the work has at least some focus on thinking, with care and attention toward internal consistency, it's probably okay, but if a bunch of stuff happens that doesn't make sense, prepare to get ripped to shreds. Generally speaking, the mods won't remove stuff that's "not rational enough", but the community will (probably) downvote stuff that fails the sniff test.

** To be blunt, there's more chance that your story fails to pick up interest because you lack experience as a writer, than because it's not rational enough.

Just write whatever you want, and post it here. Don't worry about sticking to imaginary standards of rationalness.

** Villains have reasons as to why they're villains

People act like how people would react, none of that hollywood crap.

The established rules of the world are followed unless there is a exception and there can only be an exception when it is either set-up, or there is a reason as to why that exception exists.

Rational fiction tends to be self-aware and subverts tropes.

** If it meets any of the criteria in the sidebar, it counts. The merit of the writing is a separate issue that can't be judged til people can read it, but this is generally a pretty supportive community.

*** That seems... very broad. Especially points #2 (motivations) and maybe #5 (world-building) are very common in fiction - ASoIaF seems to fulfil #2, and probably #5 as well, yet I would not readily qualify it as rational fiction. I would also very much hesitate to qualify Captain America: Civil War as a rational work, but it does rather thoroughly explore #2 - probably more thoroughly than, say, HPN20.

I'm not sure I could myself propose a guideline, but it seems to me that #1 is the most important watershed between rational and non-rational fiction, and everything else is merely supportive. I'm not sure if it is a /good/ idea to define rational fiction that way (#2 + #5 seems a very good guideline for "good stories", even if they are not "rational" by lacking #1), but it seems to be closest to what most people intuitively qualify as rational fiction.

This is rather uncommon. Most authors just start writing, and make shit up as they go with little concern for consistency with previous canon.

**** I would definitely recommend asoiaf to people who like rational fiction so seems pretty appropriate to me.

Only reason it isn't recommended is everyone knows about it. Be like recommending Tolkien

** It doesn't have to be rational at all in order to justify a recommendation if it's something like hard sci-fi (and you explain why you recommended it in the post, well enough to get it approved). SEE: everytime Netflix makes a vaguely science-fiction themed TV show, or when Silicon Valley did a Roko's Basilisk joke. For self-promotion and regular posting, the unwritten rules are a little more stringent, but generally, if you've made the attempt to be rational, it's worth posting here, even if only for discussion or critique. I know [[/u/alexanderwales]] doesn't like chapter spam (which is why WtC updates in chunks, IIRC) but that's not going to get you stopped unless it's really low-effort. I'd advise making a post introducing your story when you write the first chapter, and then worry about subsequent discussions when you've gotten over the [[https://writingcooperative.com/that-dreaded-30-000-word-wall-8b7fb8d71bd0][30,000 word hump]] and are sure you can be consistent. If your story /really/ impresses people then they'll start posting your discussions for you. But you can always message the mods just to be safe.

(sorry for the ping, but I figured this is a context where it'd be good to have some confirmation as to whether I'm misinforming this poor soul or not)

*** My preference ranking of posts:

1.  Explicitly rational/rationalist fiction
2.  Thoughtful, well-cited discussion posts about rational/rationalist fiction
3.  Rational-adjacent fiction
4.  Other fiction that has strong appeal to [[/r/rational]] for some other reason
5.  Other fiction
6.  Low-effort discussion of rational fiction
7.  Discussion of fiction in general
8.  Discussion of rationality in general
9.  Memes
10. "Hey this reminds me of thing that happened in popular web serial"
11. Other discussion
12. Trolls/spam

Anything at a 5 or below is at risk of being removed, depending partly on community response, attempts to justify it by the OP, and the amount of effort put into it.

In other words, I won't usually nuke a good discussion thread just because the OP should have posted it in one of the weekly threads (seriously, we have a lot of them), or because they put very little effort into their post. But if the thing you're posting is fiction, you should make sure that it's not /just/ sfnal or fantasy fiction, and if you're posting discussion, you should put effort into making a point or adding something of value.

(With regards to 5 in particular, this subreddit has gotten big enough that authors who are looking to self-promote will sometimes come here just because it's got a lot of eyeballs, take one look at the sidebar, and through motivated reasoning just say 'eh, close enough'. We don't actually have the necessary bandwidth to read everything that gets posted to this subreddit though, which is one of the reason that policing on the basis of whether it's rational enough (or [[/r/rational]] enough) is unfeasible, and doesn't /usually/ happen, though there have been one or two flagrant cases.)

** Don't worry people post lots of vaguely rational stuff here. I personaly would prefer if more people posted things that are explicitly rational fiction . But we don't have so much content that people posting less rational stuff is a problem.

*** Have there been many Xianxia recommendations? Is there anything as good as Cradle? Every other Xianxi story I've tried to read ended up having one or both of the two major problems with the genre (that Cradle has avoided so far through my read through, though I am only at book 4), namely: The main characters are irredeemable psychopaths with nonsensical motivations and / or the power differentials in the setting make absolutely no sense whatsoever and the author doesn't even attempt to justify how or why the hordes of weak enemies bother to exist / fight the overwhelmingly powerful god-people.

** My story, The Daily Grind, gets posted here every time I release a chapter. Personally, I'm not entirely convinced that it's 'rational' in the way some people think about it. I'm basically writing my own spin on the style of banter from Buffy The Vampire Slayer along with bizarre reality bending balls of gel light. It doesn't feel like a rational world, even when /sometimes/ the characters take time to utilize their most powerful too; common sense.

I guess what I'm saying is, on the mock "rationality scale", I'd say a 4/10 is enough?

*** Your story (big fan by the way) counts for two reasons, one of which you already mentioned (using common sense and planning). The other is that the characters tend to have genuine, human like reactions, rather than convenient-for-the-plot Hollywood style reactions.

​

I don't think I've stopped anywhere in Daily Grind and thought "well, that was stupid, why didn't character X just do obvious-thing-to-do-Y?" or "what kind of human would react that way given these facts? That makes no sense!"

** Most here will say that if it contains some.of the qualifiers mentioned on the side bar, then it can be posted here. In practice though, this is still Reddit and that means most will shout down anything they disagree with, of you think it's rational and want to share it, then do so, just don't be to surprised when the termites come out of the woodwork and scream about how you are wrong and lust all of the ways how you are wrong. Please don't let that stop you though, as I for one am always open to recommendations.

** Not everything will get universal accolades and might not get recommended later. Some people might even complain about the story. But in the end, you can post almost any content here that remotely tries to be rational and let the community decide from there.

** Does "The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress" count as rational fiction? That was the book that introduced me to the concept of rational anarchy (a political position I have long since whole heartedly adopted) . but I'm not sure if it would be considered "rational" as a whole.
