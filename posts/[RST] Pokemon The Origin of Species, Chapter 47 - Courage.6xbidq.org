** Hey everyone, welcome back! Managed to finish the chapter despite spending half the month teaching at ESPR. Hooray personal goals! It's been a ton of fun, but I'm still in London on my laptop, which means updating anything besides Fanfiction will have to wait. EPUB for patrons and website will be updated when I get home. Enjoy!

*** So, interesting chapter. I liked the speech part at the end. I really like Aiko as a character I like. I am curious about a few things though.

1. They just used a lot of money to get her traveling, over 100,000 worth before the pokedex. I feel this needs to be mentioned, but I dont know what to make of it.

2.This means that of their 24 availible pokemon slots, they are using 5 just for abra's (assuming everyone has a GTFO and Aiko has one to go home and one to come back), 6 if red has a second for bills house.

3.From a tension standpoint, everything is a bit lower now, since they have the ability to sleep in a house with a mini poke center every night, or just pop over for a quick fix. Teleportation is hard to handle in most games and stories, so I'm curious if there is going to be a counter rearing its head soon.

EDIT- Points 2 and 3 are mostly null, 2 because you can have more than six pokemone, (although six on a belt is interesting. I wonder if they keep abra any where in particular.) and 3 because only a single person can use a single abra, bringing total cost up to... 4 abras if you do some pokeball shuffling

1. 100,000?

2. Keep in mind that pokeballs on belts are meant for quick access for battles: "utility" pokemon can be held in backpacks.

3. This is true (except for Blue) but also just part of the "level up" process of a trainer. The more pokemon they get, the more tools and powers they have at their disposal, and teleport is a rather powerful one that gives our heroes an edge if they need one.

Red declared his plan was to sell them "wholesale, at half market price" Abra without a psychic can only remember one place at a time, so round trips wont work, you would need 2 Abras then. 2 abras, at 30k, is 60 k, but that is at half value, so 120k is a decent number, before the pokedex.

******* Well, in the games, an Abra goes for 180 coins in the Celadon Game Corner. Given that the conversion rate is 50 coins for 1000 dollars, that puts a single Abra at 3600 dollars. The Game Corner, like a modern arcade, is probably going to inflate the value of the Abra, so I'd round it down to 3000 dollars a piece. If we take the game price of the Abra as canon, and assume Red sold 30 Abra, his 25,000 dollar profit is about a 73% markdown - what a deal!

**** Can Teleport actually move multiple people at once, we've only ever seen it used for one at a time so far and presumably there is some limit, otherwise we'd have public transport abra where at certain times whole groups of people are teleported between cities.\\
Also how are you getting 100,000? As to the pokedex it was implied to be a refurbished (so probably less valuable) model and Prof. Oak seems to be pretty well off, so can probably afford the occasional expensive gift.

This seemed strange for a second (why wasn't Aiko rushing to to heal her eevee ASAP?), until I realized there isn't really any urgency if eevee is safely suspended in pokeball.

** That last scene is my favorite in the fic so far -- I actually had tears bubbling up. I really like seeing Red as an idealist, like Harry, but gentler and more sensitive. In a different sort of story, I can imagine Red becoming a really interesting public figure: someone who remains bad at these sorts of things (interviews) but is constantly coming up with great ideas that further the public good. I'm imagining this innocent-child-prodigy-savior. It's a really pretty archetype (which might only exist in my head... you'll have to let me know whether it's what you were going for).

I don't think that's where you're taking this though:

- I think it would be hard to pull off since we live in his head, and this is not the main vibe he gives off

- [Redacted private future knowledge]

Still, I think it's worth putting thought into the broader narrative the world has and will have for each of the three (four?), individually and as a team, that will bring you some of the way towards creating an Epic^{1.} You've been showing us how society reacts to the team so far, and how this affects their choices, but this is the first time this has added something to the story for me. It recalls the scenes in Worm where we see Taylor from other perspectives. These scenes are some of my favorites. If you can manage to do the same, I'll be impressed.

One difficulty is that the image stuff (including information about how they are coming across -- not just how they mean to come across^{2)} seems somehow integrated more deeply into your story. This means other-POV interludes or scenes like this one are less powerful, because they are less surprising or demonstrate less growth/change.

Anyway, the team dynamics and the characterization of the trio in that scene are really excellent. It's good to be reminded how well Blue can pull this sort of thing off.

More than ever, I really want Red to do further impressive stuff.

On the hand... I wasn't particularly interested in the rest of the chapter. I was not very engaged with the Aiko plot -- it felt like something we just sort of had to sit through. It seems as though it ought to be possible to present the whole arc there in much fewer words/scenes, but I don't really know. Neither was I particularly interested in the psychic stuff. I'm hoping we don't see too too much more of this particular thing until something cool happens, with training going on in the background until then. The scene with the Eevee felt a bit forced to me. (Partly because she (I think) wasn't part of the normal rotation, partly because /of course/ he's able to help with the pokemon that's the most special. But at least it's sort of economical in that it introduces the Eevee and gives him his /I helped/ moment in one beat.)

Noticed some typos but didn't take notes... sorry! Hopefully others will catch them.

^{1} This also doesn't seem to be what you're going for, unlike, say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line][The Line]], and probably Game of Champions which I haven't read. I think it'd be more fun to read though.

*** Glad you enjoyed it so much <3 You're pretty spot on with Red, I see him as being pulled in the directions of his heroes without being able to quite fill any of their shoes, but rather developing into his own unique person: his journey is shaped by the titans whose shoulders he strode up as he endlessly searched for something even higher.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm trying to plant the seeds of this in his dissatisfaction with the status quo and the people who he admires. Professor Oak and Giovanni are two people he respects above all others, but Red has been happy to take what both have taught him and still find new ways to pursue what he thinks is most important/interesting/useful to others.

#+begin_quote

I love scenes like this as well, I think the closest I've come so far was the one where Giovanni, Misty and Brock discuss the "Young Oak and his companions," but hopefully I can manage to pull more off, despite as you mentioned already tracking these growths from within the characters' perspectives.

Yeah, this chapter definitely bloated on me as I was writing it: it just kept striking me that the problem I'd set up was a hard one, and thus more and more words kept wanting to be written around their struggles while interfacing with it and trying to solve it, and the natural character interactions along the way also felt important. Aiko seems to be a character readers can take or leave, somewhat replacing Leaf in that role :) Maybe someday I'll develop enough to get (almost) everyone on board with every character!

#+end_quote

Got it in one: I was going to have him diagnose a few others too, but it was taking too long so I just cut them and stuck to the discovery with the eevee. Maybe I should add them back in later if I have some time.

** I've said it before and I'll say it again. The obtuse mechanics for the Daycares and all of the civilians that players are unable to battle make it clear to me that you understand the creators' intentions for what the world of Pokémon is meant to be. It isn't about breeding the most powerful creatures for violence, but to make the world a better place for everyone. Sure stories like Falconpain's /Deus Ex Pokeball/ and /Antidote/ give battling an important role in the setting, but you demonstrate in big and small ways that they change every level of society.\\
It makes me feel how intricate bonds between characters can be while making me terrified of major changes like capturing humans in pokeballs, Mewtwo going on a rampage, or the wrong person upsetting a house of cards (Koga's daughter) with the best of intentions. You make us want to hug everyone, believe they can conquer the ends of the earth, and then introduces challenges that make it clear no one will come out unscarred.

Thank you for another terrific chapter! So who wants to talk about the future of that Eevee? Or if anything will come from sending a Pokedex scan of a shiny Eevee to Oak Labs before and after taking it to a Pokémon center?

Huh. There's an idea. "What if the Pokémon center's healing machine causes strange changes in Pokémon that potions, berries, etc. are unable to repair?" That'd be an interesting twist on [[http://pettynuzlockelg.smackjeeves.com/comics/1033352/a-petty-nuzlocke-challenge-new-cover/][Nuzlocke]] stories.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540712/1/Deus-Ex-Pok%C3%A9ball][Deus Ex Pokeball]] is not the happiest short story, but it touches on a lot of commonly-ignored risks of the Pokémon world. The protagonist isn't a trainer, Pokémon are not always good at communicating, and power is never straight forward. It is complete. I think you'd appreciate it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390479/1/No-Antidote][No Antidote]] you'll appreciate just for the recent comments about Doduo and Gyrados' typing. It is, without question, a Tragedy. Some of the ideas about training are as incredible as yours. It shows us the impossible-to-ignore side of adventure in Kanto from the Pokémons' perspective. The final chapters are... controversial, but I think they will make your jaw drop. I'm happy to say that the sad feelings of this story (those felt by the characters) are comparable to how you handled Red. Read it. It may give you ideas about Blue and Giovanni's personalities or body-language-type subtleties in how they'd act.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-special-kind-of-hell-pokemons.4309/][A Special Kind of Hell]] introduced me to the above two stories. It is screwy, it is a little monstrous, and it made me understand why carefully designing a character can have a satisfying payoff. Anyone that plans an atypical Pokémon adventure story should read it for what to avoid and how to pace content/action/lore extremely well. It is more "fanfiction" than it an original story like yours or like the above stuff, but it is worth bookmarking. Maybe it'll help you out of any writer's block.

Edit: I've noticed a distinct lack of conspiracy theories this update about Mewtwo puppetting Aiko or some other teenager in the name of /Friendship!/ Come on commenters, we're slacking.

** It also is going to be interesting how Red's mom reacts to the news conference. The charecters are all written dynamically, anticipating their actions is as engrossing as the story itself, and adds one more layer of my enjoyment.

I do not like Red's Mom as a character, she is actually in the role of an antagonist. I fell her getting angry at Red caused me to be sorrowful, knowing Red's personality. Her being the closest to him, she's seen no reason to doubt his actions (that I know). He is young, which does not free him from consequences. This could easily have been a teaching opportunity to bring them closer in a dangerous world, and also have a better discussion regarding goals, finances, and the role of ethics and morals in building a platform for long term mental stability and happiness. Does anybody else feel similarly or am I misunderstanding something?\\

*** Have you ever heard of a young boy being made the "man of the house" when their father dies? It usually is a little, but important note, in larger events. It adds a bit of background information on why someone interacts one way or another with their mother and siblings. In Red's case his mom fully believing in that idea is a bit loony. But seeing positive growth and strength in him after his father's death?

Seeing him as a potential prodigy of a researcher or trainer?

Imagining him being an incredibly responsible and respectable trainer that involves himself in catastrophes?

All of that is on top of the fact that DaystarEld has raised the competence and maturity of kids in his setting. So Red's mother might hold high standards for him. She may also see him as precious and rather innocent, such that after all of the terrible, spirit-breaking news she has investigated in the past (crimes) that she wants him to avoid getting on peoples' bad sides.

Red will do less-than-legal things (with little regret) if the opportunity is right. I'm not talking about making a rushed decision when lives are on the line. He will shock and disgruntle people while following his heart and standards. In spite of all of his talent and drive his career can take a nosedive if he is blacklisted. His potential will shrivel up if a lucky criminal attacks him with stronger Pokémon. His mother believes in him and believe he has earned such confidence from others, but Red has weak points. Red's /hamartia,/ if he has only one, could make this a painful journey.

I agree that his mother will act as an antagonist multiple times in the future. I also think that Red coming to terms with how other people feel and think about his actions is a completely valid way to direct the story. If we want his mother to spoonfeed him "correct" morality then we would've started the story earlier in the timeline.

**** I do not want to offend, I do want to discuss and learn, so lets sit on the same side of the table and look at this together.

What is his harmartia? I had to look this word up. I don't think this story is written as a tragedy; it is still early. To say Red has a fatal flaw is difficult for me to grasp at this junction(used dictionary to form opinion). I think Blue does, and it almost destroyed him, but he recovered from the fallout through volunteering in the pokecenter, as well as other P.R. activities.\\
You ask several questions in your reply and I think they are rhetorical to get me to see through multiple lenses, thank you. I think that bit of backstory is important to understand the dynamics...in this case I feel that it can explain that Red is his mothers infinitely precious aspect of the physical realm, and that she is allowed to act irrationally. Her reactions still made me dissapointed, and thus dislike her, but I will think on it further to see where I may be wrong. I also have no intent to speak for the authors intent, this analysis is what makes it so enjoyable to read works with depth. Also, its interesting to probe my own thoughts and ask, "Am I projecting?" Furthermore, Aikos father is a foil to Red's mother, and I don't dislike him, I instead empathize. I think there should have been more of a self analysis undertone to Red's Moms thoughts if I was supposed to like her, i.e. she says she raised him better, but she must also realize that people are the product of their enviroment. This begs a nurture vs. Nature aspect, and she is glancing over it. Her methods are not likely to increase his baseline of honesty. Also, this was not a heat of the moment argument, but rather a simmering one, which in my experience is the most dangerous for relationships. Finally, i have to admit a personal bias, Reds mother is a woman, and I have immediately layered her in my expectations of how a woman/mother/female handles emotions, and their role in a relationship. What action could she have done to make me respect her more? She could have spanked Red, and told him he acted childishly and would receive a childs punishment. She could have also given him some money, and told him that she would rather have nothing then have her son lie to her. She could have begun her conversation with an anecdote of her lying to someone she loved.\\
I really want to know Daystar's intent, however isn't it peaking before Christmas? It's still fun to rattle the box a little and imagine whats really inside.

***** I apologize if the tone of my last comment seemed to be aggravating or angry. I really enjoy talking about this and speculating on the future on this story helps the author. You are correct that I was using rhetorical questions to isolate important qualities Red's mother would see Red demonstrate. I was also using them to predict what Red will be doing in the future.

Your sentence about Blue is a terrific example of what I predict Red will do in the future. I really enjoyed reading the conflict and challenges Blue went through for his Shiftry. As Blue justified himself to people that criticized him we, the audience, got a look at the setting history of criminal violence. We learned about the differences between /violence/ and Pokémon battling from the perspective of average citizens. In recent chapters Red talked with Bill and Professor Oak about barriers to scientific progress. Red's focus is on academic research, but he has great passion for the wonders of engineering! He knows that pokeball technology could save lives and Bill made it clear that some morbid topics need to be approached delicately. Bill does not think Red should tell the public about goals to stop anybody from dying.

An important note there, and why I think it connects to Red's future challenges: Bill did not kill Red's conviction. Bill is not the kind of hero Red plans to be. Bill did manage to help Red mature a little bit and protect him from damaging his reputation. [[http://daystareld.com/upset-flowchart/][Red as a logical way of thinking]] which is balanced by powerful emotions such as passion. Bill, Red's Mom, and many other characters help Red improve his thoughts so that he can avoid pitfalls and help him grow. They have an important role in guiding Red as he tries to use his enthusiasm and passion in productive ways.

But. But I brought up Blue, Hamartia, and these positive influences on Red because they are building up to a critical moment. This moment will be a test of Red's character, his competence, and how he values other people. For example: if Red has the opportunity to free Mewtwo followed by a debate on the merits of peace, revenge, etcetera, then should be stand back and allow Mewtwo to eliminate Giovanni's Team Rocket? Mewtwo is a greater threat than the Legendary Birds in this setting. Red knows it is moral to protect humans from dangerous Pokémon. Red may see Mewtwo as a person and cause Mewtwo to allow everyone else in Kanto to live.

That scenario is one of many possible moral quandaries Red could face. Red could make the "right" decision and have people hate or fear him for it. Blue could easily suffer the same thing if he allies himself with Giovanni in some conflict.

I'll readily admit that the conflicts and challenges I see in this story's future could be off-the-mark. Red is a well-written example of a rational character because he does make mistakes. His mother may be an antagonist or she may be an interesting ally. She has her own goals and challenges in the future. I am glad that "like mother, like son" they each sometimes fail to find a perfect solution. I agree that she could have handled that better! Red also made a reasonable decision that hurt someone he cared about. Hahaha! I made this response just to make the points:\\
1) Red is like Blue. Red could be "Dark" without changing his personality.\\
2) Red is like his mother.\\
And yet I brought up so many other points. I love this story. Red isn't the character I identify with most, but every page inspires emotions like nothing else.

****** Reading your reply gave me great joy. There is an underlying danger when speaking about topics of mutual passion, which is that we inadvertently offend in our haste to share. Blame any akwardness on me, so no apology is needed, but your willingness to provide one is kind, and I too return the same. In response: 1) Yes, correct, if you mean evilish? A more ends justifies the means? This is interesting, because if Laura saw this in him as a child, it would explain her response! However this is still bargaining with my already incorrect assertion, i.e. daystars response. As we know, anger is very close to fear. Do you also mean he could turn his psychic abilities off? Perhaps its not either-or here, perhaps him doing so would cause him to lack empathy. Perhaps this is further explanation of Blues mental mindset. Red is like his mother: This is a broad statement, and I do agree with it; being generous to say red is inquisitive, brave, cognizant, and has a self defined moral framework that alligns with what is a majority would percieve as positive. Red is also unlike his mother - he has less personal experiences as to how the world works. He is likely more educated in the realm of physical laws. He has selfless expectations of people - he is considerate of oaks time and value, while cautiously using their relationship for mutual gain, and even then hesitantly. He has greater psychic ability. He is more isolated from the cruelty of the world at this time. You did bring up many points, and you are demonstrating a great deal of understanding. Furthermore, not sure if you saw but daystar commented to verify your interpretation of his mom, earlier. I really can't say much more other then it was certainly nice to get a greater understanding of the characters through you. I hope we can speak more in the further, and if you care to recommend any writing to me I would be thankful, and I would be happy to recipricate if the need arises.

However, he specifically promised his mother that he would not do it, in order to secure her cooperation, and then broke his promise. Dishonesty matters, and the fact that she became involved in something that she would not approve of, under false pretences, also matters.

I don't agree with Red's justification here. He had good reasons for needing the money, but not for lying. He could have borrowed from her - or from Professor Oak, probably - and used the Abra income to quickly repay it. He could have sold his Clefairy at cost price, which would not have violated the spirit of their agreement or her conscience. He could probably have delayed his research by a few weeks if really needed. He could have called her, explained his reasons, and asked permission, or for early access to his other funds - or at least forgiveness.

Instead he broke his promise, and then kept quiet. Naturally she feels betrayed and angry; how can she trust his promises in future?

I analyze because there's more then just a surface story here, and while I may pay too much attention to something unimportant, it allows me to catch some gems as well. You are still providing realistic stimuli that could present challenges to your creations, and I hope not everything is perfect and obvious and intended, as then I couldn't think further on it.
