Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** It's been a while, because I kept trying to make a big monday post. This might end up that way, but I figured it's more important to give out recommendations than it is to give out a lot of them. Standard disclaimer: none of these are necessarily rational, but most of them are intelligent or otherwise suited to this community.

*WORM:*

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/daystar-worm-exalted-crossover-au.773104/][/Daystar/]] is a Worm/Exalted crossover. Just saying that is a blast from the past, but it's a relatively recent story. It starts pretty interesting, but I feel like the last arc has lost a lot of momentum. I'm still not sure where it's trying to go. It also has a budding Taylor/Sophia relationship, and that ship can burn in hell where it belongs. Nevertheless, it's got okay grammar, and it's over the 30k word hump, so it beats like 75% of /Worm/ fanfiction. What I like more is...

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pyrrhic-victory-rwby-worm.775690/][/Pyrrhic Victory/]], a RWBY crossover where Pyrrha Nikos is inserted into the body of Emma Barnes after Pyrrha dies in season 3, a year or so before /Worm/ canon. This story really delivers on the feeling of impostor syndrome that such a situation would create, but it's still not out of its second arc. Still, at 49k words, I feel like it has a little while to go before it dies. I'm really loving its direction.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au.680881/][/Trailblazer/]] is a great Gundam alt-power/fusion. I feel like I read it and dropped it before, but I must be imagining things, because when I went through it recently it felt like one of the best /Worm/ stories I've ever read. It really nails the dissonance between Taylor's perspective and how the rest of the world views her - her costume has a /dramatic cape/, but she has no idea that she comes across as authoritative and put-together. It's nearly at 350k words and updates regularly. If I had a complaint, it's that the AU elements from Gundam could have been introduced more smoothly.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tank-worm-altpowertaylor-au-complete.700525/][/Tank/]] (complete) is a piece of /Worm/ crack fiction where Taylor has the power to turn into an endless army of Soviet tanks. Roon is probably the only person in the fandom that could have written it, because the story parodies two things simultaneously, in brutally hilarious fashion. The first is the explicit parody of USSR-brand communism. The second is the meta-commentary about stories which try to portray /Worm/'s neo-nazi faction as sympathetic - she's trying to tell the brain-dead idiots on Spacebattles that those stories are exactly as absurd as Tankie!Taylor is. It's amazing and I love it.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mauling-snarks-worm.41471/][/Mauling Snarks/]] is actual trash. I've read one hundred and fifty chapters of it, mostly because I ran out of actually good Worm fanfiction, and I can say without a doubt that it's the blandest wormfic I've ever read. Everyone has the same voice, there is no villain beyond redemption, and /nothing ever happens/. Even when you think it's going to dip into fanon and offend you, the consequences are so minimal it's hard to muster the energy. /Why/ have I read 150 chapters then? Because there are elements of it that are fascinating. There's this dissonance between how the author has written/views the main character and how the character actually looks when you zoom out on their behavior. After reading most of the story, I can really buy that this character is Jack Slash's niece: the weird emotionless tone of the narrative fits with a sociopath who only gets entertainment from fucking with people, and Taylor's bizarre willingness to cross boundaries as if they never even existed fits how I would imagine a Slaughterhouse 9 member. I don't recommend you read this story, but if you feel like those things above would give you enough value, it will do in a pinch. Updates regularly, and has a huge backlog of chapters.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/still-defiant-worm-defiant-peggy-sue.789799/][/Still Defiant/]] is a brand new story, at three chapters long. Normally I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend something that early, but this story has the distinction of making the most succinct and accurate assessment of a peggy-sue scenario I've ever seen. This story is the closest to classically rational on this whole list. Quote:

#+begin_quote
  There's a remote possibility that this is a simulation of some sort, but that sort of worry is something completely unaddressable. I'll act as if this is real, and if it isn't then I'll either never learn otherwise, or discover the truth and adjust accordingly.

  In much the same way, my memories of ‘the future' could merely have been a sort of one-time precognitive vision. But, I'll never be able to know the difference. Better to take them at face value - doubting myself in such a way could only be a hindrance.

*NARUTO:*

- About once every two months, I return to Naruto fanfiction to scope out what people in the fandom seem to think is the best of the best. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][/Sanitize/]] is one of the stories that justifies coming back. I found it in the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/bn5cec/the_gold_standard_of_naruto_fanfiction_20page/][Gold Standard Recommendation List]] - I can vouch for about half of the stories in there. This one is among the better ones. SI with a basic recollection of modern medical technology gets inserted into the Warring Clans era and runs her own clinic, quickly turning it into neutral territory. I really love how down-to-earth this story is, compared to the frenetic action of ninja. Slow updates.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12566900/chapters/28622888][/Retrograde Motion/]] is a Sakura peggy-sue story, also from the Gold Standard list. If I'm being honest it's kind of trash, but it isn't terribly written, and when you acknowledge all of the AU elements for what they are it can be entertaining. A good time-waster, and a novel experience if you haven't read Naruto fanfiction in a while. Sloooow updates.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17401478/chapters/40958717][/What You Knead/]] was published early this January, so I'm a little late to the party. As a short story, it's pretty easy to miss, but even at its current length it more than meets my minimum standards for a good fic. Kakashi decides to become a baker as a hobby, and it helps him work through a lot of his trauma better than his usual coping mechanisms. It's actually remarkably similar to /Loaf/ from the /Worm/ fandom - another recommendation for that, if you haven't read it. Definitely a feel-good story. In progress/On hiatus, but it's slice of life, so it could sit as it is forever and still be worth reading.

*MISC:*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes][/Walk Two Lifetimes/]] is a Bleach SI fic, set from the perspective of someone with "vague knowledge of two arcs of Bleach" who is reincarnated into Hisana Kuchiki. I put "vague knowledge" in airquotes because the author /really/ overestimated what knowledge that would be. Nevertheless, it's emotionally compelling in a way only the best SI stories could be. It ends on a cliffhanger, and it's not due for another update for six or so months, but if you're okay with a little bit of sadness it's a must-read.

- [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/theatrum-alchemicum-technical-waifu-simulator-tournament.8063/][/Theatrum Alchemicum/]] is a NSFW quest on Questionable Questing that misled me into thinking it was actually NSFW. There's a lot of risque fanservice moments, but currently no actual sex scenes as of when I caught up. Instead, there is a lot of interesting worldbuilding going into creating the context for the "waifu tournament" that the main character takes part in. I'm really happy with how this quest is going, and how the quest-maker is rewarding the players for making risky plays instead of punishing them. Like a Royal Road story, only competent. Updates frequently.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/united-we-stand-halo-mass-effect-crossover.736864/][/United We Stand/]] is your typical Mass Effect crossover where humanity is swapped out with the the UNSC and UEG from Halo. It, in true Spacebattles fashion, spends way to long on individual battles and goes into way to much detail about the military capabilities of all of the participants. But where it stops being typical is in how it treats each of the different parties. Instead of reading like an [[/r/HFY]] manifesto, /United We Stand/ allows the Citadel Council the be both realistic and altruistic in how it acts: not as an adversary, but as an ally against a much greater threat. And even the Covenant are given their fair shake - for a genocidal alien race, anyway. They may not be sympathetic, but you /can/ understand how and why they operate, even if the reason is fucking stupid. This novelty alone is a good enough reason to push through all of the battles, for me. I can't wait for the next updates. Recently revived, but has been written entirely within the span of this year.

As always, don't count on these being great to read for you. But they all get my seal of approval for being tolerable enough to catch up on. I'm up-to-date on the latest chapter for most of these, and the ones I'm not up-to-date on I'm waiting to binge through. I can guarantee that the grammar in each is well above par for fanfiction, and I can also guarantee that none of them have done things that would have made me drop them.

**** She's a sidekick, so far. But she takes a smaller role in the plot after the early chapters. I figured a lot of her completeness can be attributed to Veda being a complete blueprint from the Gundam universe, and the general tendency of tinker creations to work with minimal resources. I can't say she'll be unimportant forever, but she doesn't trivialize every encounter or something like that.

EDIT: Also, Worm isn't that realistic about AI in the first place, so it's not necessarily out of line for the setting.

**** The Gold Standard of Worm fanfiction looks something like this.

Longfics:

- /A Cloudy Path/ probably gets the Original Flavor award for being pretty similar up until maybe the last five arcs.
- /Split/ is devastating and wonderfully written. Best version of a Trump power.
- /Mixed Feelings/ is cute but has a lot of padding.
- /Trailblazer/ really captures the good parts of mech anime and everything else doesn't suck.
- /A Subtle Knife/ is the best crossover set in a different universe.
- /El-Ahrairah/ gets the specifics of Worm's shardlore wrong, but it does the best I've seen in any fanfiction.

Smaller fics:

- /Deputy/ is the best unpowered Taylor, but it would be beaten by /Denial/ if that hadn't died.
- /Camera Shy/ is the best cluster!Taylor. Out of maybe three or four fics, sure, but it's still good.
- /Aspects/, for nailing Wildbow's style instead of just Worm's style.
- A ton more alt!powers and stuff under 100k words, many of which I don't have time to sort through.

And finally, specific authors:

- Anything by UnwelcomeStorm for character interaction driven stories, but especially /Constellations/.
- maroon_sweater for crackfics, and I'll stand by that until roon finishes something that /isnt/ a crackfic. Maybe Loaf counts.
- Harbin is a good writer with a lot of dead stories.
- ManMagnficent for good characterization (usually)
- RavensDagger, but only read until the jokes start getting old.
- Any authors that are popular in other fandoms and have branched out into Worm, like Ryuugi.
- And pretty much anything else by an author on this list.

** The topic today is retro fantasy.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92121.Nine_Princes_in_Amber][Nine Princes in Amber]] by Roger Zelazny. Zelazny was known more for sci-fi than fantasy, but this fantasy series moves quickly and paints in broad strokes. The premise would be a bit of a spoiler for the first book, but its ontological implications might be of interest to those on the sub.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152328.One_for_the_Morning_Glory][One for the Morning Glory]] by John Barnes. Could be considered a predecessor to Practical Guide in that it's about characters aware they're taking part in stories. Has some amazing lines. You should take this book very seriously and not at all seriously, just as it takes itself. The opening execution sequence alone is worth the price of admission.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18116.His_Dark_Materials][His Dark Materials]] by Philip Pullman. /What if souls were empirically real?/ This question has a huge number of epistemic, ontological, theological, ethical, and practical concerns, and Pullman pokes into an impressive number of them.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642.A_Wizard_of_Earthsea][A Wizard of Earthsea]] by Ursula K. Le Guin. This book is incredibly spare in conception and prose. Rewarding reading.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104089.Tigana][Tigana]] by Guy Gavriel Kay. What if the name of a land were stolen from its people? Kay is one of the better writers in fantasy, and this is one of his better books.

*** Nine Princes in Amber &al: a lot of fun. First five books are better than the second five. Don't read if you care about minor continuity errors. Stay away from the Betancourt prequels.

His Dark Materials: Excellent first two books. Third book... has problems. The downer part of the ending is contrived (though I'll forgive that if the sequel trilogy it sets up is any good); the victory over the (arguable) primary antagonist is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, and, well, there's some implied creepy stuff going on given the ages of the protagonists.

A Wizard of Earthsea: I really need to re-read this. If you liked the bits of HPMOR about seals that shouldn't be opened, there's a lot of people opening those seals and having to deal with them.

Tigana: All I can say about this book is that, after reading his debut trilogy, I was emphatic about not reading any other GGK novels. I was assigned this book as part of a college course, and it completely reversed my opinion of the author (though not of /The Fionavar Tapestry/), and I went on to read most of what he's written since then. It's /that/ good.

I haven't read One for the Morning Glory.

****** Fair, but from a materialist deterministic viewpoint, free will simply doesn't exist and pretty much everything is preordained from the start anyway. What you're pointing out is the fundamental problem of free will - an issue that exists within all narratives that include prophecies and future-past feedback loops. If such things really were possible, well, we'd have to deal with a lot of situations in which we both would have the impression of having made a free choice yet the outcome was effectively determined from the start. Or from a different point of view - is it any more moral, or any less existentially terrifying, that Harry Potter might have been forced to kill Voldemort by prophecy, than Lyra and Will just making love, without being prompted or pushed, simply following what at the time was a genuine impulse they felt, even though it was also prophesied to happen?.

*** Seconding /Nine Princes/ (Corwyn cycle only).

It has some of the best character development in fantasy I've read. The titular nine princes do a lot of growing up over the course of the series, despite their ages. All the clever power plays that are the heart of the early books seem incredibly immature in retrospect.

It also has the best take on ye olde amnesia plot I've seen anywhere. Too often, a shallow blank-slate protagonist slowly discovers a past self that's essentially a complete stranger. But here the protagonist clearly /is/ their past self, a complete character with all the depth of personality and experience - only missing the memories. That makes the mystery so much more tantalising.

** I've finished Luminosity now and Radiance, the sequel. Someone warned me the sequel was terrible and was a marked drop in quality but I honestly noticed no difference - Radiance has a new viewpoint character who I didn't like as much but I still liked fine, and the plot was a lot more complicated (I lost track of a few characters and was scrunching my face up going "who is Jane, again?"), but it was still an incredible story. I'm working my way through the short story collections now.

If anyone was scared off by the thought of (mild spoiler about the nature of the endings (e.g. happy vs sad, satisfying vs unsatisfying)) Luminosity having a sad ending and Radiance being no good , rest assured that Radiance reads great and has a satisfying ending, and even has a collection of assorted shorts/flashes that do prologue and epilogue stuff in very cool ways

Whole-hearted recommendation, though I was hoping more romance from a Twilight fan-fic. The series didn't really deal with romance in what I'd consider a rational way: the romance was a lot of the time supernaturally "forced", so relationship issues didn't feature into the story. That said, it was good to see a rational work that didn't completely ignore romance. But my quest continues.

** I saw this recommended here some time ago and wanted to echo the rec.

[[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/][Release That Witch]] is an uplift isekai. A mechanical engineer wakes up one day in the body of a loser prince in a Medieval setting, only to discover that the witches being hunted by the church actually have magic powers. He attracts them to his banner and uses them to industrialize the region, eventually wielding modern processes and tech against knights, the church, and other supernatural forces in the world.

I felt it did a great job not just uplifting, but in explaining the mechanics behind various technologies and how they might be used in a low-tech setting. It /does/ trend to the power fantasy side of things, but all in all tends to at least ensure that the MC has to pay for each resounding victory with a slog of R&D failures first.

And I dunno man. There's just something viscerally /satisfying/ about watching snooty knights and nobles get roflstomped with heavy artillery.

This is a Chinese translation and suffers from middling grammar, odd phrasing, bad formatting, and strange punctuation, as well as occasional chapter order mess ups. If you can overlook all that, tho, it's a satisfying piece of work.

Oh, also no harem, minimal romantic bullshit.

**** Joel Rosenberg's Guardians of the Flame series has some of this element. The later books of the series get more into it. A handful of college students get transported to their D&D world. One of the PCs (not the protagonist) was studying civil engineering and gets rail and gunpowder going.

There are novels like Lord of the Mysteries that do like Worth the Candle and feature a protagonist isekai into a world several hundred years past the arrival of a previous industrializing isekai.

** I'm not sure I'm still allowed to post here since it's over midnight here, but I find surprising I don't see [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/49865/Ajin][Ajin]] (The Manga) being recommended here more often. It is probably the most rational manga I've seen in a while. Most certainly the most rational very popular one.

There's some straw vulcanism, arguably, but most of the actions of the main character make very much sense. And the immortality is absolutely munchkined to hell. The main character is rational, or at least very close to rational, the powers are consistent at all times, the villain is charismatic and pretty much every character is realistic even when they are not rational themselves.

*** Loosely speaking, the [[https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/my-hero-academia-vigilantes][vigilantes spinoff]] is more rational than the base series. Its power level is lower than the regular version, and concurrently it's somewhat more "thinky", with the important battles (and even some of the less important, played-for-laughs ones) have a greater focus on well considered use of more limited powers. Lest I give you the wrong idea, it's not munchkiny, though.

****** To each their own. People discovering "new dimensions" to their quirk or "unlocking" new abilities for it reeks of the deus ex machina shounen BS that i thought BnHA was trying to avoid. It's worth noting that in the main series, that whole bit about being able to do so only really started being a thing after the protagonist got their own deus ex machina upgrade. The only one I really liked was Twice's, because his was rooted in actual deep psychological trauma that was clear from his character introduction, not "oh yeah i spanked u as a child until u stopped floating around, guess u forgot lol"

Hikkigaya isn't a rational character, but he nevertheless has many traits similar to one, making him enjoyable to read. His ability is to copy up to 108 quirks and use any one of them at a time at 108th the strength of the original quirk. There is munchkinry.

** Not exactly "rational", but what is the book that has the most realistic portrayal of the effects magic (or some other weird thing) would have on society? Bonus points if the author actually has a background in economy/sociology. Extra bonus points if it either modern times (harder to explain technology), or at least tries to explain why society hasn't evolved technologically for thousands of years.

#+begin_quote
  Gwen Song awoke in a new world where all that she was familiar with had disappeared and she must begin from zero. A 21st-century tale of an Earth ruled instead by magic, where humanity lives in enclaves shielded from magical beasts and otherworldly beings. Follow Gwen as she struggles to once again rebuild her life in the new world, a tale of companionship, adventure, and Spellcraft! Grow with Gwen as she grows from high school to university, and finally onto the real world, discovering the secrets of a real-life world made unreal by magic and Mages.

  Inspired by the spell system of classic Dungeon and Dragons, but set in the Modern World.

It does deal with economy ad society (in her previous life the MC was an economist/business owner), but it's not exactly "deep." Plus the way the author writes is a bit odd, slightly jarring but not terrible.

It also deals with politics (to an extent), a society that had to build up a country around mages (the "Tower system") and the MC travels to different countries with their own distinct culture, government, mythology, etc.
