Do you mean Lovecraftian horror?

Or did George Orwell write some really awesome cosmic horror stories that I haven't heard of yet and really, /really/ need to read?

** Our top priority is to get him on our side, and to get him reasonably willing to do things other than beat up criminals for justice.

Alan Scott appears to have an uncommon name in our era, Alan less so. Alan, celtic word meaning harmony, stone, noble. Scott, celtish name, painted warrior.

Is he Irish? Or Scottish? Regardless, I wouldn't expect him to be common in morality with the average civilian.

He has super powers. He seems to use green powered slams. Does he have ranged power? Is he vulnerable to guns, unlike superman? He seems to not have omniscience, given the surprise.

So, to aid him, we could produce body armor for him, we could provider a spotter to call out dangerous threats (kid green lantern), we could subvert police scanners and hire private investigators to find whatever he wants to beat up, we could hire mercenaries and a private security army to aid him in his missions (even if he's invulnerable more people could make sure his enemies can't flee, increase his reach) and provide him with specialized ranged weapons. We can convince the police and government to support his crusades. Our spotter or spotters can help protect whatever empowers them. If they're human, perhaps that ring?

We can determine how to best aid him based off our conversation, where we should be polite, friendly, interesting, and seek to adopt any minimally invasive morals they propose- if they think some random gang are scum of the earth, that's fine, we can believe that too. We should advance our own moral desires- improve gotham, protect the people, stop crime, and try to align them with his.

In terms of aiding us, I can see a number of possibilities.

Can he phase into humans? He may be able to accurately scan or assess the placement of organs and blood vessels of humans in a way that would advance surgery substantially.

Do we have rich and powerful opponents who don't support Gotham's crime going down? He can scan private safes and gather documents that would let us take them down.

Does this magical power of his have any scientific knowledge? Any databases of how to do things better? It'd be good to ask him what it knows and to see if it can create advanced devices we could copy, or put him in a room with our scientists to experiment with his powers.

Can he reproduce his powers? A dozen like him would be a lot more effective, chosen according to whatever reasonable values he advanced.

Obviously, don't think or do anything to betray him, unless he starts being wildly immoral. He may have mind reading powers, and he's a valuable ally.
