Pyrebound is a hard high-fantasy serial that's been going for ... crikey, two years now. I plan to finish in ten more updates, but that's what I thought five updates ago so don't believe me, I'm full of crap. Anyway, the world is modeled somewhat after the ancient near east, and I delve heavily into the nitty-gritty of worldbuilding in terms of the effects magic and magical disasters would have on economics, politics, culture, and what-have-you. If this is new to you and sounds interesting, the first update is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][right here]]. Thank you!
