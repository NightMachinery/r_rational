  13. All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.

Basically, leaving bodies at the bottom of a cliff unattended is actually such a common silly thing it was an actual listed cliche by or before 96-97.

I would think that would apply even more to creatures as full of bullshit immunities to death and highly specific weaknesses as a vampire.

That said, allowing vampires to die and come back fairly regularly could be part of a overall rational strategy for dealing with vampires as in e.g. Terry Pratchett's Carpe Jugulum, which posits a fairly interesting reasoning behind why vampires act as they do in a world with the specific weaknesses and strengths they have.
