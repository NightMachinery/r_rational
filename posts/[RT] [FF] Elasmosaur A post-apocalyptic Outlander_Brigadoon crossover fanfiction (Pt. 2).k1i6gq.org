When Moira came to, it was to a lovely female voice singing in English---

/“Sing me a song of a lass that is gone/

/Say, could that lass be I?/

/Merry of soul she sailed on a day/

/Over the sea to Skye...”/

Moira opened her eyes a crack---not enough to be perceptible to anyone watching her, but enough to see a woman standing in the slanted light from a window, grinding something in a mortar.

“You're no' from around here,” Moira croaked.

The woman looked up sharply. “You're awake!”

She had an old-fashioned English accent, 20th or 21st century, if Moira had to guess.

“That song,” Moira said, “Those lyrics are from the 1800s. Late 1800s, I think.”

The woman came over and lifted Moira's wrist, taking her pulse. “You're a good deal sharper than the knife that fellow put in your shoulder, more's the pity,” the woman said. “If it had been a good clean cut, I could've saved you what's going to be quite a nasty scar.”

Moira smirked. “My husband likes scars,” she said, “Gets him real---”

She suddenly sat bolt upright, staring at the window. “Wha' time is it?”

The woman stepped back hurriedly. “About three in the afternoon.”

“I have tae get oot of here,” Moira said, swinging her legs off the pallet she'd been lying on. A hot, stabbing pain shot up from her thigh, and she gasped, remembering the gunshot.

“I can appreciate the sentiment,” the other woman said, “but you're in no condition to be going anywhere right now.”

Moira glared at her. “Two years ago I was on a scouting party in the ruins of Edinburgh,” she said, “My nineteenth birthday. Got ambushed by the biggest tiger I've ever seen. Put a fleschette intae him, but before the neurotoxin could take effect, he chomped doon on my other leg there.” She gestured helpfully to her left shin, in case this woman was fuzzy on the locations of appendages. “Cracked my tibia wi' one big tooth an' fully severed the calf muscle. I crawled three kilometers back to the rendezvous point wi' a tourniquet keepin' My blood inside.” She stood up. “An' I was four months pregnant. I'll make it through this, too.”

The woman's eyebrows arched. “You got ambushed by a tiger...in the ruins of Edinburgh?”

Moira nodded and grabbed a broom from the wall, testing its efficacy as a makeshift crutch.

“Why...why was there a tiger in Edinburg, and why is it in ruins? Another Blitzkrieg?”

Moira limped back and forth a few paces, then examined the end of the too-long broom handle critically. “Pox. Killed damn near the whole world since you've been gone. You're from what---1947? 2047?”

“Nineteen forty-six,” the woman answered. “But then, I have been here for more than a year...” she sighed. “I'm Claire. Claire...oh, hell. I've got too many surnames to keep track of at this point.”

“Moira Frasier,” Moira returned. “Wait---you've been in Briga Na Dun for over a year?”

“No, no, I arrived /here/ five days ago. I was looking for the stone circle just outside of town---Craigh Na Dun, for which the town is named, I think. I wanted to try to travel back...back home. To the future.” She hung her head. “Or...the past, now. I'm afraid I've made rather a mess of things. It's what...2147 now?”

“Yep,” Moira said. “Wait, you're from 1947...but that means you would ha' arrived day before yesterday, not 5 days ago.”

“I arrived in the 18th century over a year ago,” Claire said, “In 1746. Somehow I traveled through time from my own year. I had hoped to jump straight back to 1946---or ‘47, at the very least---but when I evoked whatever it is that drives Craigh Na Dun, nothing happened. The next day, there was a lovely couple from 1847 out on a picnic who were quite surprised to find a town here...and even more surprised when that maniac Lundy declared the woman a witch and they were killed trying to escape.”

Moira's head snapped up. “What?”

Claire nodded gravely. “Not big on witches here. Which is bad news for the English woman who accidentally trapped the entire town in a time vortex with pagan magic. /And/ for the girl with the pagan tattoo on the back of her head who masqueraded as a man and killed or maimed some of the most respected misogynists in the village, I shouldn't wonder.”

Moira groaned. “Those bastards. Why could they no' ha' left well enough alone? What's happened tae Fiona and Brian?”

“Safe, if under suspicion. Fiona's with her sister and brother-in-law, who are genuinely nice folks. Brian...I believe he's making the case that burning us would be a waste of good firewood.”

Moira's eyes went wide. “We need tae get oot o' here.”

She hobbled toward the door, but just as she passed the partition behind which her pallet had been sitting, she yelped in terror and crashed to the ground, her leg failing to support her as she dove away from the thing in the bed next to hers. “Shamber!” she yelled.

Claire rushed over to help her up. “What?”

“That's a shambler,” Moira said, pointing a trembling finger at the pustule-covered humanoid form in the bed.

Claire raised an eyebrow. “He's just got smallpox. What's a shambler?”

Moira stared at her, wild-eyed. “They're the reason Edinburgh's a ruin. They have the Pox! No' your silly smallpox, /the/ Pox! Big Pox, I guess!”

Claire looked utterly confused “Syphilis?”

“No! What? No. Neither of those. The Pox that killed the world! How long has he been like that?”

“What are you carrying on about?” the man asked in Gaelic, just as Claire said, “Ten days, I think he'll pull through.”

“He...he can still talk? After /ten days?”/ Moira asked, astonished. “People with the Pox dinna keep talking that long, they go mad! Start attackin' people after just a few hours!”

Claire was watching her placatingly. “Moira, it's /not/ the same disease. Now that you mention it, though...one of the Murray boys came in this morning with aggressive delirium and smallpox symptoms. His brother said they'd fought off a man who leaked pus all over them, and Jock took ill almost immediately. He's restrained in the other room.”

Moira turned sharply toward her. “He's the one they need tae burn,” she said, “Not us. What about the other brother?”

“He's fine. Had the smallpox two years ago, so he wasn't worried about catching it.”

“But it's no' the same disease! He got the pus on him!”

Claire snorted. “So did I, and several others. The village is having a smallpox outbreak right now...awful business. I told them about the cow pox technique, but they don't believe me. Not particularly educated out here, even Lundy, the so-called schoolmaster. They told me if I was such a great healer, I should be in with the sick, so they locked me in here with those who are symptomatic.”

Moira was staring at her in horror. “You got the pus from a shambler on you?”

“Jock? Yes. Bit of an occupational hazard in here.”

“When?”

“Oh, about...ten this morning. I sedated him and he's been out since.” She suddenly looked in surprise at Moira. “Have you not had your jab? For smallpox? The vaccine?”

Moira rolled her eyes. “Your little pox has been gone for nearly 200 years, why would I have gotten a jab for it? That's /not/ the point---the point is, how could you have been exposed over five hours ago and no' even started tae show symptoms?”

Claire shrugged uncertainly. “I've...had my jab? They gave it to all the nurses in the war. But...look, for /smallpox,/ the incubation period is weeks. You're telling me this Pox of yours incubates in less than five hours?”

“Less than one,” Moira said grimly. “But...hold on...the Pox /came/ from here. It was made from smallpox that someone contracted from this village in 2047 before spreading it...” She lapsed into silence for a long moment. “you're telling me that people who've had smallpox---or gotten the vaccine for it---have been in contact wi' pus from a Shambler and no' turned?”

Claire nodded slowly.

Moira turned back to the pustule-ridden man in the bed, who was staring at her in consternation. “Claire...what is the fastest way for me tae get that disease?”

Five minutes later, Moira was rubbing puss into the cut on her arm that the gentleman by the gate had so thoughtfully given her. “I want to protest once more,” Claire said, “This seems most unhygienic.”

“That's the idea,” Moira said, tucking several small vials of the pus that they'd lanced from volunteers in one of her pockets. “Now, we need tae get through that door. Gah, what I wouldna' give frae a wee bit of plastic explosive...”

Claire gestured at the door. “That lock? I picked it yesterday. I just...didn't know where I'd go...”

A slow smile lit up Moira's face. “Claire...I could kiss you. Ach, sorry, you're from the olden days, aren't you? Squeamish aboot that sort of thing, I shouldna' wonder. I'd have my husband kiss you, then.”

Claire stared.

“Right. Not better,” Moira muttered, “Let's just go.”

As Moira and Claire emerged into the evening sun, they were greeted by the unwelcome sight of a man standing just outside, evidently assigned to guard the door. He drew his saber and advanced on Moira, who eight seconds and some rather ingenious use of a broom later, was now in possession of a rather fine saber.

“One second” Moira said, and hobbled up the street to Fiona's house, from whence Moira and Brian had heard Claire's singing earlier that day. To her surprise, Brian opened the door at the banging of her saber pommel. “Moira!” he said in surprise, “How did you get out?”

“Witchcraft,” Moira said, “Is Fiona in? We need tae /go./ Now!”

“I'm here,” came Fiona's voice from behind him, and the man and woman Moira had caught sight of just before she lost consciousness earlier that day accompanied Fiona and Brian out into the road. “They want to burn you,” Brian said, “Charles and I were just trying to figure out a way to rescue you!”

“It's the thought that counts,” Moira said, “But we're rescued. Let's go.”

“Go where?” apparently-Charles said, “Lundie's band willna' stop hunting us until near midnight, and wi' that wound on thy leg, we canna ootrun them fra' long.”

“Crag Na Dun,” Claire said suddenly. “We may not be able to cover more distance than them, but I think I can take us somewhere else if we can get there.”

“Where's my gun?” Moira asked. Brian ducked back inside and brought it out, along with their packs. Moira checked the gauge and pulled a second magazine out of an exterior pouch on her bag.

Brian helped Fiona's sister shoulder Moira's pack while Charles and Fiona got under Moira's shoulders. They had barely made it to the front gate when a cry of alarm sounded behind them. They bolted through, and Moira shrugged away from her helpers to aim her gun through a chink in the stone wall. Three hissing cracks sounded, and three of their pursuers, armed with claymores and muskets, fell almost instantly to the ground. A musket ball exploded into the stone just to the left of Moira's head, but she didn't even flinch as she dropped the shooter with another poison fleschette. “How far to the cairn?” she asked.

“It's just around the corner of the wall, to the west,” Claire replied.

Moira felled two more wavering highlanders before pulling away from the niche she had been occupying and once more accepting Charles' and Fiona's assistance toward the indicated location.

It wasn't long before the mob regained its courage and an ominous thrumming zip announced the passage of a musket ball over their heads just before the thunderous report caught up with it. Moira spun and dropped to one knee, firing five more shots, three of which found their targets. A copse of trees offered some shelter from their pursuers' sight lines, and once out the other side Moira could see a ring of standing stones that Claire had already reached.

“When are we going?”

“As soon as possible,” Brian said at the same time Moira said, “Tomorrow!” interpreting it as a question of destination rather than departure.

“I need a gemstone,” Claire said, “I think that's what went wrong last time!”

“Here!” Fiona's sister removed and tossed her a wedding band, which Claire caught. “Everyone in the circle,” she said, just as a gunshot took a chunk out of one of the stones.

Moira darted around behind one of the monoliths and returned fire, trying to keep her hands steady through the trembling engendered by her throbbing leg.

Mr. Lundy was standing at the edge of the copse of trees they'd fled through, surrounded by half a dozen or so remaining men who would brave Moira's deadly aim at the school teacher's exhortations.

“Suffer not the witches to live!” he screamed, “If they leave, the blessing of God shall be lifted and unworthy interlopers shall find our town once---”

Moira squeezed the trigger, but never saw if her shot found its mark in Lundy's throat. The world suddenly went black, and she half-believed she'd been shot or otherwise blinded before her eyes adjusted to the darkness of night. The stone she was leaning against was still in place, but the town and even the copse of trees had completely vanished.

There was silence for a surprisingly long time, other than the trill of crickets and the heavy breathing of the five escapees.

“I warned you,” Moira said after a while, “Cult town.”

“Well, shit,” Brian said, “I was really looking forward to /not/ living in a plague-ravaged hellscape.”

Moira limped over to where Fiona's sister was sitting wrapped in her husband's arms and awkwardly dug into the pack the woman was wearing. She checked the date and time on her satellite terminal---apparently Claire had managed to jump them just over a week and a half, rather than the day Moira had suggested.

“You might just get your wish,” Moira said. “I think we're about tae see the first time in history people are /happy/ an American's spreading smallpox. I've got vials of it---wi' any luck, I'm incubating some in me right now. It's an innoculant against the shamblers.”

Brian stared at her, his pale face emerging from the darkness as her eyes adjusted to the light. “You mean...we can end the Pox?”

“Keep it from ending us, anyway,” she said. She hadn't spent the scrip to make a high-band sat call home on this trip, but with almost a week since she was supposed to have been home, felt it was about time. She punched in her husband's voice address.

“Still,” Brian mused, would've been nice to ride the past into the future, as it were.”

“Suit yourself,” Moira said, pressing /call/, “I like the present.”
