** Okay, stream of consciousness thoughts on the chapter and the interlude:

​

1.  Quality chapter. Not my favorite so far, but good.

2.  The dolphin thing ... well, it's logical that this would happen to someone eventually, and it was handled well, but it's weird for me to think about.

3.  Wait, the Animorphs don't seem to know that David was a traitor, but they aren't trying to bring him back with a cancer patient... did no one left alive from before have his morph? Has anyone checked through his mind lately if they had it?

4.  I like all the layers to Tobias's psychology in this chapter: his competing motivations, his attempts to get past all the whispers of habit/fear/desire tugging him in different directions, only to realize later with Temrash in his head that there was an entire set of reckless and suicidal motivations still in his blindspot. By the end of the chapter, he's made the choice to be a controller. I wonder how the other Animorphs will feel about this.

5.  Okay, so here's the part that makes the least sense to me: when Tobias wrenches back control from Temrash, I can't figure out the mechanics of the situation. Temrash, in Tobias's head, has made Tobias put on morph armor. Tobias switches on his morph version, and the two Tobiases prevent Temrash from taking control. Then Temrash crawls out Tobias's ear. Problem: Tobias has not yet demorphed, so Temrash should be in Z-space. But okay, assume that Temrash somehow caused Tobias to put on morph armor around himself without getting sucked into Z-space. Then Temrash should have no control over the Z-space Tobias, and should not be able to hear his thoughts. Z-space tobias should then just be able to threaten to demorph and kill Temrash.

6.  The Chee have given Tobias something. I wonder if it's a device that can disable the Chee's violence censors and unleash their full power, like in the original series? Also, given that the one Chee had to blow his cover in order to stop violence, I'm forced to ask something that one of the characters asked a long time ago: what /were/ the Chee doing during the Holocaust and various other conflicts in history? Surely some of them would have had to blow their cover to stop the violence?

7.  Yeerks can morph now, and for long periods of time too, which is actually pretty cool and changes a lot. If morphing ability can remain even after the sharing, then yeerks would no longer need hosts at all to experience the world - they could just morph whenever they wanted to leave the yeerk pool.

8.  Visser Three has used a virus to genetically modified humans to produce Kandrona. That's not good.

9.  I'm interested to see where the plot with the new yeerk coalescion Terra goes. Can Terra become powerful enough to overthrow Visser 3 in 5 weeks? I doubt it. But if the Chee can be unleashed - maybe. Or maybe just give the morphing power to every Yeerk in Terra to accelerate Terra's ability to do things.

10. Oh hey, Crayak is going to use Visser 3 to create the Howlers. My guess is that V3 will use the Howlers as hosts for his clones. I wonder if Crayak is breaking the rules of the game here. Maybe Ellimist will catch on and have the arbiter kill him? Or maybe Visser 3 will figure out how to use the arbiter to kill them both.

*** Only Tom was left alive in his original body after the near-total-party-kill, and he didn't have David's DNA. Also, only Tom and Tobias had extensive memories of David, and they didn't really care to bring him back, and the other resurrectees have no strong motivation to just based off the stories Tom told them.

My guess is that the Chee were straight-up hiding. In a world before internet and camera surveillance, I imagine they could and /did/ intervene from time to time, due to on-the-spot compulsion, and generally got away with just seeming like very strong, very fast humans.

The Yeerks-can-morph thing is going to end up being fragile. They can only keep the morphing power if they maintain approximately the same body; significant changes during the sharing disorganizes the necessary hardware too much. So giving individual shards of Terra morphing power isn't really a way out, except for small edge cases (like, Terra spawns off a shard that doesn't have any desire to return to the coalescion and is comfortable being its own person independent of the pool WAIT NO---)

**** A few questions that you might have answered elsewhere:

1. When was this genetic modification virus introduced?

I was under the impression that the morph tech would have prevented genetic modification, since you morph back into a copy of yourself stored on the z-space computer. Or did we lose that when we retained injuries on the original bodies (re: ax)?

​

1. Tobias was talking about ear plugs, but I'm assuming that was just for the person he was talking to? Clearly he doesn't have earplugs at the time, since otherwise Temrash would have been shredded (which would have been a hilarious bit of anticlimax).

You do not morph back into a copy of yourself; it's been a recurring part of this canon (since ch.1) that what happens when you morph is your actual, physical body gets stashed in a pocket dimension.

Yeah, Tobias was somewhat bluffing about the earplugs. He doesn't have any.

Dolphin sex is the least of what is possible. Do you have any idea how much potential the morphing power has for "hanky-panky?" For example, I'm pretty sure the following scene has already happened off-screen:

I don't get why Tobias wouldn't think this is the likely outcome, and why Temrash would then keep his word.

Assuming everyone is running on timeless decision theory and would cooperate in /real/ prisoners dilemmas seems wrong to me.

I think the Chee are only forced to stop violence in their immediate area, not to police the world for faraway violence they know about. So when they saw the writing on the wall before WWII, but while it was still just a "feeling" and not a big enough certainty to trigger the Censor, they had time to get out of Europe or go into sleep mode.

I think they would do this because they calculated that the exposure of alien robots on earth may constitute a real existential threat to dogs, while a Nazi takeover of civilization would not.

** Booooooh! After all this time waiting, I thought we'd have the best chapter in the world, instead all we had was an action-packed, character-driven mini-arc full of worldbuilding, mind-blowing character moments, and quiet insights on the nature of transhumanism and ethics, followed by another interlude giving us a window into the working of Ellimist/Crayak, that were all absolutely worth the wait! Booh!

--------------

- Aaand /The Recknoning/ is now forever known as "that fic where Tobias maybe has gay sex with a dolphin". The journey is finally complete.

#+begin_quote
  “So what?” I said, rising to my feet. “You'll just bring me back again.”
#+end_quote

- I mean, I get where you're coming from, but maybe don't treat cancer patients like they're disposable fuel you can burn through to make up for a lack of conservation instinct?

- I don't get what's happening the moment when Tobias argues with Ax and has flashbacks about his chat with Garrett. His body was saved during this conversation, so there's no way he remembers it, right. Or did the morphing process somehow give him fragments of Garrett's memory? That seems a little too science-fantasy for this fic.

#+begin_quote
  Was it all just---empty? Me trying to live up to Garrett, and Garrett trying to live up to me, each of us following the other one around in circles, and all of it based on absolutely nothing, just smoke and mirrors---
#+end_quote

- Yes, Tobias, you're very smart for figuring out your own character arc. Now go and shoot things already.

- I'm a little confused by what happened to Tobias. Garrett morphed into him, then stayed past the morph limit. Did Tobias stay conscious then? Or did Tom have to stash a catatonic body with him through airport customs and everything? If that's the case, why did Tobias wake up first, and how did he know about the extra cancer patients?

- I'm not sure how much sense Tobias's plan to register for infestation makes. Tobias is white, and according to Wikipedia virtually all white people in Madagascar are descendant of colons. The odds that the lottery winner in Madagascar happens be an /undocumented/ white kid seem low enough to be suspicious. Then again, maybe the yeerks did little to no background checks on the applicants, since they have physical security against weapons, and they can just scan their minds for long-term problems.

- Also, he's going in as himself. Given the security at the pool, it /has/ to have facial recognition. Don't the yeerks know his face? Come to think of it, they might not: he doesn't have a driver license, he probably never used Facebook, and Ventura was destroyed. I don't know how centralized ID databases are in California (and besides, the yeerks don't have easy access to those anymore), so it's possible all records of Tobias's existence were destroyed. On the other hand, the yeerks figured out their identities pretty early, so they might have sent a photo to the mothership.

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile, I would maintain control of the Yeerk in my own head by threatening to demorph it away if it attempted to raise the alarm
#+end_quote

- Yeah, I can see why Marco didn't like that plan. It has about has many holes as an anthill under machine-gun fire.

- (although Tobias could always unlock construct!Tobias's memories, use them to prove Temrash's existence (but hide the fact he's here) and tell the yeerk "if I die, the last shard of Aftran dies with me")

#+begin_quote
  Visser Three tended to go big, not small. Giants, monsters, the most powerful and frightening species from all across the galaxy. Like the creature he'd turned into when he killed Elfangor.

  The room was a brightly lit cube, maybe fifty or sixty feet on each side, with walls and floor and ceiling made of large, square panels of shiny red metal. There was no obvious exit---now that it had shut, it was impossible to tell the door apart from any of the other panels.
#+end_quote

- An alien face appeared. It looked at us in turn, and grinned. "Welcome", he proclaimed, "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENF23NZJ8kM&t=20s][to the Box]]. My name is Moralo Eval."

#+begin_quote
  "For this test, we ask that you please find a comfortable place to sit on the floor, at least one meter away from each other person."
#+end_quote

- "Do not mind the guards currently pointing machine guns at you. For your own safety, please don't make any sudden move, or sneeze in a threatening manner."

#+begin_quote
  Had they---did they have an anti morphing ray?
#+end_quote

- Of course they /oooooh/... none of them knows what happened because nobody made it back from Visser 3's trap!

- Oh. Oh wow. We're doing this then? /Awesome/. Controller chapters are the best!

#+begin_quote
  /You're stronger than that!/ Temrash laughed again.
#+end_quote

- Well, you can take the asshole alien slug out of the innocent human head, but you can't take the asshole out of the alien slug.

- So we're getting a glimpse into what Tom's life was like for all these weeks, uh? Makes you wonder why he's even willing to put up with Ax at all.

#+begin_quote
  “Help me,” Temrash said, with my voice.
#+end_quote

- Aaaaand you fucked it up. Tobias's dumb plan was going /almost/ smoothly, and you fucked it up by fucking with Tobias and making dolphin jokes instead of going back to mite form.

- Speaking of which, you have to wonder what the effects of putting a morph-capable yeerk in a coalescion will be. If morphing really is nanobot-based, there's a possibility that the entire coalescion will get the power-up after some time, right? (or die horribly because of morph-tumors because we're kind of using this technology in ways it /really/ wasn't meant for)

- I wonder who was controlling the guards. It could be Visserbots, but Esplin does love his disposable nameless minions, and probably wouldn't be too comfortable giving a bunch of Visserbots free range for too long. It's probably Silat (the other coalescion Visser made off-planet).

- Which either way, raises the question: how does Visser 3 even have Controller agents in the dome? Everyone who gets in and out is controlled, and you'd think people would get suspicious if everyone on security duty was routed through a different pool with no government oversight. Plus, given what we know about Silat and how the agents react in this chapter, I don't quite think they'd be able to sell the whole "we totally believe in the power of love" spin that Telor is banking on.

#+end_quote

- Wait, I thought they were going to the pool? Is it open-air? I guess it /would/ feel more natural to the yeerks. Plus, they're in Brazil, winters probably aren't that harsh.

#+begin_quote
  Or not. Everything we'd just thought of might be completely wrong.
#+end_quote

- Yeah, the middle of a full-scale assault isn't the moment to play Light Yagami, Tobias.

#+begin_quote
  <There's an argument to be made that it's more important to preserve my cooperative relationship with an Andalite than to rescue one random coalescion,> Temrash said, in a tone that was almost dry. <And let's not forget who's actually in charge, here.>
#+end_quote

- You asshole!

#+begin_quote
  The taste of chocolate chip cookies flooded my mouth.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  The swift and casual betrayal, the absolute disrespect for anything like my wants, my priorities, my personal sovereignty---and then the almost nonchalant reversal, as if it hadn't even been a big deal, as if it wasn't even afraid that I might carry a grudge---
#+end_quote

- I like this part. Temrash's kind-of-betrayal makes a lot of sense to me. He wasn't consciously thinking he would double-cross Tobias, he wasn't trying to enact some master plan, he just had an opportunity to take control and did, and he just /didn't care/ how it would end for Tobias or what the long-terms consequences would be, because he doesn't even /understand/ the notion that consequences are something that apply to him.

- Another possibility is that Telor could have created Terra to hedge its bets.

- And I love how informal this is. Tobias doesn't need to sign any papers or go through a waiting period or a ritual. The lady just pokes the big gray sludge, "Hey, we have a people, cough it up", and bam, free yeerk.

- Ellimist aside, I'm not sure I understand why Telor wanted the Animorphs to meet Terra so desperately. They already have access to a morph-capable host and a clone of Tyagi, there's not much the Animorphs bring to the table, from Telor's point of view.

#+begin_quote
  “Would you like to join the Sharing?” she asked.
#+end_quote

- You know, in any other Animorphs fic, when a kind old lady asks you that question, you're supposed to say "No!" and then shoot her in the face.

--------------

Something this fic gets amazingly right, is that right now I'm thinking "I wish every chapter was a Tobias chapter", but then the next Rachel chapter will come out and I'm going to think "I wish every chapter was a Rachel chapter", and so on. These characters are all great (though Tobias and Rachel are my favorite; they just don't fuck around).

Although I would like it if every single chapter from now on was a Controller chapter.

  Temrash's kind-of-betrayal makes a lot of sense to me. He wasn't consciously thinking he would double-cross Tobias, he wasn't trying to enact some master plan, he just had an opportunity to take control and did, and he just didn't care how it would end for Tobias or what the long-terms consequences would be, because he doesn't even understand the notion that consequences are something that apply to him.

So we have the above and the below:

  An interesting question this raises is "How sincere is Telor/Terra's reformation?". Yeerks are perfect actors, after all, and it's perfectly possible Telor would have created Terra with instructions to pretend to care about human interests until the time comes to strike.

Now that Temrash has joined with Terra, I think that risk becomes a lot more real. Worse, we now know that the coalescion can implant instructions into their shards that even the shards aren't aware of.

#+end_quote

Put the Yeerks in a situation where their survival is tied to humanity's survival, and hope the coalescions have enough of a grasp on iterated prisoner's dilemmas not to try anything clever.

Overall, remember that the Yeerks are mostly fighting for safety, and Earth has the potential to be the most powerful power in the war once it gets up to speed on the technology curve. If enough industrialized countries build space fleets, and safeguard them against theft in ways Yeerk infiltrators can't easily bypass, then Terra has a long-term incentive to integrate into these countries and earn their trust. "Empires are made of trade routes" and all that.

Once peace starts to look durable, you have to worry about subversion on a societal scale. People right now theorize about politics being secretly manipulated by conspiracies of rich jewish bankers; once Yeerks start to integrate into society, conspiracy theories will be on everyone's mind all the time. Everyone will debate about what roles Collaborators should be allowed in society; people will point out the possibility of a slippery slope where Yeerks make themselves more and more indispensable to society until they... enact some sort of evil plan, to plunge everyone in a slave society like in one of the canon bad futures or something.

Basically, every worry people have about Facebook, or far-right extremists have about immigrants, or leftists have about technocrats, except a hundred times stronger because the Yeerks /do/ have the ability (and probably the inclination) to coordinate and subtly influence the world around them. That goes triple in any country that allows Collaborators to run for office.

So you probably end up with scandals where it turns out that e.g. the London coalescion has been secretly coordinating political attacks against an anti-integration Spanish presidential candidate, 2016-US-election-style, using only hosts it trusted were loyal enough not to spill the beans. Computer security experts discover the attack, people get super mad, maybe the British Parliament considers passing stricter surveillance laws on Collaborators and former Collaborators, and meanwhile, the London hive is confused; (some of) its hosts and supporters claim "We were just doing politics. Isn't that what everybody does?".

Humans enslaved Yeerks, by breeding them, regulating them, and reaping all the keep-your-heart-beating-while-you're-in-shock, cure-depression benefits at the yeerks' expense? They could be sold, and even forced to live in one host for the rest of their lives (killed when the human dies, if their life spans are longer, or swapped out when they die of old age if their life is shorter). Humans could maybe even forget that Yeerks are sentient. Or even breed the sentience out of them. (They're so small, how can they be intelligent? They need a host to be intelligent.)

***** I've said this in a few other sub threads, but my interpretation of Temrash's behavior is that he became a lot more like Tobias once he entered Tobias. Doing what he did was a combination of being a Yeerk and being lone wolf Tobias thinking on his feet and making what he considers “hard choices”.

If that interpretation is correct, the biggest danger for Terra is the people they choose to join with. Especially because there will be less Yeerk and more human in the coalescion in general due to how they've split up.

**** re: Yeerk gender ... I used female and male pretty early on, with the assumption being that it was a combination of humans projecting their own preconceptions and Yeerks mirroring the host psychology. I think any shard or pool can at any time "switch gender," but often particular identity threads will hang on to one personality cluster or another for a while. Thus, Aftran (the singular, from the interlude) was female, Essak and Temrash were male, Visser Three is male, Visser One is female, etc. There will be plenty of Yeerks that don't have any strong gendered association, we just haven't referred to many of those by pronouns yet.

Heh. This would be your /second/ cameo, don't forget.

But yeah, in that case it would've been Ts'kyu or however you would type 地球.

re: Terra industrializing ... note that Telor would have prioritized sending along as much high-technology knowledge as possible, and also that they were initially supplied from orbit by a Telor ship piloted by Essak/Marco's dad.

If it were so easy, the yeerks wouldn't need humans.

Besides, what they need most is raw materials. Aerospace-grade steel doesn't grow on trees.

Terra is going to need someone to supply it with energy, steel, nuclear fuel, electronics (or rare earths to make them), food and accommodations for its hosts and employees, etc. Shamus Young [[http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=30943][puts it pretty well]]. Basically, to have the kind of infrastructure we're talking about, you need a complicit government with an established military-industrial complex that can discreetly swap its fighter jet factories for space fighter factories. Private interests won't cut it: as Shamus points out, corporations can't move the money and materials they'd need for a space armada without getting noticed by a ton of people with incentives to watch them.

If you want to avoid the US because they're compromised, you want, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry#World's_largest_arms_exporters][in that order]], Russia, China, France, Germany or the UK. Although Russia's government is probably still mad about Vladimir Putin's death. Probably pick Germany: they're a liberal democracy, with the decent transparency and human's rights record that implies, it's got nice symbolism, they're in the EU which gives them a lot of trade opportunities (and on the long term, gives you access to volunteers in any EU country), etc. Plus if you convince Angela Merkel to help, chances are you get France as well (depending on the current president).

Actually giving them incentives to give you hosts and freedom and internet access might be tricky, given that V3 already gave them blueprints, but you can probably provide/enhance workers with high technical skills that can help building the factories faster and better.

Keeping in mind that I'm not a NGO researcher, and that Terra would have a lot more time than "me during my lunch break" to shop for countries, here are the metrics I'd go for if I were a nascent coalescion:

- A strong military-industrial complex, for reasons exposed above.

- A strong aerospace industry.

- A high score on the Corruption Perceptions Index, which will be correlated with high public transparency.

- A high score on other independent human's rights indices, so I don't end up in a country that will keep me hostage by locking me up in a dungeon where nobody hears from me for decades. (I mean, realistically, that's going to happen anyway at first, but I want a country that's more likely to let me go once the war is over)

Given these factors, I'd definitely recommend Germany:

- World's 5th largest arms exporter, closely behind China and France.

- World's [[http://www.worldstopexports.com/aerospace-exports-by-country/][3rd largest aerospace exporter]], with 10 times the exports of Japan or Israel.

- Has the world's 10th highest CPI, 5th highest Human Development Index, 13th highest Democracy Index, etc.

Basically, it's one of the three countries at the intersection of the Venn diagram of "builds craptons of fighter jets" and "but otherwise cares a lot about human rights", the other two being France and the US. We've already written the US off. France has a 10% larger aerospace industry, but is non-negligibly lower on all human's rights indices. (Thailand is /a lot/ lower, if you're wondering). The UK is close to Germany on human's rights indices, but has a twice-smaller aerospace industry. Israel is about on par with France on human development and human's rights, but has a /way/ smaller aerospace industry. Same thing for Japan.

More abstract considerations: Germany has no nuclear weapons and almost no nuclear power. Not sure how that impacts industrial production. While France has already been featured in the story, Germany hasn't*, which would bring additional "international points". Although then Japan and Israel would bring even more of those, since they're in continental regions we haven't seen yet. Germany is one of the most influential powers in the EU, and has a pretty good international standing (I think), with very few other countries hating their guts (again, I think).

*Except for the off-mention of secret self-replicating spaceship factories, whose problems I've already gone on about in details.

Here, I'm playing around with the gray area of "could he have deja vu for something that he talked about before getting acquired, but which wasn't fully encoded in memory." It's plausibly a mistake, as an author, but I felt like I could fall back on "Tobias was thinking about talking about this stuff before he actually talked about it, so the deja vu could come from there instead."

Garrett morphed Tobias, stayed past the limit, and then was Tobias-in-a-coma. Tom was indeed dragging around a comatose Tobias and an injured (though often morphed and doing okay as a result) Ax. It was an extremely stressful time, off-camera, like the time Rachel decided to sacrifice her whole family to save the cube instead. I sometimes can't bring myself to dive into the pathos of the worst, hardest stuff (and I've heard multiple requests to avoid a Tom viewpoint chapter if possible).

Intended interpretation re: Tobias is going in as himself is that he's just /real fuckin' dumb,/ and that a Chee sentry on the outside recognized him /immediately/ as he approached the facility. They do, in fact, not have any records on Tobias (V3 does, but he doesn't share all his toys), so it's either that or the Chee was holoing him on the fly. The latter was a little too crazy to write in explicitly, especially since there wasn't really a way for Tobias himself to find out that it had happened, so I left it as a possible implication.

<3 that you picked up on the Portuguese. I've appreciated your previous appreciations about it not being entirely a US-centric story, and that's set up a feedback loop that's made me want to loop in more authentic on-the-ground culture about the places they end up hiding.

The pool /complex/ is open to air, but as you saw later in the chapter, the pool itself has an additional layer of roof/protection.

I interpreted it as being the sort of thing he would have said. A view he had once held expressed using the sort of phrasing that he would have used.

I have been in a situation where someone I speak to and teach a lot has shown that influence by independently reaching a conclusion I have also reached, and informed me using what seemed like my precise style. It was weird and noticeable.

Much more often I've said things to people that I don't remember talking about, usually by not paying the least bit of attention when I was telling them things (such as while playing videogames with them, and being somewhat excitable due to the rare interlude of pleasant social interaction, so my attention is elsewhere yet I'm also unusually chatty). Then later they repeat something back to me that they may have agreed with and I do a double-take. /They're inside my head!/

** Tobias was my favorite character in canon, and I love the way his "lone wolf" status has been reinforced in this story, even with the inclusion of Garrett. Without Garrett that final tie is gone, and we see his mental state align even more with that of his canon self... All while being much more self aware...

...while still not noticing the dangerous turn he's taking right away. One of the things I love most about this story is the way each character embodies a different personality and perspective, all while being rational in their own ways. That's hard to do, and you're pulling it off beautifully with... 8? So here we see what someone who /knows better/ and would obviously recognize the danger of what he's doing and how he feels if he observed it in someone else, but doesn't recognize it as it's happening to him. Which is one of the most common failure modes for even the most self-aware.

Tobias choosing a yeerk so quickly after having such an otherwise traumatizing experience with one would be surprising in most situations, but you set it up wonderfully. In general the way the character's experience and thoughts early on culminate in the later scenes was well done.

Also part of what made me enjoy the chapter was probably the way the themes echoed themes of advice you've given me in the past, which was nice to see modified for the setting :)

I'm glad there are yeerks that are turning out to not just be "good" by human standards, but increasingly look like they'll be an important part of the actual resistance. I really got a video-gamey vibe from the way they said "give us these resources and as much time as you can, and we'll be that much more capable of helping when the chips are down." And not in a bad way: it's a good way to set up the value of forming alliances and extending trust, in an even more structured way than the random empowerment of resistance cells (which was also just felt like such a Tobias thing to do).

Looking forward to how it pays off, and his next chapter with a yeerk in his head. However long that takes <3

***** We know that a coalescion can commit more or less of itself to a yeerk shard, which affects its power over its eventual host. Esplin is a super-duper shard made to take an Andalite, which are known to be neurologically rather extraordinary. Cirran probably made the first and only Andallite-controlling yeerk to be stronger than strictly necessary. Human-controlling yeerks are made lesser, and as we saw with Ax are unable to dominate an Andalite's brain, their interaction with it must be much more passive (unless that's a long-con by Temrash).

The description of the human-collaborating yeerk is of a much smaller shard that the controlling from, such that the effect on a human brain is the same as that which a human-controlling shard has on an Andalite brain. Unless, again, it is a long-con by Terra.

Curious that Terra specifically produces yeerks that can /only/ collaborate, rather than controller-capable shards that then /choose/ to collaborate. Though given the distinction or lack thereof between the individuality of the coalescence and of the shard, there may be no difference between the two, such that producing collaboration-only shards /is/ the choice.

#+begin_quote
  Temrash threw my body aside, a convulsive jerk that would've pulled a muscle if I'd tried it myself.

  It was odd, but the first thing I noticed was how clumsy my body felt---my steps heavy and uncoordinated, my heart thudding too fast and my breath coming too slow. It was like getting out of a new car and into an old clunker, or crossing the line from buzzed to drunk. It suddenly made sense---not just intellectually but on a visceral level---that Ax had only been able to pull through thanks to Temrash's help.

  I remembered the way that Temrash had piloted my body---the smooth, effortless control, the way my heart and lungs and limbs had worked together in perfect harmony. And Ruhak, offering the same help during my escape from the pool. Without them, I never would have made it out alive.

That's the intended interpretation, yeah.

**** Hmm, I see your point about it being difficult to show every dot. I do think they can be more directly mentioned though, in a way that still keeps the story down to a reasonable size - for example, Tobias could have simply said 'Temrash of Aftran...in morph' when introducing himself to Terra. For the meet-up, which is less obvious than the relatively nitpicky Temrash-in-morph point, it's clouded by this:

/<Look at my thoughts! I won't hurt you. I'll let you acquire me. We can go our separate ways, meet back up with the others.>/

This indicates to the reader that Tobias goes back to the others (with Ruhak?!) before going to Terra. It may be better to change this to 'meet at the rendevous point' instead. Alternatively, Temrash can bring that up here: /<Goodbye, Tobias,> said Temrash's voice in the back of my head./

** Intro of Tobias reminds me of Chesterton:

#+begin_quote
  That the trees are high and the grasses short is a mere accident of our own foot-rules and our own stature. But to the spirit which has stripped off for a moment its own idle temporal standards the grass is an everlasting forest, with dragons for denizens; the stones of the road are as incredible mountains piled one upon the other; the dandelions are like gigantic bonfires illuminating the lands around; and the heath-bells on their stalks are like planets hung in heaven each higher than the other. Between one stake of a paling and another there are new and terrible landscapes; here a desert, with nothing but one misshapen rock; here a miraculous forest, of which all the trees flower above the head with the hues of sunset; here, again, a sea full of monsters that Dante would not have dared to dream. These are the visions of him who, like the child in the fairy tales, is not afraid to become small. Meanwhile, the sage whose faith is in magnitude and ambition is, like a giant, becoming larger and larger, which only means that the stars are becoming smaller and smaller. World after world falls from him into insignificance; the whole passionate and intricate life of common things becomes as lost to him as is the life of the infusoria to a man without a microscope. He rises always through desolate eternities. He may find new systems, and forget them; he may discover fresh universes, and learn to despise them. But the towering and tropical vision of things as they really are--the gigantic daisies, the heaven-consuming dandelions, the great Odyssey of strange-coloured oceans and strange-shaped trees, of dust like the wreck of temples, and thistledown like the ruin of stars--all this colossal vision shall perish with the last of the humble.

** My interpretation of Temrash turning into a self-interestdd asshole was not that he had been hiding his nature from Ax, but that (as has been more or less confirmed) Yeerks aren't complete people outside of the sharing or a host, with the notable exception of Visser Three who was specifically made to be that at a high cost to his original coalescion.

Temrash turned lone wolf asshole because Tobias is a lone wolf asshole. He became kind of mean and disdainful to Tobias because Tobias is mean and disdainful to himself. He walked off with no hard feelings at the end because once he left Tobias he stopped really understanding Tobias or being the way he was inside of Tobias.

Tobias' interpretation of “Yeerks are alien” is right, but he doesn't get that what makes Temrash so alien is that he became a blending of Temrash and Tobias and acted like that once he was in Tobias, then stopped being that way once he left Tobias almost instantly.

Even if he did act consistently with staying on the Animorphs' side after splitting up at the pool, I don't understand why Tobias trusts him enough to take him with to the new Terra (slash Chikyuu, as a student of Japanese I was very amused to see your earlier comment about the new pool maybe being in Japan) pool, especially if Temrash wasn't in danger of dying anymore.
