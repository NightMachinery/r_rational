Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** I've wanted to read a rational take on a world with deities that need faith to live and give out various supernatural powers (healing magic, superhuman strength, control over metals and so on.) Hence, I've started outlining a book with that as its premise. My central conflict will be between the fair deities who reward people sufficiently for praying to them, and the evil deities who punish nonbelievers and create followers through coercion. I only have a few vague ideas about it, but I want to hear this subs advice for how to use the premise in a clever way. I'd like to know:

1. What are some ingenious way of abusing/exploiting the need for belief in deities? (Deities can be made through sufficiently strong belief in enough people).
2. What would cause someone to be an anti-theist character in a setting where deities are tangibly helpful?
3. How would religious conflict and orthodoxy be different in a world where deities unambiguously exist?
4. What are the political implications of living in a world where religious sects are supernaturally empowered?

or any other interesting consequences of people trying to take the consequences of divinely-empowered D&D-style clerics and paladins seriously.

*** 1. I would think that you would get messiah-type characters who have their own practices and beliefs which they align with a diety, without being deific themselves. Imagine a cult leader who needs to be wined and dined lest he switch his allegiance (this doesn't necessarily need to be cynical). Similarly, a sufficiently large and well-organized state could have enough power to put pressure on the gods, depending on how strong those gods are. A state religion might exist as a method of coercing or pleasing gods which the gods would in turn by obliged to support or make compromises with. Whether a state would attempt creation of a new god depends on how hard that is.
2. "Tangibly helpful" is kind of loaded. Deities, even 'good' ones, probably have different definitions of good, and you might disagree with how their 'good' operates, for example thinking that they are, as a whole, entirely too paternalistic, something that can't be solved by replacing them, e.g. "No one man should have all that power". Alternately, you might deeply care about the emergent structures of this setup and think that the structure itself is the cause of huge amounts of waste and/or evil.
3. Historically, a lot of religious conflict happened because of different views of the law and the social contract. I would imagine that it wouldn't change that much, if those differences persist. People legitimately believe in their religions, so gods being 'real' is kind of a non-issue except to the extent those gods actively interfere with warfare, which is kind of on the gods. Intrareligious conflicts would be a lot different though, because a god with two sects could pick a side, or fail to pick a side, or be attempting to hold a lot of different believers under a 'big tent' which would lead to conflicts in what certain positions put forward by the god actually meant. A god has the incentive to have as many followers from as many different places and ideologies as possible, but they also have incentive not to ever let those followers come to blows.
4. I'd think there would be many more state-sponsored religions, and religion-sponsored states, likely blending governmental and religious functions to a point that's only rarely seen on Earth. You might also see a collection of state-sponsored religions, since each presumably gives different benefits, and having only a single god on your side limits you to only a single tool in the toolkit. This depends a bit on the specific powers in play, what their roles are, and how godly power ends up scaling with the number of believers (i.e. whether there's a diminishing marginal utility of belief, or whether it compounds, or some other curve or equation to where the benefits are).

*** 1. I encourage you to consider meta tactics. If dieties gain power through worshop you would expect that dieties which religion had their followers breed more offspring and who converted other people to be more successful.I would expect that there exists a good chunk of dieties that is of fertility(both of people and of crops) and of war(to convert more people into followers) since such a diety simply would reinforce behaviour that made it stronger more efficiently than others. I'd also expect that there are dieties that somehow forms unbreakable vows of worship. I suggest that you look at memetics.I would also expect to see a trend towards fewer and fewer dieties and dieties are insentivized to take over each others followers.What stops the evil dieties from literally having breeding stations similarly to what slave owners had but now magically efficient and with the only way out of it being to believe sufficiently strongly?
2. They've experienced that dieties bargain in bad faith. They don't like the idea of superpowerful mindparasites. They think that dieties have bigger control over them/can track them if they actively worship.Can an individual make up a small diety for themselves?
3. How important is it for the diety that people think of it in the exact same way? If it doesn't care much for minor details you'd see memetic drift. Notably what happens if an arch bishop in some area decides that he wants a big diety to be in X way and thus start to preaching that the diety is that way?
4. I don't think that sects matter much tbh. State religions have so much more mojo than a sect.

** The story I'm currently writing uses ability scores. It doesn't get a lot of screen time, but it's similar to the system in The Gamer in that you start seeing bonuses outside of raw scaling as you raise your stats. The bonuses don't pop up all at once on round numbers, but they might for example start appearing in weakened form at 400 and then be fully developed around 500. For example, normal people gain and lose muscle mass as normal, but as your Strength increases you retain muscle better and better, and once you hit 100 or so you no longer lose muscle short of starvation. Then, between 1 and 500 you start getting the benefit of exercise without actually doing it, while also raising the ceiling you can hit if you do exercise. Then things get silly (As they should) and you go beyond human limits and petty thermodynamic concerns.

I'd love some input on what abilities the different stats could give as they start going beyond mere scaling. The actual stats in this story are:

- Form (Strength & endurance)

- Grace (Agility, aim, precision)

- Intelligence

- Wisdom

- Presence (Charisma, attractiveness, bullshit leadership aura)

- Luck

- Corruption (Putting points into this one lowers it, it increases when you come into contact with /eeevil/.)

Form and Grace are fairly straight forward. They just dial up parameters that real people have, even if they do end up dialing them up beyond natural limits. I also figure Grace at high enough levels might allow you to change your perception of time, speed up thought and reaction time, etc, while Form will eventually allow for Wolverine levels of regeneration.

Intelligence and Wisdom are split a bit arbitrarily, but I figured making them one stat was too much. We do want to make room for intelligent fools, as well. So really high Int will give you things like a photographic memory, the ability to sense physical and magical elements, eventually let you delve into Alchemy, etc. High Wisdom meanwhile allows you to sense 'life energy' and souls, and as the stat goes up you can sense them over greater distances and in more detail, eventually letting you sense personality traits and such. Different magic systems use either Int or Wis. Basically DnD style.

Presence is an interesting one. Other than the making you 'prettier' part, it's basically just subtly mind controlling those around you, growing less subtle the more you raise it. However, it doesn't fuel magic of any kind, so going all in on it makes you less of a glass canon and more just glass.

Luck... Well, it's useful, but the rich and powerful have spent a lot of money developing ways of neutralizing it, because otherwise it breaks everything a little too much. So it helps against nature, but not in high level combat or at up scale gambling dens.

And finally, Corruption. Although 'discouraged' by the churches, having a high Corruption gives you secret insight into terrible, Lovecraftian truths and all that (Sanity is a resource to be spent, after all), but the flipside is it really does also damage your mind, so it's not for everyone and you might want to consider putting a few points in it now and then to keep the score down.

There are also a million hidden stats that you can't normally touch, but spend a year at the North Pole meditating on the nature of Cold and you might 'discover' the ability to put points into Cold affinity. Live in the woods training animals and you might find a new stat representing your spiritual connection to nature. Things like that. These are mostly so I can throw in NPCs with unfair powers.

Partly writing this to help organize my thoughts on a story I'm currently writing, but also if you have any interesting ideas on non-obvious bonuses that could come with high stats, I'd love to hear them. I'm also planning on having the main character discover a way to trade stat points around, and since in this system the stats don't bottom out at zero, I'd especially love ideas on what 'abilities' might develop out of sufficiently negative Luck and Presence.

*** Well... If high Presence makes you 'prettier' and makes people gradually align their actions and beliefs to your interests, then largely negative Presence would presumably give you an aura of 'ugliness', and the aligning of their actions and beliefs against your interests. Now, the first boon this has is shared with high Presence, and it's that it makes others' actions more predictable. Extremely low presence means that you can be relatively certain that the people and creatures around you are going to hate you, possibly even going against their own self-interests in order to make this work. An assassin, normally preoccupied with ending your life, may open up opportunities for escape or retribution due to an instinctual need to drag the death out and make you suffer. 'Ugliness', on the other hand, has value in that it deters people from looking to closely at you. People may be inclined to look away, instead of observing you for visible weakness. They may become nauseous just from looking at you. If people are inclined to see the worst in you, and your form feels horrific, then that's terrifically intimidating, and until you get to the point where people would commit suicide just to spite you, it may be useful for information gathering.

Once you get to the absolutely lowest of the low in Presence, you might find that people are acting almost like an AI. They may start to consider, logically, that because their future selves are likely to value self-preservation over making your life worse, that it is an imperative that they precommit to actions that make the only viable course of action destroying you. They cut ties and install dead-man's switches, learn mind alteration magic to use on themselves to make sure they maintain their hatred - and in this way, because the hatred is now cold instead of hot, your low presence has now become an aura of death in some ways, destroying the lives and psyches of those around you as they attempt to destroy you. Of course, this isn't pleasant for you, either, but a superior might have some use for such a specific variety of WMD. It is much more destructive for a nation to have its government suborned with these hate-agents than to simply wipe it out temporarily.

Luck, then, works similarly to presence, save that the agent you antagonise is the world instead of people. The world is going out of its way to make your life a misery, and frankly this is much harder to manipulate than people, since the world has an arbitrary amount of intellect to work with. If you bottomed out on luck, for example, you might spontaneously develop a painful infection that leaves you bedridden but alive and suffering, or even worse, and there's not much anyone can do about it (unless their good luck and desire to see you happy outweighs your bad luck and similar desire).

*** Form and Grace are much better stats than strength and dex - form, for example, obviously also govern how attractive you look in a still photo, while Grace governs how effectively you can do a seductive slink/strut.

Extend this, split mental stats into Mind and Soul. Mind is thinking, memory, common sense.

Soul is inspiration, charisma, standing up for yourself and against evil, the favor of the gods (that is, luck) splitting out presence and luck by themselves is just too damn narrow.

Maybe have sub-stats, much in the way worth the candle does, so that the system does permit narrower focus, not that someone who gets to distribute their stats themselves, as opposed to the auto-allocate the masses of the world are stuck with. would ever be daft enough to actually use that part.

Negative Presence could be “everyone hates you”, “everyone pities you”, or both. If someone could swap their Presence from positive to negative and back they could make a good Beserker/Barbarian impression.

Negative luck seems pretty self-explanatory to me.

*** Sufficiently high negative Presence probably gives you a notice-me-not/SEP-field effect, where people just don't notice you and you fade into the background. At extreme levels you could become an antimeme.

As for negative luck, I think it could work for you if you had sufficiently high Form and/or Grace to survive the effects. Like, you end up having meteors falling at you, storms and lightning, just general chaos and mayhem. If you can survive that, the negative luck only hurts your enemies. So good for combat, but not so good for the rest of the time.

** So, I assume nobody remembers the post I made a month ago and have been procrastinating replying to some really nice comments about?

In it I was saying I was considering making my urban fantasy protagonist not a cop anymore because it made the "don't go to authorities" thing too unrealistic, since she is the authorities.

Now for some reason "police as the good guys" seems like it requires more suspension of disbelief than "vampires as sexy love interests".

So I'm going to make her a firefighter, because 1984 tells us that firefighters set fires (which can be used to kill vampires - she's a vampire slayer).

So, my actual question:

And yes, firefighters are so universally loved.

I also figure she'll know how fires work (since that's part of firefighter training) and she'll know some basic first aid. The instigating incident for her becoming a Slayer is a car crash, which is something the fire department often goes to (as well as the police).

It's gonna be awesome. And she'll have a badass uniform.

****** It's tricky, I'm trying to work out the logistics.

She's got a partner who is a wizard, so the original draft had them followed by a ghoul who they were able to defeat through a combo of having the literal high ground (they were on the top of a building) and the wizard realising for the first time that her powers actually work (she didn't think they were altogether real, it was more a "wiccan" thing for her, setting intentions etc).

They survived by not being worth the vampire's time, essentially, because they're not a threat.

But I never really liked how the masquerade was pierced by them. It involved her finding a suspicious series of murders with sightings of local vampires years and years apart.

When I was toying with the firefighter thing earlier, it made a lot more sense that she'd find a vampire house that burned down (probably an internal vampire conflict?) with no bodies (maybe she's in the house trying to save the occupant, and she sees the body explode into ash. the other firefighters are like "yeah, sometimes weird shit happens, or you see shit" but she is like "no there's more to it" - but why does she investigate more? Do firefighters also do post-fire investigations? Perhaps she could find something suspicious like, no food in the fridge or a "bdsm dungeon" that looks suspiciously real?).

I want her to ultimately have a target, but video surveillance with the (vampire) arson suspect visible plus coincidence/happenstance of the vampire showing up at the same club as the firefighter could work. It does make you wonder why a vampire would be so careless as to commit arson in view of cameras, but then again, the police force can now be corrupt (and maybe the head of the fire squad, if this vampire frequently kills rivals with arson), so the case can be dropped even though the guy investigating with the MC thought it was clearly arson.

Hmmm.... it's sort of coming together. The "gimme" becomes them running into each other In The World, which is not horribly inconvenient. EDIT: and the vampire being careless enough to be caught on camera.

********* According to the mythology, I'm pretty sure that it's the same as the reason why they don't show up in mirrors/photographs; old mirrors are backed with silver to make them reflective, and silver tends to work against classical vampires. Also, I understand that old camera film used silver in some way.

This implies, of course, that even classical vampires may remain /perfectly visible/ on modern digital cameras, because they no longer use film.

Of course, if you really want to give your protagonist a Big Hint, have the camera catch the vampire turning to/from a bat. And /then/ have the camera taken by the police before she can copy the recording, and the official police recordings shortly afterwards 'mysteriously' do not have that bit (instead, they have a visibly /different/ person setting up the arson; that guy is promptly arrested for the crime, with everyone ignoring his protestations that he wasn't anywhere close to that building at the time).

Oh, that's a good idea. That's a massive hint, believable, and immediately points to a large conspiracy so that she will be spooked from reporting this.

The only thing is - would the fire department review the camera footage? Maybe her cop DNA manifests as her being more inclined to do her own investigation. The main arson guy knows that This Fire is not one for her to investigate. But she knocks on the doors of the car wash across the road and they do have footage which they send to her personal email. She looks at it, sees the damning stuff, and then... is probably already suspicious enough not to mention it?

Then a few weeks later, the boss says, "oh, we managed to get footage from the car wash across the road, we found the woman who set the fire" and the MC is shocked because it was clearly a man and all of a sudden she wants to get to the bottom of this.

Then she runs into the vampire a few weeks later at a nightclub, observes him doing vampirey things, and the conspiracy is unwound in her brain.

Perhaps her departmental chief is a chronic delegator. He hate getting up off his chair and doing stuff himself, so he delegates /everything/ to one-or-other of his underlings. And, as it so happens, he delegates the task of collecting camera footage to her.

Of course she looks at it, sees the transformation, and report it to him. He doesn't believe her - people don't just /turn into/ bats - but he tries to be gentle, calm, supportive and get her into a session with a good psychologist, because /clearly/ the strain has been too much for her and she's snapped. (Her protestations that she really did see it and she's /not crazy/ don't exactly reassure him). Eventually, he agree to go to the car wash and see the evidence himself, all the while trying to suggest that perhaps she was mistaken and there's really /nothing wrong/ with having a discussion with a psychologist...

And then when the two of them get to the car wash, the footage is different. She /can't/ avoid her discussion with the psychologist now (and the fire chief, out of respect for her, tells no-one about what he considers the 'bat delusion').

Perhaps the psychologist turns out to be an ally. Or at least a neutral person who acts as a sounding board - someone she can at least talk about her discoveries re the conspiracy with (even if said neutral person doesn't believe a word of it, but at least maintains a noncommital facade), incidentally allowing you to tell the reader what the Protagonist is thinking without having to show her thoughts directly.

************ Hmm. I like the psychologist angle, especially because a lot of psychologists have ins with the werewolves who are keeping their masquerade very, very tight and would be on the lookout for people like Jack to refer to "specialists"(really: werewolves).

I think the bat may be a bit much, especially because if the rumour gets out the vampire may come find her to silence her. But if the footage is just doctored to change the person's head, that would serve much the same purpose.

We don't even need the footage: she can be on the scene putting out the fire, spot a man leaving (...actually, why would the vampire stay long enough to be seen? well, if we have the mage cast a spell to help the firefighter "find her purpose" or some bull you get there, otherwise the fact he can tamper with the video means that being seen is no problem), and then the video footage they get shows someone obviously different at the same place and time (different hair colour / clothing / etc). They are then arrested, managing to get a relatively short sentence on a plea bargain with a confession that sounds oddly rehearsed and doesn't quite match the scene (damnit my werewolf lawyer would be great here, but she does immigration stuff mostly so I doubt it would make sense for her to be here unless you use the trope of All Lawyers Can Lawyer Anything).

************* Hmmm. Some alternative options:

- The psychologist is /really/ just a random person with no connection to the werewolf conspiracy. However, being close the the psychology industry, she is herself in a position to start /noticing/ the werewolf conspiracy once she starts looking. Which she only does at the instigation of the firefighter. (Not sure if your wizard character could be making a living as a psychologist). At regular intervals (say, between chapters or something) you could have a scene where the protagonist talks the matter over with the pychologist; at first, it looks like you're doing this so that the reader knows how the protagonist is thinking (which is also a part of it), but then later on the psychologist starts noticing signs of conspiracy in her /own/ industry and there's another part of the mystery revealed through that part...

- Maybe the fire just happened to be where the protagonist was - walking her dog, or across the road from her favourite donut place, or similar. Coincidences like that are allowed at the start of a story, in order to get the plot moving.

- Instead of having the scapegoat give out a rehearsed confession, it might be better to have the scapegoat react with shock. He was home all evening that night! He was nowhere /close/ to the building that caught fire! He doesn't have any /evidence/ because he lives alone, but he really was, and he insists on it!

...and then it turns out (eventually) that this guy really /is/ totally unrelated to the vampire conspiracy. He's just some poor schmuck who didn't have an alibi for that time period. The judge, however, /is/ a part of the conspiracy, so he really hammers this poor guy, refusing to admit any evidence that may exonerate him, and doing everything in his power to find the guy guilty (based, if anyone asks, on the clear video evidence; and maybe a "witness statement" from another conspiracy member who insists he saw the guy there).

It makes sense for the vampires, because having the judge in their side is worth a lot more than having a dozen people each willing to confess to anything; because the judge is (effectively) a reusable resource.

I've been watching The Sopranos and I do like the idea of the psychologist getting in on it. I've got the wizard being the firefighter's roommate, but the psychologist would be a great bonus character.

Yeah, unfortunately I'm using another coincidence to get the story moving elsewhere (she and the vampire end up crossing paths a second time, and she sees more evidence that only seems suspicious if she's suspicious of vampires anyway).

I don't think the patsy being in on it or not really affects the protagonist's actions: unless she's an expert witness (and she'll be too young for that), she's not going to be in the courtroom.

I don't know if we've cracked it in a way that is logical. Probably the best way she can see something suspicious is by actually physically being in the fire trying to rescue the vampire who is dying (but, if this was a vampire hit, then.... the vampire would ensure the opposing vampire was put into pieces and burned first thing and then let the rest of the building burn to cover it).

Unless it was a dumb/young/inexperienced vampire... maybe that's the ticket. I wanted her to start out by hunting the biggest baddest vampire around, but maybe it's better to go for a young'un. Maybe a young vampire kills (e.g.) her maker, is dumb enough to leave the other vampire dangerously un-dead before she flees the fire ('non-paranoid vampires rarely live long'). The vampire victim is smart enough to have a house just around the corner from the fire department so Jack is on the scene very early in the fire and is in the basement/whatever to rescue the occupants. She sees vamp!vic burn to death in a way that is very unlike what she's seen before (the whole going to ash very quickly part), and is freaked out.

Her work thinks she's just got PTSD, the psychologist angle happens.

Now, the problem here is:

- How does Jack find the vampire culprit, but the police/etc don't?
- How could she find the vampire culprit, if the vampire legal system is going to strike ASAP?

That's not too bad: culprit is bad at murdering, so was on video camera. The picture can be published in the newspaper / online on a wanted poster.

But I think "seeing a vampire burn to death" uses up my one coincidence, right? So I can't have them run into each other "in the real world", and the vampire culprit in this situation wouldn't be moving freely because she'd be scared of a bigger, badder vampire finding and "arresting" her.

And the "vampire legal system" would have the culprit be killed almost immediately in retaliation, so that's bad. Only alternative would be the vampire realising she's about to be executed and turning herself into the police, but the corrupt police would probably deliver her back to the vampire legal system.

But the logical way for this to go would be that Jack sees vampire victim burn suspiciously, Jack finds vampire culprit, Jack kills vampire culprit (with a big dose of luck), and then the vampire powers that be are like "okay this lady knows about us and has killed one of us successfully, we need to off her", and the war begins. (Naturally, the oldest vampires won't be risking their life fighting a slayer when they can have their underlings do it for them).

So the big question becomes: how can Jack find the vampire culprit? And that is.... exactly the question I was asking to start with. I've just added extra steps /facepalm/

  It makes sense for the vampires, because having the judge in their side is worth a lot more than having a dozen people each willing to confess to anything
#+end_quote

A judge is great but I feel like an unfair judge wouldn't keep her job very long, or would at least get a reputation. There's appeal and whatnot, and if the judge is actually refusing good evidence, then that's going to be something lawyers can work with. Much easier to do framing more directly and possibly with co-operation

  Hm, I have a thought, though this OC is/was the wizard's love interest so... maybe not?
#+end_quote

There are a few ways to handle this. Either the roommate and the psychologist turn out to already be acquainted (the live in the same city, so why not?) or they meet at some point due to both being close to the firefighter and end up hitting it off really well.

It's even possible that the firefighter may be acquainted with the psychologist before going to her for treatment; that might help her to trust the psychologist. Or maybe she's not, and is /very/ surprised when it turns out that the two of them know each other.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, unfortunately I'm using another coincidence to get the story moving elsewhere (she and the vampire end up crossing paths a second time, and she sees more evidence that only seems suspicious if she's suspicious of vampires anyway).
#+end_quote

Maybe you can eliminate the /second/ coincidence, then; the firefighter complains to her roommate that she'll "never figure this out", and the roommate offers to try out a spell to help her "discover the truth" behind the original incident (or something along those lines). And all that does is set up the second not-so-accidental accident.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  How does Jack find the vampire culprit, but the police/etc don't?
#+end_quote

Jack knows the real guy's face, the police are working off the doctored video. Also (as above), Jack may get a nudge to probability from her roommate.

#+begin_quote
  How could she find the vampire culprit, if the vampire legal system is going to strike ASAP?
#+end_quote

Again, there are options here. Option the first; the original incident /was/ the Vampire Legal System - that is, the victim had somehow crossed the line, and the person who killed him was a vampiric enforcer, and is therefore safe from the vampire law. The trouble with this option is that a vampiric enforcer should be experienced enough to not leave clues (and/or witnesses) behind.

Option the second; the inexperienced vampire is inexperienced enough that he doesn't think the vampire legal system have the faintest idea who did it. He's continuing to go out in the open because either he doesn't know about the vampire legal system, or he imagines that if he hides away then they /will/ know it's him, while if he goes about business as usual and pretends to be surprised then they'll never figure it out! (He's wrong, of course, but that gives him a motive for being out and about).

#+begin_quote
  And the "vampire legal system" would have the culprit be killed almost immediately in retaliation
#+end_quote

The thing is, for a centuries-old immortal, "almost immediately" could mean "a week later". Such a trivial, open-and-shut case probably wouldn't hold their interest for long - especially not if there's something more interesting that they're all paying attention to. Such as, say, a vampire wizard who may have generated a suitably vague prophecy that suggests there's a probability that there might be a Slayer in the area soon... and perhaps there's a debate for a few days over whether this vampire killed the other vampire or whether (as he claims) the Slayer has arrived a little earlier than expected. (Which also means that the Vampires are not terribly surprised when he becomes the Slayer's first real victim).

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah; and in 99 cases out of a hundred this judge is /mostly/ fair. But when the Vampires want, then he gives the one side a decent amount of slack and absolutely doesn't give the other side any slack at all - and every time this happens, there's some seriously damning evidence against the accused (like the video in this case). Any attempt to appeal is going to have to run up against the fact that the video evidence /exists/.

He shouldn't have to ever refuse good evidence. That's too blatant. He simply casts aspersions on the good evidence, making it /look/ like bad evidence, and then rules very firmly in the direction pointed to by the fake evidence. (And it's not like he never questions the fake evidence; he rather carefully questions it in ways that he knows it can withstand)

Other thought: perhaps the "vampire who burns down the vampire's house" is actually not a vampire. Perhaps it's a human whose family has been fucked up by vampires somehow, and the Slayer finds this human, the human confides in her, and is promptly killed by the vampires (whoops), giving Slayer both inside scoop and a healthy respect for the power of the vampires?

Jack doesn't even need to see the real guy's face, the police don't need to work off the doctored video. If the noob!vampire is killing vampires, then why wouldn't the big!vampires use the corrupt!police to find them? So the wanted poster would be real.

  Corrupt judge
#+end_quote

Yeah, it really depends on how often they do that. A judge making a bad call even once a year might be too much, especially since appeals are a thing.

....

I like the idea of the following steps:

- Slayer sees Vic!vampire die before her eyes

- Gets therapy for "PTSD"

- Whines to Wizard that she's "not crazy" and she knows that something must be going on. Shows her the "wanted" poster and says this person probably knew something was not right about the vampire somehow

- Wizard quietly thinks that Slayer is stressed, and casts a spell that she words vaguely enough that it means both "help Slayer recover from her mental break" and "help Slayer find the vampire that started the fire" are reasonable interpretations

- Wizard immediately feels the urge to go to a club, and invites Slayer along. (Wizard probably has strong urges a lot after casting spells, and they almost always work out)

- Slayer and Wizard see Vampire and here we have options:

  - a) Vampire is doing something suspicious (e.g. eating a human in an alley) and they [attack and get lucky]/[follow her home and see her (get hit by the Powers That Be)/(meet with the powers that be)/(hand a fellow vampire a human snack)]
  - b) Vampire is not doing anything suspicious and they approach her, asking what was with that whole fire thing. She [is extremely evasive]/[pretends to be a vampire hunter to get out of the situation] and they [follow her home and (see a)]/[get lured into a trap by her and luck out and kill her]

I think that's all fairly coherent?

Because the vampires already know who set off the fire (/they/ have the undoctored video) but they don't want to leave a chain of evidence leading back to anyone in the Vampire community?

No doubt they have their own people to do the tracing and the chasing down.

#+begin_quote
  Oh I hate the idea of making prophecies work in a rat context. But it does give you a lot to work with.
#+end_quote

Yeah, there are some serious issues with prophecies in general. You'd pretty much need to have them be states of probability rather than hard-and-fast predictions (e.g. "the chances of a Slayer appearing here are 60%", and then the vampires experiment a bit to see what actions seem to increase or decrease the probability - this prophecy will be particularly perverse, because the more they concentrate on the prophecy the less they'll concentrate on sorting out that junior vampire, and the higher the probability will go).

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, it really depends on how often they do that. A judge making a bad call even once a year might be too much, especially since appeals are a thing.

Of course, it's worth bearing in mind here that even their bad calls are actually well-supported by (fake) evidence; probably even /more/ well-supported than their normal calls.

  What are some cool consequences of a vampire-slaying-urban-fantasy-protagonist being a firefighter that I might not have considered? What are some opportunities? What are some drawbacks?
#+end_quote

One good thing would be that your protagonist has a /fantastic/ reason to keep in excellent shape and build muscle. Heck, have your protagonist sign up for "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter%27s_Combat_Challenge][Firefighter combat]]" and she'll have an even better reason.

A drawback is that firefighters are pretty much always on call. You're going to run into some Spider-Man-style shenanigans where your protagonist is going to have trouble explaining why she can't show up to a fire on time, due to vampire-slaying duties.

Another problem might depend on what's left after a vampire dies: if they turn to dust, that's one thing, but what if a skeleton is left behind? If someone comes across a body (possibly deformed; I don't know how different your vampires are) in a supposedly abandoned, burned down building, that becomes a whole different kind of investigation than a simple insurance claim.

Is this true? I had more an understanding that they did 3 days on / 4 days off where they sleep at the fire house, but that's based on American stuff I've heard and my story's not set in America, and googling about Australian firefighters is all about last summer's record breaking bushfires when I really want the sort of general "day in the life" general interest piece.

I mean, that said, if she has to sleep at the fire house and can't go vampire hunting with her BFF then that's kind of interesting plot stuff. I think, realistically, she's ultimately going to have to quit her job to stop the Supernatural Scourge (like the Animorphs eventually stopped going to school) so I'm not /too/ concerned about that stuff.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, this is something I struggle with. Based on how My Vampires work, I think the only way to kill them is to burn them (otherwise you're left with severed arms/legs that can ultimately grow a new vampire, starfish style). I think it would probably also turn the bones to ash, too. Which is very convenient for hiding bodies.

EDIT:

I managed to find an article that covers how shifts work for firefighters in one part of Australia and here it is:

#+begin_quote
  Mr Jullienne --- or Jules, as he's known --- works two days on, two nights on, then four days off, like every other fireman.

  “Any normal day shift is ten hours long, staring at 8am. When you arrive you've got a bit of time to freshen up and have a bit of breakfast in the mess room. Usually what we do first though is check over our equipment, check over the pumps if we're down to drive, clean the station, do some station maintenance. Then it depends on what you're rostered on to do --- fire education talks in schools or nursing homes, building inspections, site plans for emergency situations, training exercises and drills. Then obviously there's a very high chance we'll get called out as well, so we fit everything around that.

  “Night shifts you have a little more down time. We still do our checks and training, but not so much community education. That shift goes from 6pm-8am, so it's 14 hours, a little longer than the day shift.”

** I started doing a mid-year NaNoWriMo on Thu, May 28th. One week later (including one day off), I just broke 20k words.

... I think I've been a bit pent up.

I started this writing project mainly to regain the habits of a decent writing process, so the first parts are probably clunkier than they should be; but I'm finally starting to feel properly warmed up, and am finally starting to get into the meat of what I was hoping to write about.

Might anyone be interested in a bit of beta-reading, to help point out how best to fix up that first section? (The tags [WIP], [HSF], and [TH] definitely apply, and hopefully it's at least generally in the direction of [RST] or [RT].)

** I'm working on the very bare-bones of a cyberpunk magical girl story where aliens are invading and the heroes who save the day get paid to do so via Twitch (or a fictional equivalent) donations they receive mid-battle and wear sponsor logos all across their armour/costumes to get a bit more revenue.

It's meant to be a rather bleak outlook on two already dark genres. Mostly I want to try something tonally different from what I've written before.

​

All that's to say, I'm having a bit of a hard time with my 'magic' system. It's only magic in the 'sufficiently advanced technology' sense, but I think the same storytelling rules apply.

My last story has a very consistent yet soft system in place, this time I'd like to do something that's sort of the opposite. Have a magic system that's hard in terms of limitations and rules, but inconsistent with its risk/rewards.

Basically, the people who are chosen to gain powers are given a device that allows them to pick how they want to change themselves based on their accomplishments. Think of it as a sort of achievement system-based skilltree.

Sneak past some enemies? You can now upgrade your costume to have silent shoes.

Kill an alien with a handgun? You unlock the handgun tech tree, allowing you to instantly transform that weapon into something a little better.

I suppose my problems are twofold:

/How can I prevent this from being too abusable?/

and, /How should this sort of system express itself?/

I like LitRPGs as much as the next guy, but I'd rather avoid levels and stats in this case. I don't mind having huds and a clear progression system though.

** I was thinking about the MLP world and I have an interesting headcanon: Celestia is only a few thousand years old and not infallible, the sun was managed by a group before that and one could speculate it was passed down from time immemorial, after all people do have a vested interest in keeping it going but that still seems a stretch. Beyond the sun just about every aspect of the world is actively managed; weather, wildlife and vegetation. Furthermore this does not seem isolated to Equestria, most groups seem to atleast have the ability to alter their environment in fundamental ways, even most species and races seem to be created with some degree of intent by previous. What if the sun is a relatively recent invention? What was life like before that? How have things changed over deep time? I mean a lot of these are pretty baseless assumptions but that's beside the point, I want a story to explore the idea of a world of rolling creation, one where the actions of it's inhabitants is the main driving force rather than the consequences of physical law. The closest two I can think of off the top of my head are Strata by Terry Pratchett but that's not really explored and revealed to not have actually happened, and Digger, again part of the setting but not really part of the story (It's a good story, I reccomend it)
