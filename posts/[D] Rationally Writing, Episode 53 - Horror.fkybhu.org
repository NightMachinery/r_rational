** The idea of "rational horror stories" makes it impossible for me to not think of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGg8Cddkocw][Abed's scary story]].

There isn't much "rational horror," and part of that might be because a lot of horror, at a base level, already does a lot of what's commonly associated with rational stories. In the same way that a lot of "rational fiction" is in conversation with existing tropes of fantasy and other flavors of speculative fiction, horror movies are often in conversation with other horror movies, perhaps more than any other genre. (This is something that [[https://kuiperblog.tumblr.com/post/187414178288/ready-or-not-i-cant-believe-its-not-margot][I wrote about at greater length in a blog post about Ready or Not]].)

One of the best-known examples of this is Scream (mentioned in this episode), a slasher movie that has [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvLpbHKV1_8][a scene where one of the characters straight-up explains "the rules" of slasher movies while they're watching a slasher movie]] and is very obviously trying to deconstruct the genre that it's part of. And in a similar vein, you have black comedies like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1t8OZn_uhE][Tucker & Dale vs Evil]] that assume that the audience is already familiar with the language and tropes of the horror genre and use that to play with their expectations by incorporating deconstructive elements. Another deconstructive horror movie is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsIilFNNmkY][Cabin in the Woods]] (where the movie sets up a world-building explanation for why all the classic horror tropes exist in a single Cabin in the Woods).

Then, you have your post-Scream slasher movies that are more reconstructive (like You're Next), where the movie tries to re-create what people love about classic slasher movies while almost self-consciously avoiding the common criticisms that people have of these movies (such as the criticisms that are articulated in the Scream scene linked above). A movie like You're Next is in conversation with the conventions of slasher movies in the same way that Shadows of the Limelight or Worm is in conversation with the conventions of established superhero universes. So, perhaps one of the reason we don't see more rational horror is that horror is already too meta. It's not "ripe for deconstruction" in the same way that something like Pokemon is, because the genre has already been deconstructing (and reconstructing) itself for decades. (Joss Wheden already made Cabin in the Woods, what else is there to say about those classic horror movie tropes now?)

Another reason that "rational fiction" seems to stray away from horror is that main of the levels on which horror operates are at odds with what people want from rational fiction. For example, a lot of horror relies on a "fear of the unknown," a terror of what unknown monsters might lurk in the darkness. That "fear of the unknown" relies on keeping people in the dark, and rational readers, for the most part, do /not/ want to be left in the dark. They're often the kind of people who most want to know how the world works, and explaining the world to them is often at odds with maintaining that "fear of what might lurk in the darkness."

One flavor of horror that inverts this is the cosmic horror and psychological horror that is associated with H.P. Lovecraft. If most scary stories scare people by depriving them of insight about the monsters that lurk in the darkness, Lovecraftian horror is about knowing /too much/ about the monsters that lurk beyond our sight. (Learn too much, and you might go insane.) It's also one of the levels on which deep sea horror (also mentioned in this episode) operates on: you don't need to make up monsters for a deep sea story to be terrifying; the mere reality of your situation is terrifying enough, and there darkness of the deeps is the omnipresent "x-factor" that keeps you wondering about what might be lurking out of sight. Space can be scary for similar reasons: like the deep sea, space is full of inky darkness, you're surrounded by +high water pressure+ a vacuum, and you're relying on a lot of sensitive equipment to keep you alive so you're constantly reminded of the fragility and frailty of your own body. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBFuiHZRylY][SNL did a sketch based on this premise]]: every mistake is scarier when you're in space.) And of course, as the tagline for Scott Ridley's Alien told us, "in space, no one can hear you scream." It's enough to make you feel a bit of existential horror even before the terrifying aliens show up. Space is a place where it's easy for humans to feel small and powerless, which is exactly what you want from a horror story.

--------------

On a craft level, I recently replayed Halo (which was just added to the remastered Master Chief collection on PC), and though it's not a "horror game," it has a lot of great "horror moments" in one particular level, which I think might serve as an instructive example of how to tell a "horror chapter" in the context of a larger non-horror story. In the level 343 Guilty Spark, Master Chief goes to warn the space marines that they're about to walk into a trap; the base they're wandering into was secured not to keep them out, but secured to keep something in. For the entire game until this point, the humans have been fighting and been nearly overwhelmed by covenant aliens -- and yet, as you approach the structure at nighttime in the pouring rain, you see the covenant fleeing in terror from the structure. Now what could be so terrifying that the /covenant/ are scared of it? As Chief descends further and further into the structure's underground catacombs, things are eerily quiet. Everywhere, there are barricades and corridors and hidden nests that look like they'd be the perfect hiding place for an enemy, but there are no enemies, only the bullet holes and plasma burns on the wall and blood on the floor, the evidence of a battle that evidently took place here -- but against whom? The closest thing to an answer comes in the form of a human marine who opens fire upon you immediately upon seeing you, barely lucid and screaming in terror about "them," unwilling to move or say anything else. Eventually, Chief a room where the floor is covered with the bloodied corpses of space marines -- and on one of the corpses, he locates a data chip containing a record of what happened in the moments leading up to their death. The recording is mostly confused yelling and looking around for the enemy, cutting to black before some /thing/ starts to show up. And then the recording ends, and you as the player come to the realization that you're standing in the very room that you saw in the recording, the very room that all of these space marines died in, and now something is banging on the doors and the walls are starting to shake. (As an aside: hats off to Microsoft for keeping the flood out of the marketing for Halo; I'm sure tons of people played through that game in 2001 for the first time not knowing that the second half of the game involved you fighting through mobs of space zombies.)

The level starts by /implying/ the existence of an enemy that's stronger than the strongest enemies that you've already faced (such that your enemies are /terrified/ by whatever this /thing/ is), shows evidence of this /thing's/ destructive capabilities without ever showing it directly (again, merely /implying/ its power). The protagonist, with all of these gaps in information, keeps pressing further and further to find answers, until the moment that they finally figure out what is going on, and in that moment they realize that they're deep in the catacombs, far far away from safety, and now the monster has come out to play. Most of the level's scariest moments happen /before/ the monster is revealed. (There's also a great moment later in the mission where, after you've fought through several waves of space zombies, you make your way to an elevator and think "finally, a way back to the surface!" only to realize that this elevator, which is your only path "forward," is taking you down, /further/ into the catacombs, and it becomes immediately clear that things are going to get much worse before they start to get better.) This isn't a menace that you can defeat, only one that you can escape from. It doesn't hurt that the flood are even more body horror-ific than regular zombies, since the flood parasites transform their hosts into terrifying shapes that still eerily resemble the host body while looking like shambling, decaying corpses. And the fact that that the parasite attacks all sentient lifeforms and you see both "human zombies" and alien "covenant zombies" puts an interesting twist on the classic zombie trope.

*** This is one of the reasons the first Halo story was so much better than the sequels, for me. It managed to deliver a wide variety of emotions that no other shooter was capable of until Bioshock.

*** Regarding the "deep sea / outer space is scary by itself" theme: the movie /The Descent/ starts out as a movie about being trapped in a cave and trying to find another way out, and it actually becomes a lot less scary when it becomes a movie about being attacked by cave monsters instead.

"Buried" and "Open Water" are two other horror movies in which the only enemy is an inevitability lethal environment...

** We recorded this one back in January, and I think it's safe to say that if we'd recorded it /now/ we probably would have talked a bit about the coronavirus, specifically in terms of:

- Loss of control
- Fear of the unknown
- Portents and omens
- Disruption of the ordinary
- Body horror and betrayal of the self
- Horror in the marketplace

I'd be willing to take any of those up in the comments: I'm generally a believer in trying to understand what I'm feeling about any particular thing, not just for its own sake, but to help better be able to write about those things.

*** "Pandemic stories" are kind of their own genre (the film Contagion or Michael Crichton's Andromeda Strain being the clearest examples), though the "pandemic genre" often overlaps with other genres, sometime functioning as an "inciting incident" apocalyptic fantasy stories (like Stephen King's The Stand), or zombie movies, or science fictions like the Planet of the Apes reboot.

Dan Wells' novel Extreme Makeover comes to mind, both as a sci-fi story that has some fun "horror moments" (as you might expect from the author of I Am Not a Serial Killer). It's a fun read if you're looking at a book about the spread of a "pandemic" that, for most of the story, is regarded by world governments as disruptive to normal life but mostly harmless or a minor inconvenience, all while each chapter begins with a countdown timer (chapter 1 begins with the heading "267 days to the end of the world").

Dan Wells in general is interesting to me because he has a knack for what he calls "psychological terror, writing stuff that is "horrifying" or "creepy" without placing the main character in physical danger most of the time. (This is kind of necessary for the John Wayne Cleaver books, where the main character /can't/ die for the simple reason that the series name is John Wayne Cleaver, and if you're reading book 1 of 6, you can safely assume that John isn't going to die.) The monsters in the John Wayne Cleaver books actually tend to become /more/ terrifying as you learn more about them and how they work, which is great because it means that the climax of the book (where the main character has "figured out" the monster and how to defeat it) is also the moment when the monster is at their scariest: understanding the monster well enough to identify its weakness is also often the same as knowing exactly what horror it's capable of unleashing, and they're terrifying in ways that go beyond the fact that they can kill you.

I think there's also a conversation to be had about "horror as aesthetic" vs "horror as mood." e.g. there are lots of stories about vampires and werewolves that aren't horror, and you have lots of books that are shelved in the "science fiction" section of the bookstore that play a lot with horror elements. (You mentioned Michael Crichton's Sphere during the podcast, which I think is a good example, and there are lots of sci-fi stories that, while not really horror per se, have lots of "horror moments.")

The demons in the /Pact/ world are like this too; it could be argued that it's a horror story in general, but the oblivion demon chapters in particular definitely had a strong horror vibe that amplified once you knew what it could do.

** One of the more successful horror movies in recent memory, although it wasn't marketed as one, was /The Dark Knight/. Heath Ledger's Joker is very much a horror movie villain; the biggest difference between /The Dark Knight/ and most horror movies is that the protagonists/victims of most horror movies are ordinary people, but the protagonist/victim in that movie is Batman, and even /he/ can't cope. Nothing he can do to the Joker has any effect (he beats up the Joker and the Joker laughs it off, he puts the Joker in jail and the Joker escapes...) and although the Joker isn't a physical threat to him personally, he finds himself powerless to protect the people he cares most about.

*** Ooo, interesting. I think it might be called a "thriller" instead like the movie Seven, if it wasn't a Batman movie and therefor automatically "comic book" or "action" or whatever, but I like this take :)
