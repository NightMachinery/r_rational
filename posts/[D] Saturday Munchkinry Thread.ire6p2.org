Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You've been given a magical power called 'shinigami eyes' which lets you see the remaining life span (down to minutes) of every person you look at (directly; not through camera, mirror, etc).

(Idea is from death note anime series/manga and should work as there)

How and why would you use it? Can you find any tricky uses for that?

*** Are you able to use this information to change people's lifespans? What happens if you try to kill someone early, or save them from an untimely death, or just butterfly effect things by flinching at the surprise numbers when you first get your power?

Options:

- Use the inside knowledge to make money, for example through life insurance, claiming to be an undetectable assassin but only taking contracts on targets you can see will die soon anyway, or predicting the deaths of CEOs to play the stock market

- Improve medical research by observing the lifespans of people in clinical trials to find out the long-term effects of a drug as soon as it's administered, or even beforehand

- If you can't change people's lifespans, you can at least inform them of their new time horizons so they know whether to save up for a lengthy retirement or to make the most of their remaining lifespan now

- Predict disasters by recording the times of death you observe and looking for clusters in timing and geography

** You have the power to open portals to any place you have been before. The portals may be as small as a hole in a watch-strap; or they may be as large as a building. You may open multiple instances and you may also control what can pass through them.

You are a person living in <Random Country>. You want to become rich using your power, but do not wish to reveal it to any other individual. You also don't want to indulge in anything illegal or suspicious that would raise flags with any governing body.

*** This is a late-game idea which needs some seed capital, but what about engaging in high-frequency trading?

Visit all the main stock exchanges and buildings for sale nearby them. Open up portals and run cables through them to transmit stock information between the branches of your trading firm faster than light. This gives you an unbeatable advantage compared to other firms and should let you make money rapidly and reliably.

In terms of legalities, high-frequency trading is generally legal, and can be rationalised as making the prices of stocks more accurate or protecting the markets from shocks somehow. As for maintaining a facade, you just need to claim that your proprietary hardware and algorithms give you an edge in predicting the markets. With the money you'll be making, you can probably afford to employ a load of quants to explain how you gained your advantage.

As an aside, it might be worth considering the answers to standard questions like what reference frame the portals are stationary relative to, what happens when you open one on a moving train or in space, whether you can cut anything with the edge or so on.

Your control over what can pass through could be very versatile, and putting two portals right next to each other would effectively make a stationary filter. If you can select types of objects, you could sort through trash quickly to recycle efficiently. If you can extract chemical elements, you can pull gold out of seawater by opening a portal in a part of the ocean with a strong current that transmits only gold to your stores. If you can select isotopes, you're a one-person nuclear enrichment facility.

For example, target bank cash vans on the motorway by setting up a cash-only portal in front of them. Filtering out everything else should even remove any of the security measures like dye packs.

Alternatively, you could yoink some lesser impact drugs (Marijuana) that would otherwise fund particularly dubious criminal enterprises and sell them to less dubious ones across the globe. The criminal nature would make anonyminity in the transaction more acceptable.

Or you could just remotely loot some criminal safehouses. Hell, once word gets out, there'll be a race to the bottom as orgs (and cops) seek to leak each other's safehouses for comparative advantage.

*** Gold panning might work. You could probably place a large portal across a river or stream in the middle of nowhere. The gold is almost entirely in the sand/gravel, so you'd need a way to get that through a portal, which would be easy if you can move portals. Otherwise I think you'd need to dump the river somewhere else so it'd move the stream bed with it, then filter it, then bring it back. Dubiously legal, and dubiously effective, but it should work pretty quick if it's gonna work.

As an excuse for where the gold came from, you could sell it off slowly and claim you and some friends have been panning for a while and you're just now selling it off.

How smart/selective is this? Can I make a portal that only transports cancerous cells? Executives that have knowingly engaged in insider trading? A specific chemical from a low-yield chemical process? Spoons from universes where the nature of dark matter is [blank]?

Cancer - Faith healer that actually works. Maybe get someone else to be the front man / miracle worker so they draw the scrutiny when word gets out.

Executives - You can yoink rich people who've committed crimes into a dark room, blackmail them for money, then send them along their way.

Chemicals - Make an industrial chemical filter that consists of an interesting but nonsensical device, like an EmDrive, containing a selective portal to make it actually work. Sell it at a high cost, knowing you have a monopoly and are immune to industrial espionage.

Spoons - You can brute force hypotheses about the laws of physics and get a confirmation when the spoon goes through the portal. A binary search scheme would help. Once you have a correct novel theory, you'll have to do actual intellectual work to prove it, but knowing the end point for certain sure helps. Once you've won your nobel prize(s) in science, you can make honest money on speaking fees and appearances. Also go harvest the millennium prize puzzles.

**** Wow! The spoons thing was a really creative one. But no, I was thinking more of a semi permeable filter of sorts. This was more of a thought experiment I was having; what if you wake up one day and find out you have this amazing ability of creating portals? What would you really do with this to increase your wealth or standing in this world without informing anyone of this ability.

The obvious thing that comes to mind is being able to listen in/observe people anonymously. Since the portal is selectively permeable; One could fashion two in front of their eyes. Photons would go one way only; so no ambient light from the other side would spill.

The faith healer thing is nice except the portal would work on your knowledge of the subject. For example, you could choose for sea water to pass through without the salt and other material giving you fresh water but you couldn't really pass an individual without their cancer cells. How would you define a cancer cell? Unless you know exactly what to look for?

I think the chemicals idea is a real world application. You get to maintain the pretense of a legitimate product without having to reveal the proprietary filter.

Great food for thought!

**** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_nodule][Manganese nodules]] are sea floor growths that are reasonably valuable and would be relatively easy to harvest given the portals described by the OP.

There have been talks in the past about mining them, but in practice the extreme capital costs tend to make it a questionable investment. The highest profile attempt turned out to be a CIA deep water espionage operation, but other companies have looked into doing it for real.

Unfortunately the "must have visited" qualifier means you still have startup costs, but getting a manned observation vehicle to the bottom is much cheaper than building a deep sea mining ship, and requires few continuing costs once you have a portal.

** You have the power to tell how any coin you are touching was oriented 24 hours ago.

When you directly touch the coin, you can sense an orientation, relative to the current orientation of yourself. (So you can't use this power to tell which way is north, but you can tell if a coin is in the same orientation that it was in a day ago.)

This ability has an accuracy of a few degrees. Items that are kind of coin like will have lower accuracies associated with them. So you cant tell anything about the orientation of a washer, but you should have a rough idea for a fake coin. If the coin is a good enough fake for it to be hard to notice the difference, your powers will be about as accurate.

*** You could use this as a poor man's GPS tracker. Find the car you want to track, measure its tire circumference, tape one coin vertically to the undercarriage and another to the inside of one of the car's tire rims. The next day, retrieve your coins to see where the target went. If you put your feet on both coins then hold a roadmap in front of you with a pencil and ruler, you could fairly accurately trace out where the car went and how long it spent at each location. Each revolution of the tire rim coin is one tire length traveled, and you'll know which direction the car went based on the undercarriage coin.

You could also use this as a secure form of encryption. If Alice wants to send you a message without any risk of it getting intercepted by a third party, she could encode it in coin turns which form a binary representation of her message and then deliver the coin to you so you can decrypt it on your end.

You could use it as an after-the-fact break-in detection system. If your doors and windows are hinged (rather than sliding), place a coin on (or in) each of them. If something goes missing and you suspect someone broke in to steal it, you could retrieve all of your coins and wait until you sense one which turned. This would also confirm which door or window should be tested for fingerprints to identify the culprit if you have a few likely suspects in mind.

You could also use this as a poor-man's day-in-advance alarm clock. Keep a coin with you and spin it on a table at whatever you'd like to be aware of tomorrow. Then, place the coin somewhere it will stay in contact with you and you'll be able to sense when it started spinning yesterday.

In other words if a regular augur predicts your horse will lose the big race next year you can create a better training regimen to get the horse closer to winning, or prevent sabotage. If your ally augur predicts your horse will lose, her prediction will usually come true no matter what you do, because her power accounts for how you will respond to hearing the prediction.

The augur would need some fairly obscene and obvious reality warping to make simple choices actually turn out in such a way that you /couldn't/ choose any other way than the observed one.

For stuff that's less in your control, it depends on how much improbable stuff is caused by the prediction.

If it's the former, work out the manner which her predictions are normally structured and plan for that. Stressful situations could help. For example, stage an obvious assassination attempt that invites a prediction about surviving immediate harm, while covertly administering a slow acting poison to the target. A prediction about "experiencing no negative effects from an assassination attempt" would be too broad to likely be made for example, so just make her make predictions that don't matter.
