This subreddit was recomended to me after I asked for manga recomendations with smart characters.

1. In general, what is this site about?

2. I'm seeing a lot of poats about "Mother of Learning", what is it about?

Sorry about the noobish questions, but this site seems very interesting and I want to understand it better. Thank you!


** The sidebar has very good explanations regarding rational fiction---sharing and discussing which is the focus of this subreddit.

Tl;dr: intelligent characters pursuing well-defined goals, consistent worldbuilding, creative problem solving.

Adjacent interests of this sub (that don't indicate a rational story but tend to be shared nonetheless) include transhumanism, anti-death, and AI safety.

** Oh, hey. You're the guy I pointed to here from [[/r/manga][r/manga]], right?

Basically what others said. The subreddit gathers people who write "rational" stories and people who love to read them. The definition of rational is on the sidebar, but the short version is, stories often focused around worlds with consistent rules and smart characters exploiting them, or generally using their wits. Some stories are actually also focus on talking about methods of scientific investigation and reasoning openly, and these are generally classified as rationalist.

The most famous that started the trend is "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", if you know anything about Harry Potter, or the simple premise of "nerdy wizard boy tries to exploit magic and science at the same time", check it out. "The Metropolitan Man" is another great one, it's a Superman story from Lex Luthor's viewpoint. It's far shorter, too. "Mother of Learning" as others explained is a Groundhog Day kind of story in a fantasy world; it also has a lot in common with your typical manga about a protagonist getting increasingly more powerful in an RPG-like setting.

There's also a few ongoing stories being posted here chapter by chapter, including rational takes on Pokémon, Avatar the Last Airbender and, ahem, Dragon Ball (the latter being written by none other than myself).

** There are a few primary core examples of rational fiction generally used on this sub.

1. [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.]] This is what got me into the genre. It's fanfiction, but far better than the original work in a huge variety of ways. Glaring plot holes, inconsistency in how magic works, and world building errors are examined and fixed. All characters behave intelligently using the resources at their disposal. There are solvable puzzles throughout, where all the evidence you need to find the answer exists in the text. It can be seen by some as preachy, but the author /really/ hates the existence of death as a concept and was using it as a platform to explain why.

2. [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] is the genre-breaker of superhero fiction. Superpowers are creatively described and used, fighting far above your weight class through clever use of limited resources is a major theme, and many of the bizarre worldbuilding oddities of more popular superhero universes are either not present or adequately explained. Strong female protagonist, if that's a thing you care about. Also, if you care about trigger warnings, the comprehensive list of warnings it /doesn't/ carry is an empty set. It goes to incredibly dark places, near-constantly.

3. [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com][A Practical Guide to Evil]] is utterly unique. It takes place in a fantasy world where story tropes are as laws of physics: the Heroes always win in the end, the cackling villains with their human sacrifice powered doom fortresses always lose, and everyone knows it. Heroes and Villains are literally empowered by the gods with supernatural abilities in the form of Names, which are people who are also the embodiment of a story. The Black Knight leads the Legions of Doom, while the Dread Empress broods in her ancient fortress of malice, and the Good Kingdom shivers before their might for a time before Good eventually wins anyway. Another strong female protagonist. Also loads and loads of awesome LGBTQ+ representation literally everywhere. Unfinished, but the fifth book recently ended, with a sixth slated to start in March.

Also a lack of intelligence is equated with a lack of value and agency (Harry seeing no point for Ron to exist, explicitly calling many members of the Wizengamot "NPCs"), and literally the only two people in the universe who are actually smart enough to deserve agency are Harry and one other character. At one point that character says the entire country was too dumb to take action against a clear and present threat, and nothing in the text contradicts him.

HPMOR isn't considered high quality because it teaches you rationality (it doesn't). HPMOR isn't considered high quality because it addresses canon plot holes (it interprets canon in a specific way that usually translates to "everybody else is dumber than Harry").

HPMOR is praised because it's a nerd power fantasy. The protagonist has more intelligence, and is therefore better, than everybody else.

Basically I'd doubly read the shit out of purely slice-of-life HPMOR in which nothing bad really happens besides some scuffle with a few bullies and it's all just about a very nerdy kid wizard making friends, experimenting with magic, and sometimes looking absolutely ridiculous.

Different people can take away different things from a text. To me, one of the clear failings of the text was that Harry (and by extension Eliezer) fetishizes intelligence and doesn't trust other people to act in their own best interests. It's entirely possible for people to disagree with this interpretation of the text, but that doesn't make my interpretation any less valid than yours.

****** Your interpretation would have been somewhat valid for most of the writing of the story. It wasn't the author's intention that people would read it that way (this is drawn from a recent podcast he did on the book, not a groundless claim), but he didn't do much to demonstrate that he didn't mean this in the text because he (again, his statements) just assumed people would get that he wasn't an elitist douchewaffle trying to promote elitism. I'll agree this was a mistake he made.

But at the end, Harry realizes that for all his so-called intelligence and rationality, he spent the entire story being roundly outplayed by two geniuses, and would have destroyed the world the second he gained the power to do so had he not been coerced into taking the Vow. What he learns from this is that mere rationality /is not enough./ Being intelligent is wholly inadequate in its own. He needs other people to be able to make good decisions, because he is not and can never be as good as he would need to be otherwise.

I just binged the last 8 chapters of HPMoR, and nowhere in the text does it say this.

Yes, in the final chapter he ruminates on the catastrophic mistake he would otherwise have made, but the conclusion he draws from this is that he needs to "up the level of his game" and "think faster, grow up faster", not that he should rely on other people.

And that brings me back to the whole "fetishizing intelligence" thing. The protagonist is worthy of being the PoV character because he's so smart. He fails because the enemy was even smarter, but he eventually triumphs because he has a piece of knowledge the enemy does not. Even looking back on his near-failure, the protagonist simply decides that he needs to be smarter in the future, considering the existence of classes he could take to help him do so (which has an authorial subtext I'm not even going to touch here.)

******** He also chooses to stop manipulating Hermione against her will, both because he needs her for the Vow, and also because he recognizes her value as a better kind of person than him. He lets Amelia Bones have the Line because he recognizes that he can't do the job holding it entails. He didn't need to forgive Snape, but he does without reservation. He explains himself, in full honesty, to Draco, and lets him make his own decisions about his life, when he definitely didn't need to do so, and when doing so was actively detrimental to his interests.

He starts the work of gathering allies, in other words.

Early in the book, Hermione mused that Harry would never, ever figure out how she beat him in the first battle. Not because he wasn't intelligent enough, not because he couldn't learn, but because he "didn't think that way." And she was right. Harry didn't think that way at the time. But by the end, he has learned his lesson. He recognizes that having others to support you is of infinite value. He admonishes Voldemort for his callousness when he couldn't even imagine creating horcruxes for his friends, because he'd never once had one.

Voldemort was the caricature you seem to think Harry always was, valuing raw intelligence over everything and considering lesser intelligences as unworthy of existence. But he was defeated /precisely/ due to this attitude. Because he'd never had a friend who would teach him secrets, and couldn't concieve of becoming that for Harry.

Harry's inner monologue is the thing you criticize, particularly at the beginning. He does consider others of lesser intelligence as lesser beings. But he learns his lesson when he /loses/ to those people. That's the message of HPMOR.

#+end_quote

It can act against gravity, because it's a specific 3D structure that Harry keeps creating gradually by the Transfiguration. The spider silk has no special powers by the virtue of being Transfigured - it's the Transfiguration itself that allows Harry to defeat gravity. At time t = 0, there is no structure. At t = 1, there is part want, part of the structure, partially unfolding from the wand. At t = 2, part wand, part structure, closer to its final shape. Etc. The structure keeps moving against gravity because of how Transfiguration works, not because Transfigured silk has gravity-breaking powers.

The same thing goes for Harry mysteriously having control over the structure despite only using material from his wand.

Edit: That said, I'm not objective - I, too, believe, that intelligence is powerful (which you'd probably call fetishizing) - I've seen people use their intelligence to solve problems that others would be completely stopped by.

(HPMOR is kind of garbage nonetheless, but one of the few things EY is right about in between the didactic author tracts is that in both our actual world and in the world of Harry Potter, the holders, brokers, and wielders of political power both soft and hard are garbage.)
