** What's the most important thing you can do as a rationalist?

I would say it's to improve yourself for the better to be more capable of doing whatever you want or need to do with your life. Therefore it can be agreed that knowing more things is always helpful. But if you are anything like me, then you probably don't have the time to spare or have certain subjects you don't like to learn about.

Then, one of the best subjects to spend your time on, in my very humble opinion, to learn more about is mathematics! It relates to literally every aspect of one's life and whenever I have heard people talk about having a religious experience, I associate similar feelings to learning mathematical truths. The covers are so beautifully designed that I felt as if I was opening an actual book of magic.

This book does a brilliant job of simply showing off a significant number of fields math covers with two pages devoted to each concept. I laughed at some of them such as the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem][/Hairy-Ball Theorem/]] which applies to nano-technology, and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki][/Bourbaki: Secret Society/]] who is a pseudonym for a secret group of mathematicians in the early 1900s. As a closing point, I recommend at least borrowing this book from the library to get a good sense of just what mathematics are capable of and spending a few hours reading up on the most interesting concepts to expand your self-knowledge. It's a very easy book to read through with no extremely dense text to muddle things.

Side Note: I'm wondering how people will react to this book. Let me know if you think I shouldn't have posted this or if it was okay. If reactions are extremely negative, then I'll take the post down.

*** I think it's quite alright; although not strictly within the realms of rational fiction as this subreddit's purpose is, plenty of people here would be interested in something like this, I think. I will, at least, check my public library for a copy of this book, so you've helped at least one person out.

I've always been interested in math, but never really been sure where to start. If this book is half as good as you portray it to be, it seems a nice place to do so.

** Excellent book. I own a copy. It's a fun, popsci overview of the many, many topics of math, along with a nice dose of the subject's history, and it introduced me to a lot of cool theorems I never would've learned in school. Would recommend.

** Definitely interested, will check it out when I have time.

I hope that it includes some "hard" math, meaning equations to go with the milestone explanations.

*** There are formulas given with some of the explanations, but I get the feeling that the author wanted to make the book available to as wide of an audience as possible so the formulas are included only when necessary such as Pythagoras' Theorem. However there are very good references for each page if you want to do some further reading on the subject area.
