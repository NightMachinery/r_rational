Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/rational]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?

- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/5riibl/how_to_drip_feed_information_before_your_big/][There was a thread]] on [[/r/writing]] the other day about how to drip feed info for the big mystery, and it got me thinking, namely that mysteries in stories can and sometimes should work exactly like mysteries in real life. Basically just pick a mystery and

#+begin_quote
  Then make absolutely no effort at all to conceal these facts. Absolutely do not leave false trails for the reader, besides any misdirection that antagonists may realistically employ to deceive protagonists. Don't try to obscure hints and clues that you think are too explicit. Don't worry about the reader figuring things out too early. Just let the facts cast whatever blatant huge shadows they want, so long as the story doesn't literally, explicitly blurt out the actual truth right there in the text.

Eli Yun Kowskoby frames this in the context of the [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries][illusion of transparency and how you're probably overestimating how likely the reader is to pick up on the clues.]] But there's another way of looking at this strategy, which is that this is how real mysteries work. And, if you're writing a character uncovering a mystery, then this is how the mystery should look to them. And, if the audience is meant to be immersed in that character's perspective, then this is how the mystery should look to the audience.

Take the mystery of a table. I don't know how the table I'm writing this on got made. This is the "important and plot-determining background facts that your viewpoint characters won't know and that the text is not going to state explicitly until the end of the story." No one's even trying to hide it, I just don't know and there's not an obvious way to immediately find the answer. But the consequences of the fact of how it was made are shown openly throughout the world in the logical manner of whatever those facts are. These facts create a breadcrumb trail that I can follow if I'm smart and determined - find out the company that sold the final product, call them about who they got it from, track down various people related to the unfolding supply lines and question them at knife-point until I can piece together how a table is made in a global economy.

I think a lot of writers probably think of a mystery as something that involves hiding information, which is kind of true since a mystery does require some missing information or a missing explanation for the information. But in real life, sometimes the greatest mysteries are the ones that are plainly happening all around us, like gravity, or other people having sex somehow. And when someone is hiding information, that's also a logical part of the mystery, like a murderer hiding the murder weapon, not because The Great DM In The Sky is trying to make things harder for us.

The problem of writing a mystery as things just being the way they are, only no one's entirely sure why or how, are a) you have to totally understand and think through the mystery and all its consequences, and b) you have to really get in your character's head and understand what they would do in response to the clues, which is rarely what is most convenient for the story. But that's kind of the point: if your mystery isn't something that's actually befuddling your character, then it's not really working, is it? If your only goal is to keep the reader guessing, that's one thing, but it won't be the same as being carried through a mystery within a character's perspective.

*** This is so true. My advice to GMs is to make the mystery so obvious you think you're treating them like children, and then make it still more obvious. They still won't get it.

Another thing I read somewhere long ago is that part of what makes a mystery movie enjoyable to the viewer is they get to feel smart / smug when they get the mystery before it's "revealed" to the audience - and ideally you want them to get it very close but still slightly before it's revealed (seriously, next time you watch a film with a twist and you twig onto the twist, notice how the reveal more likely than not happens almost immediately after you get it).

So if you make it so obvious that the player figures it out before they're "meant" to, they enjoy themselves because they get to feel very very clever.

** Reposting a question I asked in Wednesday world building that is also a writing question...

Context is CYOAs (choose your own adventures) for [[/r/makeyourchoice]], but advice about these questions are probably also relevant for people working on tabletop RPGs, whether entirely original, homebrew, or simply a campaign.

  How do you strike a good balance between "flavor text"/"fluff" and mechanical descriptions of things "crunch"?

  How do you communicate info about the setting, balancing between players that are trying to get every little advantage out of the choices, vs. players looking for a detailed and imaginative setting vs. players that are just casually playing through and don't want to deal with too many choices.

#+begin_quote
  I am trying to work info about the setting into the choices and events and not just tell the players outright. For example, I have a pretty detailed magic system in mind, and I want to figure out how to give just enough detail that the players can work out/ imagine most of the results and implications of the magic system. Preferably enough so that most of the events in future episodes/missions will make sense. At minimum, enough so that the player's character and allies are neither underpowered or overpowered.

** How do you deal with characters speaking foreign languages in your stories? By the middle of my story, my viewpoint character speaks English and is decent enough at French, so when he makes a new friend they proceed to speak French to each other for the rest of the story. I introduce her as speaking French and mentions he replies to her in French. The fact they speak French to each other isn't important, it's just the logical conclusion of an English/French speaker and French/Italian speaker becoming friends. Should I just assume the reader will know that they speak French together? Should I not bother mentioning it because if the reader thinks they're speaking English it's not important? Should I scour their dialogue and replace words my English/French speaker may not know with simpler versions, and/or mention him not able to find the words?

(Yeah I know I'm overthinking this...)

Also, any advice on the bechdel test? My story is vampire yaoi so it has a male viewpoint character and the other major character is also male. I have a scene where I have some female characters together that I can expand a bit to give them some dialogue, but to be honest as much as I love the bechdel test I hate the idea of pandering to it. My go-to example of pandering to the bechdel test is [[http://www.discordcomics.com/comic/shades-of-a-091/][this page of a comic strip]] (this is an absolutely excellent comic though!) - the characters are talking about their dogs for one panel that was included purely for the bechdel test (the author states as much). The characters never come back, the dog never comes back, it's all just completely pointless. I'm worried about my "opportunity for bechdel" scene being similarly pointless, though when discussing it with my husband he said "what is actually happening in the scene though?" and I replied "well, the characters are bored. they've done this a hundred times, and it's become routine". So I suppose I can have the characters discussing whether they think it's going to be a long time until they're finished, maybe doing some gossip, etc. It would provide a lot of contrast to the main character's thoughts which are full of panic and nerves because he's never been involved in this particular ritual before.

*** One way to write dialogue in another language is to translate it but keep the vocabulary and word order just sufficiently different from Standard English that it reminds people. Dorothy L Sayers used to do this by (I think) writing in French and then translating to English. If your French isn't up to that you could translate it to French and back with Google Translate and then smooth off the more annoying edges...

**** Thanks for the suggestion! My French is decent though it's only a happy accident that they ended up in a French speaking country. I will go through the dialog with a fine tooth comb in the next week or so and see if I can meddle with it a bit. One of the characters is a funny sort but in a kind of dry way, though, so I will have to take extra care to make sure she doesn't lose that.

*** There have been a handful of books out there that have major dialog in two languages. My favorite incarnation had Chinese conversation being just normal English, while English conversation was italicized. So long as you only had two (or possibly three) languages and it was important to convey when different forms of communication are occurring, this is a fine way to portray that.

**** Hmm, something like that might be good. Unfortunately, I have dialogue in English, French, and Italian (probably 90%, 8%, 2% or something).

That said, it isn't important to convey when different languages are being used - if everyone spoke in English all the time it would be exactly the same. So I might stick to mentioning it once or twice. I also changed some sentence construction in parts of dialogue that were in French (e.g. French doesn't really have the gerund, so I removed most gerunds that would not have an obvious French equivilent from the originally-French dialogue).

** I don't know if this is the right place for this question, but here goes: how can I learn to write Slytherin (i.e. political & plotting) characters? I'm mostly Hufflepuff with a side of Gryffindor, I barely understand politics and I can't plot to save my life, so naturally I have a very hard time modelling these types of characters. It limits my creativity. Is there any hope for me?
