Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I am working on some heroes/villains and powers stories and I want my stories to be as rational as possible. However, the more I read the posts in this subreddit, the more I see the concept of Rationality is larger and more multi-faceted than I had realized.

Do any of you have some suggestions on reading material? Stories are ok, but mostly I am hoping for writers/readers talking about what defines Rationality for them.

*** I think you also need to remember, as DaystarEld said, a Rational character is just someone who acts logically according to their stated motivations and background. As the sidebar says, a rational story is where nothing is pulled out just because the plot requires it, the characters don't have "good" and "evil" but reasonable motivations, and the laws of physics/magic/etc in your world are logical and self-consistent. Something like /The Martian/ is a good popular example. That's it. Really simple, basic. No deep subculture behind a rule that amounts to "the story makes logical sense".

Unless you are specifically going for a rational/ist/ story, you don't need to worry about replicating e.g. HJPEV in terms of having your characters do science experiments, talk about cognitive biases, etc. So you don't need to go reading The Sequences or learning cognitive biases unless you're writing a story about the sort of person who'd know about them.

Like, the story I'm writing, I actually wrote out the story from the bad guy's point of view and realised that if I was told the bad guy's story and the good guy's story I'd actually think the bad guy was in the right. That's the sort of thing that's important, having even an antagonist with good motivation, rather than Captain Planet villains who are just polluting the earth for no reason whatsoever.

So yeah, focus more on writing tips than learning inductive reasoning (unless you are genuinely fascinated by inductive reasoning in which case go for it).

**** Thank you. It sounds like I am already planning exactly this. I want my characters to act intelligently, respond reasonably, and for my system of powers to be intelligently put together.

I've spent the last 10 months just working on the mechanics, background and writing skills. I have put a lot into consistency and logic of the system. Will it be any good? idk, but I am having fun regardless.

*** Over time I've come to more concretely define a distinction between /people who are intelligent and rational,/ and /aspiring rationalists./

There's something beyond those two first traits that feels like it's missing in non-rationalists I know (many close friends among them), and it really impacts the conversations and sense of "aliveness" in the relationships when discussing anything relating to science, philosophy, politics, and even less "weighty" things.

It's not quite a difference in epistemology, but more how one acts to improve their epistemology. More than just curiosity, it's that /drive/ to be curious as a verb, and constantly self-improve and test ideas and worldview and perspective. It's not just a doubt of one's own confidence in things, but then being willing to put a number on what their confidence actually is, then deliberately seek info that would change it not just upward or downward, but both.

People are smart as a noun. People are rationalists as a verb.

And I really think of it like a hobby now more than anything, in terms of there being some undefined quality that makes someone a potential aspiring rationalist or doesn't, regardless of how smart they are. It feels a bit denigrated by the association of that word, but... you can't make someone like anime if they don't like anime. No matter how much they might seem like someone who would enjoy anime, all you can do is expose them to different kinds and either they catch fire or they don't.

I absolutely agree. Aspiring to be a rationalist in many ways feels very similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development][personal development]] which is very much a hobby in the sense that it's something that you very much enjoy and put time and effort into doing. I haven't ever interacted with anyone who attempts to be more rational and didn't enjoy the process in some way.

*** Yudkowsky's [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][series on writing]] would be a good starting point. There's also the Rationally Writing podcast, which covers what's out there pretty exhaustively... but it has a somewhat low insight-to-total-content ratio, to be honest (eg, you'll be spending a lot of time listening to it, and not get that much out of it).

Otherwise, don't try too hard to fit "rationality" into a "genre". Rational fiction as it's understood on this subreddit is less of a genre with codes and more of a bunch of specific qualities that people like in a story (self-aware characters, coherent worldbuilding, a balancing act between dramatic storytelling and having character display agency and address situations intelligently).

In other words, don't focus too much on being "as rational as possible", especially if it's your first story. Things like building a narrative arc, creating compelling personalities, and having interesting conflicts is more important than having generic american-like characters be very rational about how they use their generic superpowers to fight a generic well-intentioned-but-but-still-evil supervillain.

*** Hi. I'll mention some points that I don't think get talked about enough on this subreddit:

1) Rational stories require a high degree of /realism/. Without events developing in a realistic way, any solution by the characters will feel like an asspull.\\
2) Rationality is not the same as being smart. In The Need to Become Stronger, the main character's teacher tells his pupils over and over not to be clever, because if you optimize for seeming smart then you're not optimizing for winning. More generally, there is always a tradeof between optimizing for being X and optimizing for seeming X, and society will always optimize for seeming X. So rationality, in a nutshell, is about making the hard choice of sacrificing social status in order to do the right thing.*\\
3) Strategy is not the same as tactics. The most common flaw in 'rational' fanfiction is to take the exact same conflict as in canon, and then make it play out in a more clever way. In order to write a real rational story, you have to ask yourself if that conflict would ever even happen in the first place. You have to throw everything out and let the characters determine the story. And this also applies to rationality itself: You have to be willing to forget everything you think you know, disregard everything society tells you, and rebuild an entire theory of how the world works from scratch.

*HPMOR kind of cheats in this regard, because HJPEV gets so many free goodies at the start of the story that he can basically get away with behaving however he wants without ever paying a price for it.

*** Rationality in general? The canonical source is probably [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][the sequences]], which is a series of posts on the topic by Eliezer Yudkowsky and others.

** As I commented elsewhere... I have no snout and I must scream.

[[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611007/researchers-are-keeping-pig-brains-alive-outside-the-body/?utm_campaign=social_button&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2018-06-14]]

This actually sounds pretty freaky. It's getting close to brain-in-a-jar levels of preservation, enough that there's talk of establishing ethical guidelines for human brains. In fact, I already find pretty disquieting the idea of doing it with animals - I don't think, if the brain got to the stage of being conscious, it would be on par with any of the other ethical standards we apply to animal experiments.
