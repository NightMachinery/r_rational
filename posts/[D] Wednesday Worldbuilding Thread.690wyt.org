Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** *tl;dr: need some neat magic bows*

I gave one of my D&D (5E) players a magical weapon, the Copy Bow, which can copy the magical properties of bows and mimic them. He's had the idea to go into a magic mart (which exist in this setting) and spam copy every bow he can find. I'm totally in favor of this, since it sounds cool to me, but I need some bows - there are very few magic bows in the core book and I want them to be (mechanically) interesting while still not being overpowered for level 6-10. Some examples:

- Frog Bow: This +1 longbow is decorated with lily pads and always slightly damp to the touch. Any arrow fired from this bow will turn into a frog. Because frogs are not terribly sharp, they will only do 1d3 damage. Likewise, range is reduced by half.

- Vector Bow: This +1 shortbow is angular with hard edges, as though its builder despised curves. Arrows fired from it are not subject to gravity, wind, or air friction. Instead, the arrow will travel on forever at a constant speed until it strikes its target (assuming it was aimed true). Long range on the Vector Bow is infinite so long as you have line of sight (though it still carries disadvantage as normal).

- Tincture String: This longbow comes with a small funnel on the side, into which various liquids can be poured as an action. Thereafter, a command word allows the weilder to fire an arrow composed entirely of the chosen liquid, which will fly through the air and splash on its target. Due to the magic of the bow, this can also be used to administer potions which would otherwise need to be swallowed.

I've got ~30 of these so far and would like some more. If it matters, this is for my "there are loads and loads of gods for even very minor things like tying your shoelaces" setting, which partly helps to explain why someone would ever make something as weird and pointless as a bow that turns its arrows into frogs.

*** Grappling bow: Any arrow fired from this bow is automatically attached to the bow by a magical string. This string is weightless and inertialess and extends in length to match the speed of the arrow until the arrow hits its target. The arrow automatically sticks to the target, and the string (magically as as strong as silk rope) exists until the command word is spoken, allowing the wielder to (for example) swing across a chasm by holding onto the bow. Assuming, of course, that whatever the arrow is stuck to can hold the user's weight.

Net bow: Fires a net which entangles and traps its target.

Solar bow: Any arrow fired from this bow detonates in a flash of solar energy on impact. Always destroys the arrow. Much sought after by vampire hunters; though the flash of light will still often blind those that are not harmed by it.

Camouflage bow: The wielder's colours will change to almost but not quite match the scenery behind him, rendering him harder to spot.

Deluge Bow: Every arrow fired by this bow will become two identical arrows on striking the target. Both arrows disintegrate after doing normal damage. (Named because it's easy for a force armed with this bows to fire a vast deluge of arrows)

Exchange bow: On a successful ranged attack against a living creature (doing damage as normal) the wielder and the target are both teleported to each other's positions. The favoured weapon of Hank the Suicidal, who liked to jump off a tall building or take some similarly suicidal action shortly before firing it at an enemy. (Hank the Suicidal eventually died shortly after his bow was replaced by a non-magical duplicate).

Spellbow: Casting a touch-range spell on this bow will cause the next arrow fired to deliver that spell to its target on a successful hit.

Sleep bow: A successful hit may cause the target to fall asleep. Generally used in training exercises.

Eartheater: Arrows fired from this bow do no damage to living creatures. Instead, if it hits earth or stone, a large volume of earth or stone is simply annihilated. Can be fired at someone's feet to create a pit.

Trick bow: If two arrows are fired from this bow in quick succession, the second will always hit the first mid-flight. Great for impressing people who have never heard of the bow, but not particularly useful in combat.

*** Hmm, I have a few ideas, no clue about balance though:

- Traceless Bow: Is completely silent (both when firing and when the arrow strikes something), and also casts /mending/ on any object that it strikes, removing any damage it causes.
- Tracer Bow: Arrows fired from this bow glow with light as bright as a torch, starting from when the arrow is drawn and ending one round after it strikes a target.\\
- Boomerang Bow: Arrows fired from this bow will attempt return to the shooter after striking a target. If it is stuck in an object or creature, this deals 1 additional damage the following round. If not, the arrows land near your feet the round after they were fired. You still only recover half of your ammo, with the other half breaking.
- Universal Bow: Can fire arrows, bolts, sling bullets, and blowgun darts interchangeably.
- Stasis bow: After drawing, you can press a button on the grip of the bow to lock it in its fully drawn position, and press it again to release the effect. In this form, it acts as a one-handed ranged weapon that you do not have proficiency in.

*** I'm rubbish for numbers, but here's some ideas:

Trap Bow: Upon releasing the string to fire, the bow shatters, dealing damage to the wielder.

Smokewood Bow: Any arrows fired from this bow pass through wood as if it were smoke. Variants could exist for a variety of target materials.

Soulsplit Bow: Every time the bow is fired, the string will cut into the forearm of the offhand (unless it is heavily armored), dealing 2d4 damage. If the arrow hits, the damage dealt to the wielder is added to the unit hit.

Breach Bow: Every arrow fired from this bow blinks past the first target (or up to one meter of solid material) it comes across, hitting anything behind it as normal.

Empathy Bow: The components of this bow transform into the material hit by the last fired arrow, affecting effective strength required to draw the bow, damage dealt, etc. On hitting a target, alternate whether it is the string or the bow which transforms.

Roulette Bow: Every 1d4 shots, the arrow somehow disappears before hitting anything. Alternatively, only every 1d4 shots actually hit.

Phase Bow: Every arrow fired from this bow passes harmlessly through its targets, until the front half has penetrated, after which it resumes corporeality.

Dorf Bow: It menaces with spikes of elven bone. This bow somehow manages to be capable of firing small axes, and will not perform with any other ammunition.

Bow of Greed: Deals ludicrously good damage, but only when a gold piece is inserted into the slot before each shot. Where the gold goes is a mystery.

Artillery Bow: Once per fight, the bow may be invoked, placing the wielder into a trance for one round. The wielder fires four shots into the air, each on a progressively shallower trajectory. All four shots land simultaneously on target, dealing bonus damage in addition to that of the four arrows. An empty space above the wielder greater than or equal to the maximum range of the bow is required for this to work.

Reverb Bow: As a fast action, wielder may flip an arrow end-over-end, catching it again. For each such instance of arrow-flipping prior to firing, the arrow will ricochet once after landing.

Timelock Bow: Arrows fired from this bow do not move beyond the position just beyond leaving the bow. The next solid object to touch the still arrow unfreezes it, receiving full point-blank damage (if on the business end).

Pacifist Bow: Arrows fired from this bow inexplicably turn into soft flowers just before hitting their target.

Remembrance Bow: A small daemon lives within this bow. If you offer a memory to the daemon (by holding it firmly in mind while firing), it will consume it, adding damage to the shot proportional to the importance of the memory.

Bejeweled Bow: An extravagant bow studded with various sizes of gaudish fake gemstones. Arrows that land never fail to hit their target between the legs.

Reverse Bow: Mid-flight, the material properties of the fletching and arrowhead swap places, usually resulting in an arrow landing with a feathery tip and steel fletching.

Sideways Bow: No matter how hard the wielder tries, arrows fired from this bow always manage to hit their target sideways, dealing 1d2 damage.

*** I'd be worried about the Vector Bow being overpowered if the player takes the Sharpshooter feat. Among other things, it lets the player ignore disadvantage for long range, so the only limit would be line of sight. A possible solution would be to have disadvantage at 800 feet (twice the long range of a Longbow) regardless of Sharpshooter feat, provided that the target is aware of the players. This would be an approximation for the target being able to see the arrow coming over a long distance, and then move out of the way.

If you are playing without feats, then it looks great.

**** I tend not to worry about balance all that much, since this isn't for wide release and it's only ever going to be used by (at most) two players if they buy it /and/ copy it. If anything is ever a problem, it's easy enough to adjust the challenges the players face, especially if they're facing an enemy that knows they're coming.

I think there probably is a realism argument to be made, since an arrow fired 40 miles away from the top of a mountain is almost certainly not going to hit its target given that the degree of imprecision gets multiplied. At the same time, I really like the idea of there being a sniper shot that only one specific bow can make, and to a lesser extent I like the idea of the trade-offs implied by archers actually using long range.

*** - Bow of Sudden Thornwall: When activated, an arrow loosed from this bow will cause a wall of thorns to sprout from the ground along its path. These squares are impassable terrain, but the wall can be removed or destroyed with damage and other relevant effects.

- Bow of Ultimate Scaling Convenience: When fired as part of a full-round attack action, arrows fired from this bow at a vertical (or near-vertical) surface magically divide into several separate climbing pitons and embed themselves into the surface across an area no wider that five feet and arbitrarily high, these can be used as improvised steps. This reduces the climb DC for that surface to 5 for a number of rounds equal to the wielder's level, after which the pitons vanish, leaving the target surface unharmed.

- Bow of the Inverted Locus: When an arrow loosed from this bow hits a creature, that creature and the bow's wielder instantaneously trade positions.

- Bow of Reliably Unfortunate Spasms: when a creature is hit by an arrow from this bow, the strange and recondite energies within cause a limb or jaw of the creature to lash out uncontrollably for a moment, and somehow always wacks someone. The hit creature makes a basic melee attack against a random creature within range (if any) as an immediate interrupt.

- Bow of the Horror Walrus: For a number of rounds equal to the wielder's level, creatures hit by this bow automatically suffer the frightened condition for one round whenever it has line of sight to a walrus; or if it fails a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check to know what a walrus is, to any object or creature that it is led to believe is a walrus.

- Bow of Fletched Annoyance: When fired at a square in the ground, arrows loosed from this bow become sapient, capable of speaking one language that the wielder knows, and rude. This Lasts for five rounds. A torrent of squeaky insults compels foes to smash the arrow and shut it up. Provided it understands the arrow's language, the nearest enemy creature to the arrow must make a Wisdom (Insight) check of DC 20 each round of the effect to not move toward the arrow and attack it. The arrow has 1HP and an AC of 1. The arrow's taunts have a range of 60 feet and the DC is 25 when out of combat.

- Obnoxious Bow of Fletched Annoyance: As above, but can affect the nearest two enemies.

- Most Obnoxious Blow of Fletched Annoyance: Draws three dudes.

*** Here's a few, likely not balanced though.

- Bow of Smoothing: Arrows fired from this bow will turn surfaces beneath their flight path into a smooth, close to frictionless surface, 1 foot wide. Only one smooth path can exist at a time; if another arrow is fired, the existing path will disappear. The arrows only reduce friction; you can't walk over smoothed lava.

- Killer Clowns's Smile: This +1 bow is carved and painted so as to resemble a hideous clown's smile. If an arrow from this bow hits something alive, that organism will have something hilarious and mildly painful happen to it. It might step on a rake that wasn't there a minute ago, or have it's pants fall down to their feet when it tries to take a step, whatever the god of clowns thinks is funny.

- Smokebringer: This longbow is made of twisted ebony. When fired, arrows will trail clouds of pitch black smoke behind them. The smoke is breathable, slightly flammable, and blocks out almost all light. It dissipates quickly, smoke from an arrow only lasting two rounds.

- Bow of the Foolhardy: This +1 shortbow looks completely normal, but upon striking an enemy, will launch itself forward towards them. If a Strength check is passed, the bow's user will be pulled forward as well, ending up directly in front of their enemy. They may not make an attack mid-flight. If the strength check is not passed, the bow will launch forward on it's own, dealing 1d2 damage.

So if you aim at something behind opponent, it would pierce them inside out? BTW Cool idea.

Some of my ideas you may like:

- Crash Bow - Projectiles shot from this bow don't do damage, but instead launch medium sized or smaller target in a direction opposite to the archer. If there is something on their way, they will crash into it and get 1d6 damage.
- Blink Bow - A shortbow that doesn't actually fire arrows, but rather teleports them 60 ft. from the user. If the area is occupied by some creature, it gets 1d6 damage without an attack roll.
- Divine Arc - This composite longbow is basically a denial of what weapon should be. Instead of dealing damage, it heals 1d8 hit points upon striking its target.
- Shotbow - A weird looking bow containing a small bubble of warped space. It can be loaded with up to three arrows by putting them into it's pocket dimension and fire all of them in one go with -2 penalty to attack roll. However loading it is a full-round action and the range is halved.

*** Some magic bows (made most of them +1 masterwork longbows because that seems to be what would be appropriately useful for the levels you specify).

- Equalizing Bow: Deals 1d2 damage per every one hit dice more the target has than the wielder. Deals no damage if target has no more HD and deals 1d2 damage to wielder for every one hit dice they have more than the target. Bow is sized for wielder with appearance otherwise being based on number/size of HD of wielder. In the hands of a classless NPC it is the most impressive looking bow imaginable, but to a high level character it may appear to be barely in working order, and to a being of greater power it may have an outright absurd appearance such as a curved twig with a bit of yarn as it's string (that still somehow functions normally).

- Lighteater Bow: Every square the arrow travels through is put in total darkness for 3d6 turns. Darkness can not be illuminated, but can be magically dispelled (treated as having been cast with ECL 16). Does not block vision of creatures with darkvision or other methods of seeing through total darkness. Is otherwise normal +1 masterwork longbow.

- Stormbringer Bow: +1 masterwork longbow that can change weather in squares the arrows travels through. Effects are constrained to affected squares but take effect next round and last for 3d6 minutes. Weather effects are only controlled by direction of shooter when arrow was initially fired and can only be changed by firing another arrow though those squares and waiting for it to supercede the previous effect. While fine bows in their own respect they also serve useful purposes in watering crops or wearing down enemy armies through harsh weather.

- Ethereal Bow: Deals considerable force damage in addition to being a +2 masterwork longbow. However all arrows shot turn incorporeal and will thus only affect ethereal entities or creatures composed primarily of force/astral energy and other such non-physical magical entities.

- Time Skip Bow: +1 masterwork longbow whose arrows disappear when fired. Disappeared arrows will then reappear and continue on their original path normally at a later time that the shooter specified when they initially shot them, from a turn in the future to 24 hours later. A favorite of assassins or anyone who knows their target will be in a given location at a set time so they can set up a barrage of arrows to wait for them. While weaker than sigils or other such magical traps they can make up for it in sheer quantity and by being less conspicuous. Can be spotted via true sight or other mid-high tier detection magics and dispelling the area they disappeared in will cause them to reappear (but this may be very bad for the dispeller).

- Metamagic Bow: +1 masterwork longbow. However this bows main effect is that a magic user can apply any known metamagic feats to the arrows when fired, and the bow can remember any metamagic feats that have been used with it and then apply them to any fired arrows. Treat arrows fired as you would a spell that did the same thing (so usually treat as lvl 1 spell, but may be higher if enchantments have been applied). When applying metamagic feats can only apply feats if resulting ECL of arrows does not exceed level of shooter.

- Illusory Bow: +1 masterwork longbow. Can apply pretty much any illusion to arrows though this must match the arrow you are disguising it as, unless you just want to act as a normal arrow. Arrow can mimic any arrow material and otherwise act as any arrow you have ever seen fired (such as that fired from a ballista). However any targets it hits save vs will to disbelieve, and if they succeed the arrow only deals 1/5 damage (basically like the shadow illusion spells).

**** Depends on what it is, but while the arrow is protected from gravity, wind, and air friction, whatever you tie to it is not, and the arrow isn't protected from whatever you tie to it. If you tied something that weighed as much as an arrow to the arrow, and considered only gravity, then it would drop at the same speed as an arrow, despite having twice the mass. Hopefully this won't come up though.

(In my campaign setting, arguments about what does or does not constitute a _____ are resolved on the metaphysical Platonic plane that overlays the natural world, where an aggrieved overgod semi-arbitrarily makes decisions when presented with a corner case.)

** I'm really tired of virtual reality fantasies where people are surprised by the veracity of the criticism which seems to place you directly in a world (spoiler:it probably magically does) and then never do anything with the tech again. Like, if tomorrow something like that came out, there would be government intervention to get this kind of technology. Any rigs would be declared a national asset and the company would get very "politely" questioned, at the very least. They take matrix level technology and try to ignore that that's what they did. It's annoying.

In another genre, I'm honestly surprised that more portal fantasy protagonists don't pay any attention to either distilling or beekeeping as really easy ways of making money. A packed column still is supremely simple to make in theory, and the only truly difficult parts of it are the thermometers and the needle valve, and the movable frame hive is revolutionary and simple in practice. Both of them were made in or after the late 18 century, well well before the Middle Ages equivalent most of them are set in.

*** I've often thought, in discussions of time travel, that the first, easiest way to establish oneself in the middle ages would be with beekeeping. Not just knowledge of bee-space and movable frame hives, but just knowing about bees would be an insane asset. People had no idea, back in the day, that bees laid eggs, or the role of the queen (they thought it was a male "king" bee), or what pollen was, or where nectar came from. All of this would give one a huge advantage in sugar production in a medieval setting.
