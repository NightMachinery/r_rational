Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Do any trapped in videogame rpg land stories exist where the top players actually use top player tactics like coordinated minimaxing, adversarial reasoning and glitch finding/exploitation instead of arbitrarily having higher stats than their opponents to solve their problems?

*** There are a few works I've enjoyed which are similar to your request, but none of them are perfect fits:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/551606][Sburb Glitch FAQ]], a Homestuck fanfic in the form of a strategy guide for glitched Sburb games. The focus here is on glitch exploitation, but it requires a fair bit of familiarity with canon. A popular foundation for AUs and RPs (I think Replay Value is the name used most often?) but I haven't read through any of the secondary works.

- [[https://www.scribblehub.com/series/3413/isekai-speedrun/][Isekai Speedrun]] is a fun read but the protagonist mainly uses their foreknowledge because the video game aspects are deemphasized.

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32291/jank][Jank]] feels fairly true to the culture of MMOs and has some entertaining ideas but the players aren't trapped in the game.

EDIT:

- Log Horizon is a good example of the genre. While the light novels focus on the politics, [[https://imgur.com/a/AkeYt][this Imgur album]] makes a good case for the level of thought put into the tactics of the action scenes in the anime.

*** Delve on RoyalRoad is a litRPG that's not quite videogame but has all the videogame traits. The story is a slow slice of life exploration, but the main character's primary advantage is that he looks at the world like a videogame to be min-maxxed while everyone else has just grown up with it as their entire life.

This means that the vast majority of the populace are unoptimized. Each person makes smart build decisions that make sense individually, but aggregate to being awful for minmaxing. Everyone builds 'tanky dps' that doesn't rely on allied buffs. People don't share builds or information. And there's huge societal problems causing a chicken-egg issue with nobody wanting to be a support or crafter because it's unsafe because there are no balanced teams to rely on... because there's no point for teams when nobody goes support or crafter.

In the most recent chapters the MC finally starts their own guild and tries to get people to minmax as a group instead of individuals, so that he can turn around the state of the world.

** [[https://www.amazon.com/Man-Earth-David-Lee-Smith/dp/B077N4M7PQ][The Man from Earth]]! I rewatched this amazing movie the other day and it's definitely something people here will enjoy:

- 99% of runtime consists of people talking in a single room, and everyone I watched it with still loved it.
- Written by Jerome Bixby, of Star Trek fame (came up with the Mirror Universe among other things)
- Rationalist to the end, from how the story is handled to the specific topics mentioned.
- Released by the director on torrent sites since he wanted people to watch it more than he wanted money (so don't feel bad if you don't have Amazon Prime).

I've intentionally kept the plot vague, it's a story about a group of professors slowly exploring the mysterious past of a long time friend of theirs, so I'd be doing you a disservice if I told you any of it. Just trust me and watch it, it's not a long movie.

It's just a full length movie of people in a room talking and exploring a concept. It's interesting, thought-provoking, and pretty easy to watch. It has a mystery element that makes it hard to talk about the plot in a rec, but it's not a huge twist you need to brace yourself for or anything.

Emphasis on science+planning, pulling unorthodox strategies to win, some tangential X-risk warnings, all in the usual extremely high quality Pratchett style prose.

** So, I've been lurking these recommendation threads for about a year now and figured it'd only be polite to contribute something of my own. I don't actually care about a work being explicitly rational, so long as it's believable, but these rec threads have consistently turned up interesting new works for me to read so I continue to lurk them.

I'm gonna cover most of my favorite stuff (or stuff I wanna talk about) that I've read in the past year or so, but keep in mind not all of these works are /rational/ fiction.

Anyways, since this comment is probably gonna turn into a huge TL;DR I'll keep it concise up top and expand on my thoughts further down.

*A Practical Guide to Evil:* One of the most popular pieces of web fiction, for good reason. I'll admit the earlier books aren't nearly as good as the later books, so if you gave up early, maybe try reading further. Definitely my favorite read in the past 12 months.

*What Defines Us (RWBY):* I actually saw this recommended +last week+ two weeks ago which was awesome, because it's truly fantastic. It IS romance fanfiction, though, so if you aren't a fan of that you probably won't be a fan of this. It's 400k words and one of my favorite works of fiction in the past year, though, so definitely try it out if you're at all interested in a romance. Keep in mind it's pretty heavy on the angst (but... justified? It's not teenage “woe is me” angst, its “bad things happened and now I'm depressed” angst).

---

*The Locked Tomb:* I can see why some people wouldn't like this series, with it's fairly irreverent tone and slow pacing in the first half, but this is something that you can read and find out for yourself if bothers you. Personally, I thought both the first and second books were fantastic.

*Murderbot Diaries:* This had probably one of my favorite protagonists of the year. A grouchy emotionally incompetent (but secretly caring) rogue AI was an absolute pleasure to read about.

*Cradle Series:* This series definitely is ‘popcorn' reading, but it's the best of its kind. I had a blast reading these books.

*Katalepsis:* This web serial is probably fairly unknown in comparison to most of the other works I've talked about so far, but it deserves way more attention. I remember stumbling upon this fairly early on (like arc 3?) and being blown away at how good it was compared to how few people talked about it. It's a pretty interesting story of cosmic horror of the Lovecraftian variety with a cute B plot lesbian romance. Definitely try this one out.

*One Way Trip/Near Light (Life is Strange):* This is almost certainly the most unknown work I'll talk about in this post, and probably something close to none of you have read (I would think?). It has its flaws, dipping into angst too heavily in places and a somewhat strange writing style in certain sections. I had a blast reading this, though. The part that I think would catch the interest of a lot of readers here is that this work attempts to reasonably tackle the idea “How would the various governments (or other organizations) attempt to handle a known time traveler?” In this heavy AU Life is Strange fanfic, superpowers are a thing (that society doesnt know about) and includes stuff like teleporters, psychics, precogs, etc, and the fic tries to handle them in a fairly rational (or at least reasonable) way. It's crazy to me that this work has less than 200 favorites on ff.net, because it's way better than even most of the popular web serials out there.

I'm honestly wondering if this just happened to hit specific tropes and plot points that made this a good match for me, because I really don't get why this isn't way more well known. It hasn't been mentioned even once on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], which dips into some pretty niche and unknown recs, so its unusual to me that nobody has mentioned this even once. If anyone reads through this, let me know if this is just one of those stories that isn't actually that good and just happened to be something that appeals to me, because I think this belongs with a lot of the big name recs I've included in this list.

*Mother of Learning (web serial):* This story is already crazy popular, so I don't have much to say about it. I thought the characters were pretty weak, but I had fun reading it nonetheless. It really lacks any kind of emotional impact, but lives on the merit of being /interesting./

*Wandering Inn (web serial):* I had fun with this, but character bloat really killed it for me. The early parts (books 1-4ish) were a lot of fun for me. Doubt I'll keep reading, dropped it early book 6.

*Worth the Candle (web serial):* This is definitely good, and one of the more cerebral things I've read, but I caught up to it like a year ago and never felt the urge to go back and read the new chapters.

*Pale (web serial):* This is classic Wildbow in that it's honestly just /great/ writing, and actually interesting too (unlike Ward or Twig for me), but continues in Wildbow fashion to be just way too depressing. I've had fun reading up to ~3.5 so far though

---

The stuff in the *Worth a Read* section are good, and weren't DNFs, but they also weren't anything amazing to me. Read them if you don't have other stuff to read, I guess.

---

Among the works above that I've read this year is a ridiculous amount of fanfiction, quests, web comics, and other media, but I can't really think of anything that really stuck out besides maybe *Tower of God*, *Always Human* and *Kill Six Billion Demons*, all of which I didn't read more than half of (Only because I'm just not a fan of web comics in general). I also read some interactive fiction like *All Night Laundry*, *Homestuck*, and *My Delirium Alcazar*, but I'm really not a fan of the format and thus all were DNFs.

I've also read a probably unhealthy amount of f/f romance fiction (both print and fanfic) in the past year or so, but I figured this was probably too unrelated to [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to actually organize recommendations for. If anyone is actually interested in this niche, send me a dm or comment and I can make a few recs.

Lastly, I've read way too much Worm fanfiction and honestly can say that basically none of it is something I would consider exceptional, which is strange considering the sheer quantity of it. Plenty of it is /fun/ but I can't really say anything could stand along the stuff I've rec'd above.

It's a fanfic based on Good Omens, with the POV character being Aubrey Thyme, a therapist who is unknowingly treating Crowley, a Demon, who is attending therapy at the urging of his husband Aziraphale, an angel.

It's beautifully written, with /some/ minimal angst, but mainly it's about the process of grieving and overcoming traumatic memories. Not much fanfic has ever affected me as deeply as this.

**** The pacing issues are a matter of point of view. The most common pacing issues in stories are not enough meaningful things happening, or insufficient variation of highs and lows in varying dimensions. TWI suffers from neither. The total amount of events is simply so large that it takes ages for any developments beyond the arc scale to occur. If a novel is like a movie and a serial like WtC is like a Netflix style intense series, TWI is like a classic series. One where excellent individual episodes are more the point than the overarching plot. Very enjoyable if you let go of the desire to see an end, profoundly frustrating if you don't. YMMV

I picked it up Monday and I'm halfway through book two already, it's balancing the OP of the time travel in an OK manner, but the relationship and the actual usage of time travel and Max's abilities beyond just a rewind is fantastic.

**** Making a list of recs for romance fiction is honestly way harder, partly because I've read so much of it and also because I didn't keep especially good track of what I've actually read. Also, romance fiction in general tends to be harder to rate quality wise over other types of fiction because it feels so much more /subjective/ to me. These kinds of stories live and die by emotional connections and that's going to vary wildly depending on what your specific favorite tropes, plot points, and character types are. That said, this list is highly subjective and reflects what I /personally/ enjoyed the most.

I'm only gonna leave some comments on my top 5:

*The One Who Eats Monsters:* I actually think published fiction is a much weaker medium for romance stories, at least from personal experience. That said, The One Who Eats Monsters is similar to Katalepsis in that the romance is a heavily featured subplot and the main plot is amazing standalone. I actually forgot about this book while writing my above list but it totally belongs in my “Highly Recommended” section. I have a soft spot for socially challenged protagonists (like Murderbot!), and Ryn (the protagonist) is a non-human entity who is experiencing human society in its entirety for the first time, and is appropriately terrible at social interaction. Read this one if you're looking for plot to accompany your romance.

*What Defines Us:* See parent comment

*white blank page:* My personal preferences tend to run towards angst/drama stories, and this one ladles it on pretty heavily. Since I'm recommending it as one of my top 5, I obviously don't think its poorly done or cringy or anything, but without a doubt it's /heavy/ on the angst. Avoid if that isn't your thing. College setting.

*Increments of Longing:* This one was just super enjoyable to me and I've reread it a few times. It's a political marriage fic between Sylvanas and Jaina and has a bunch of super cute moments. I think this one, along with my next rec, has pretty general appeal where I don't think anyone is going to /dislike/ it, even if it might not make your favorite list.

*The Love of Forgetting:* Like I mentioned above, this fic has pretty general appeal and is also superbly written. It features Lena Luthor handling an amnesiac Supergirl with all the adorableness (and suspense) that entails. Read it! It's well written, interesting, and I doubt anyone would find it /bad/.

If you've already read most of the mainstream stuff like MoL, APGTE, WTC, etc, then I'll go ahead and double down on my recs for Katalepsis and The One Who Eats Monsters, since both are very good and very under read.

Gideon the Ninth and Harrow the Ninth are also very good IMO, but have certain stylistic choices that I could see others not enjoying (but I personally enjoyed or at least didn't mind). Book 1 was about a 8/10 for me for the first ~60% of the book but really started to pop off near the last third and became a 9-9.5 overall for me.

Off the top of my head, similar stories would be:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12563/artisan][Artisan]] - mostly dead
- Some parts of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15614/daedalus][Daedalus]] - also pretty dead
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32983/vaudevillain][Vaudevillain]] - very alive, but not quite on target for this request
- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aces-and-jokers-oc-insert.796551/#post-62075730][Aces and Jokers]] - more conceptual tinkering than physical, but it fits reasonably well I think.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33844/the-runesmith][The Runesmith]] - seems like the author intends for it to get there, but it hasn't so far

*** If you're up for xianxia, /Forty Millennia of Cultivation/ at least approaches what you're looking for. It's heavier on fighting than crafting, but still has that build->use->build cycle you're looking for.

Takes a bit before it becomes non-generic. Might be worth skipping to around chapter 50ish once you've read the first couple.

IE Muggles act tactically, and Wizards aren't so bumbling as to ignore the 'firelegs' pointed at them?

** Any good Harry in Slytherin fanfics?

Recently binged Prince of Slytherin from last week's recommendations ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/2/]] skip the prologue, it spoils things and author is planning on going back and heavily editing/removing it. I linked to the first actual chapter) and I loved it, easily top 5 HP fanfics for me.

*** Started reading Prince of Slytherin based on the same recommendation and... I can't stand it. It's absolutely full of bashing, James and Jr are absolute dicks, the novel is good at making you sympathize with Harry because the premise of the story (apart from the Peter part) cannot happen without everybody being an inconsiderate asshole.

I must admit I haven't read a lot, having just finished chapter 8 but if the whole novel is going to be "Jim is an idiot and everybody loves Harry, who becomes a perfect Pureblood over Summer" I don't know how it is so liked, it reminds me of the worst fanon of Worm, with the Trio being Jack Slash Jr and woobie Panacea and Undersiders. Does it have any redeemable qualities, does it get better? I mean, I assume it must get somewhat better, but is it worth getting to that point?

.....

Not sure if it will suit your tastes, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23747950/chapters/57035011#main][The Good War]] in AO3 is a delightful Slytherin!Fem!Harry story that goes deep in the consequences of the Dudley's abuse on Harry (here Elizabeth). Here we have an independent and distrustful protagonist that has to relearn how to live when not surrounded by hate.

Sadly, the story doesn't have many chapters, and each new chapter takes a while. There's also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shedding-lionskin-harry-potter-au.862342/#post-68309077][Shedding Lionskin]] from BeaconHill, the author of "Nemesis" (The Bumblebee worm fanfic). Harry is a metamorphmagus and at the end of book 4 (I think) decides to pretend to leave Hogwarts and attend classes as a woman in Slytherin. Makes more sense in context.

I think both of this have been recommended earlier, so they should somewhat fit rational themes even if they are not rational themselves.

**** If you're willing, I'd recommend reading chapters [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/29/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][29]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/30/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][30]], since I think those are where the story really picks up.

With that said, I do agree with a lot of your criticisms. While the bashing lessens/get contextualized (eg. there are legit, if flawed, reasons Harry was left at the Dursleys), it remains to some extent. While the whole "Harry is always right and Jim is always a loser" lessens, there is a sort of undercurrent of competence surrounding Harry, and Jim kind of gets shit on by the narrative.

Ultimately, the political nature (like, actual politics, not just 11-year-old Slytherins) and the worldbuilding kept me reading.

***** On your recommendation and of others I jumped ahead to chapter 29 and stopped by the end of book 1 (chapter 34).I admit it explains some things and gets better, but I'm not sure if I can manage to go back to chapter 8 and get to that point. Maybe I'll just skip those chapters. Also, those explanations haven't really been foreshadowed (ok, maybe some), and sometimes look like the author has taken them out of his ass to justify what has happened.

Anyway, to those discorauged by my review, reading ahead things get kinda better. Nothing particularly impressive, at least in my point of view, and definitely nothing that makes the first ten or so chapters worth it.

Thanks to those that have taken the time to reply to my comment, if I continue reading is y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶ thanks to you.

**** Yes, the first arc is cliché and trope--heavy on purpose. The author's deliberate intention is to fully deconstruct a stereotypical WBWL story, and over the next ~1m words it gradually recontextualizes and overthrows everything that happened before with a massive, complex storyline full of twists and turns (for a fanfiction, anyway). That is not to say that PoS is perfect---it gets bloated after a while, and the overall narrative becomes kinda depressing and hopeless, with some very high-level, esoteric conflicts. It's /very/ ambitious in what it's trying to do, and while that often results in some amazing scenes and ideas, it also sometimes becomes it's own trapping. And the bashing... over time you learn so much about internal motivations of all characters that you genuinely feel more of a pity or sympathy at them, rather than anger. Most of them get really fleshed out, and if not redeemed, then at the very least made clearly understandable in why they are acting the way they do. At the current moment, only a single character could arguably be said to be still bashed, but it's less 'What an asshole! How could such a cruel person exist?' thing and more 'Dude, what a sad, miserable person trapped in an awful situation' thing. If you don't have patience for long build-ups and a lot of subtle foreshadowing and shit, while everyone talks about politicking and generic indy!Harry tropes appear in the foreground, then reading it will be pretty painful, though. I would still say it's worth it for the crazy AU worldbuilding and insane plot twists, but eh. YMMV.

From my perspective, the story seems controversial in a pretty similar way to how HPMOR is controversial, if that tells you anything.

  This is easily one of the best Slytherin Harry fanfiction out there. The premise is if the sorting hat put sorted Harry into Slytherin. It follows a realistic trajectory from that outcome.
