/EDIT: found it! check the comments below for mentions of and links to Attribution Errors, an entire family of this sort of cognitive bias./

So I've just realized one of my own biases, and I'm wondering ignore anyone else has noticed it in fiction. I will use the Star Trek and Star Wars fandoms as an example, but obviously it occurs elsewhere.

Ben is a Star Wars fan, and he hates the original Star Trek because of its styrofoam rocks and wooden acting. He's tried to watch a Star Trek film, but found it boring and pointless. He has a Trekkie friend named Jim, and they can't get into a civil conversation about either of their favorite space fictions without an argument.

Thesis: Ben sees only the good things about his favorite movies and only the bad things about what his friend watches; thus, Ben /assumes/ Jim likes Star Trek /because/ of the very things Ben hates about it, the things that trigger his ire.

Ben does not realize that Jim may dislike some or all of the same things about Star Trek, but Jim ignores his dislike because he's caught up in the characters, creatures, cultures, social commentary, et cetera.

And the same thing happens when Jim watches the Star Wars films; he believes them to be adventure serials for children, with cheesy writing, predictable twists, and Ewoks. He thinks Ben is wasting his time on a single galactic government that fell to tyranny unrealistically fast and was magically restored when its leadership got blowed up real good.

Both see flaws in what the other likes or wants and wrongly sees those flaws as the other's reasons for liking it. Both are willing to defend or explain away the flaws they themselves see in what they like or want, to protect their real reasons for liking it.

Obviously, this applies to religion and politics as well.

So far in typing this up, I see inadvertent strawman, failure of perspective taking, and ignoring flaws in one's own. Anything else? And does anyone know of a rational story where this bias exists and is confronted, aside from how HPMOR!Harry tries to treat Draco's ideas and feelings about Muggles.

*** Thanks, these are exactly it! I hadn't realized that field of study was so rich with fodder for stories. As a person with Asperger Syndrome, most of my stories have characters with no attribution biases. In the future, all of my OCs will have at least two attribution errors in my worldbuilding notes.

**** You're welcome. I'm curious why you think your stories lack attribution bias and how that relates to your Asperger's. Do you mean that your characters all understand each other perfectly or that they lack the theory of mind (commonly missing in ASD) necessary to take other perspectives?

** /"Do not do unto others as you would have that they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same."/

Character/Reader values dissonance is a veritable hydra of plot twists, usually in the form of a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise][Tomato Surprise]]. Protagonist isn't quite so righteous as we assumed, nor Antagonist so unforgivable... but I don't think that's really what you're talking about.

The problem isn't that Ben and Jim are blind to anything but the flaws of what the other loves, it's that they fundamentally disagree about what's enjoyable. Jim is never going to find any classic science fiction dilemmas and moral quandaries in Star Wars. Ben is never going to find any Flash Gordon space opera in Star Trek. Neither belongs in the other.

Worse yet, believing that Jim loves styrofoam rocks and wooden acting or that Ben loves cheesy lines and predictable twists is /not wrong/. Each adores these failings of their beloved works precisely because they had to overcome the silliness of them. When either franchise manages to successfully incorporate the best parts of the other without losing their fundamental character, both sides rejoice.

But that's rare, and actually really hard to do. The benefits works at cross purposes: Star Wars speeds up as Star Trek slows down.

Getting both Jim and Ben at a table together and explaining that their tastes differ will not change those tastes. If the stakes are higher than which silly popular science fiction universe one prefers, it won't even make them less angry. In religion and politics the argument may superficially be about beliefs, but ultimately it's about actions... often ones taken long enough ago that great damage has already been done. Yeah great, Jim's not actually some stupid, insane monster. He's still defending a long line of stupid, insane, monstrous decisions.

So yeah, sometimes a fictional Jim comes to understand a fictional Ben and learns to love his style of goofy fun, but rarely in a realistic way. Values are slow to change, if they can be changed at all.

*** this reminds me of the 'bad wrong fun' argument from RPGs (usualy game mechanics vs RP). how dare those people have fun in a way different than you have fun?

even if you can understand the argument of the other side, that does not solve the problem at all. if the guy on the other side hates you for having a different opinion, then understanding why does not help in the slightest. they will often simply double-down on how they hate you for having a different opinion (be it politics, religion, or how you enjoy playing RPGs differently).

so the problem becomes that some people have strong opinions, and hate those who disagree with them. they put the blame for this on the other people, and are not open to debate (and debate may be seen as a challenge or threat). a subset of this are people who Must Be Right, so anyone who disagrees with them is Wrong.

I've always thought there was something more going on there. It's not really that role-players are offended that gamers enjoy gaming, or vice-versa; the problem they have is that they're both calling the thing they like by one name ("playing an RPG"), such that it can lead to an expectation that a given RPG session will contain the thing you like---or a given /person/ will /like/ the thing you like---but then it turns out that they like something you /don't enjoy at all/ but which just happens to be equated to it in virtually all circumstances.

If you dissolve the concept of "role-playing game", the competing-access-needs that are going on here become quite stark. Everyone wants to invite their friends to get into doing /the particular thing that they themselves like doing/. Inviting your friends to get into that, and seeing them end up getting into something /totally different/ while claiming that they're "doing the thing you like with you," is decidedly suboptimal. (But, of course, then /they/ want to get /you/ into the part of the activity that /they're/ enjoying...)

Compare and contrast: love languages.

But of course we, the ingroup, only do this because of circumstances such as forgetting our biases in the heat of argument. They, the outgroup, do it because they're sloppy thinkers. .... the Ultimate Attribution Error wins again.
