After seeing this recommended I decided to give it a go. I... have mixed feelings about it.

Pros:

- There's a bigger meta-story going on, which is good. The plot was definitely enough to hook me and keep me curious as to where it's going.

- The base story was pretty good too. I very much liked the world building - not only in Isis, but on AU-Earth as well. The backstory with Jackson and Charles was ghoulishly delightful.

- Since there's a game interface overlaying many characters, that means you get a bit of consistency with the rules of the world. Jackson frequently would go on tangents about how many stat points equals whatever outcome, which was nice and rational.

- I liked a lot of the characters, even if many were tropes. There was some pretty good banter, and while many background characters tended to blend together, the main characters are pretty well developed. Rachel's personality especially was hilarious, and Shaka played a great teacher/mother figure.

Cons:

- Pacing issues galore. Things progress fairly slowly, and then you get to the final chapter and Jackson suddenly gets a huge power-up (literally more than octupling his damage output). He was already Marty Stuesque but just goes full-on shonen protagonist by the end.

- The sex scenes felt out of place. They were fairly well done, but for being on "literotica," I think only three of the ten chapters had sex scenes at all. The author warned of that from the beginning but it still felt kind of out of place. Especially with Chaki and Jackson. Awkward, people-hating Jackson becomes an amateur PUA for all of like... half a chapter. Then their relationship mostly goes back to mostly chaste and somewhat awkward. Worst of all, they go with the trope of "oh, you saved me from being raped, now let's have sex instead!" Ugh.

- I felt like the author switched his mind about a lot of stuff mid-stream, or was making it up as he goes along. Jackson starts as a videogame junkie who earned a bunch of winnings in VR games, but then a few chapters later it comes out that he's actually a brilliant modder who crafts prosthetic legs that revolutionized the medical world. It talks about the 20k he made early on as being impressive winnings, but he had been given a 500k salary for a job he took two years previously (granted, only for a few months, but still). And the entire hook about Ron and his sister never gets brought up again.

- A lot of the characters are just one-dimensional. Boonta is the moody and entitled son of the chief - curse his sudden but inevitable betrayal! Hale is just straight-up evil. Most of the side-characters in the tribe blend together, especially the other apprentices and the chiefs.

- The female characters all seem to exist just to be damsels in distress for the male characters to rescue. Jackson saves Chaki - she falls in love with him. Jackson saves Rachel - she falls in love with him. Charles treats his android assistant with respect - she falls in love with him. Charles saves Princess WhateverHerNameIs - I can take a guess where this is going. Yes, sometimes the girls are awesome too, but they're forever getting forced into corners and saved by the men.

- Probably the worst part is that the last chapter came out in 2015, and it looks like nothing's been released since then. The writing got better as the author got further along, but now it's been dead for 2+ years. I would have loved to see more of the plot expanded, or to find out what'll come next, but it seems like it might not happen for a while, if ever.

Edit: Overall rating, I'd give it a maybe a 6.5/10. The plot was good, but there were a ton of smaller issues. The writing quality started off quite average, but improved a bit as time went on.
