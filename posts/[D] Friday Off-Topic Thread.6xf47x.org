Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** No spoilers, but I found the most recent season of /Game of Thrones/ to be a real let-down, mostly because the show's persistent problems with accurately depicting travel times have come to a head. One of the directors has admitted that [[http://news.avclub.com/game-of-thrones-director-admits-the-show-s-timeline-is-1798346260][they're focusing on the emotional experience]] (spoilers in link) and fudging the timeline to make things work, hoping that no one will notice.

I've gotten into a lot of arguments with people, mostly friends-of-friends on Facebook. There's not much that hits my nerd rage button harder than "it's got dragons, why would anyone think it was going to be realistic". The other argument I've heard a lot is "nerds just want a show where nothing happens for the sake of realism", which is obviously not the case. It's that I don't want things to happen in defiance of logic and the established rules because the writer couldn't make the plot work within the universe that they established.

(I am almost certainly preaching to the choir here.)

**** Well, the real problem is that the writers don't actually /care,/ nor does GRRM himself (he's quoted as saying that you should put down the ruler and stopwatch and just enjoy the story). That takes a story that's generally pretty grounded and pulls the rug out from under it, because now it's not that the army starves because their supply lines are cut and they need too much food on a forced march, it's that Plot Demands It Be So. And once that's the case, the writers are no longer thinking about what it means to travel for months on end with someone, or the pressures of half rations, or the movements of fleets, they're instead focused on what best manipulates the emotions of the audience.

It's not just the penultimate episode of the season that's at fault, it's most of the others as well. Troop and fleet movements don't make sense, they just /happen/ because the writers needed some drama. All the logistics gets filled in after the fact to make the plot work (which was basically what Star Trek did with their technobabble).

The show (and to a lesser extent, the books) was never good about any of this, but now that the plotlines have converged it's harder to hide behind "these things aren't happening at the same time", mostly because they /are/ happening at the same time.

Also, fudging the timelines for the sake of fast pacing might work on an earlier season, in different circumstances, but here there are several major plot points that would obviously be impossible if the writers didn't cheat with time:

****** Yes, this is all troubling. It reeks of dues ex machina. I think that they should have made an rpg for the directors and writers, and just let it flow, with grrm as the guide. Why does the story have to have a plan? Break the chains of the narrative. More then the logistics, i felt the activitoes of the charecters this last season was almost vulgar in the way it didn't feel authentic. The interaction between baelish, arya and sansa? I felt it was goofy. Other things for me that felt wrong was the imps acting around danaerys, and cersei losing a lot of her poise.\\
To me all of the performers lost something, to an extent, and I think before they had a sense of purpose and were able to merge with their charecters. Now, i think they instead are being directed as what to feel.

***** I don't remember it being an issue for me in the books, mainly because it wasn't used for any singular parties benefit or loss, and also most of the characters are privledged so it would ignore much of the plebian problems, which I guess I expected. I think what got me more then the logistics is the ice guy that threw that lance...that broke my heart because it was so forced. What this season really did for me that caused the biggest dissapointment, is that I am no longer emmersed at a micro level, enjoying each charecter, each interaction.

Also, we don't have the manuscript ourselves, so before we could see what was skipped and not feel as though we missed something. What defined Game of Thrones for me was its unapologetic honesty, I never once felt the author cared about me, or the charecters. No favorites, almost as though they were independent entities, and we were allowed to judge ourselves. Now, i feel that the charecters suddenly lost that independence, and are trapped in a predetermined plot? I can blather on forever on and on, as I love the premise...i truly hope it is just a fluke, and that the next season is more of before.

It was never "this happened because the charecters are emotional" it was more that the charecters are human, therefore their emotions influence the decision.

** I recently started watching Rick and Morty for the first time and, for the most part, I like it. I laugh at pretty much all the jokes, the stories parody interesting sci-fi ideas, and the animation is always imaginative. The only issue I've had with it, though it's become much less of a problem in season 2, is that when it tries to be taken seriously I can't ignore what objectively horrible people all the characters are.

I get the impression that the series overarching theme is nihilism. Rick has seen into infinity and found terrible things happening to everyone for no reason, including alternate versions of himself, and decided nothing really matters so there was no point in caring about anything. It's my interpretation that he goes on all these insane adventures to distract himself from that knowledge.

That makes for some hilarious dark comedy, but whenever it does something serious I just feel depressed and that's not what I want from this show. The first episode where they just watch interdimensional TV to escape from existential dread may be my least favorite episode so far because it undercuts the escapism I'm looking for. I legitimately lost sleep over the scene where Morty was almost raped.

To be clear, I like literally everything else about the show except the drama. It's just when it comes back to elements like Morty's dysfunctional family that it loses me because they're all morons and assholes. His parents are incapable of resolving the problems their family has, so whenever the show focuses on that for something other than comedy I feel dissatisfied. I've made it as far as the car battery episode.

My only regret is that I picked up Rick and Morty just after I started JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, so I fully expect for my brain to melt from the amount of illogical absurdity I'm putting into it at once. I'm a couple episodes into Battle Tendency, Joseph has just left for Mexico, and the series continues to get more hilariously over the top with every episode. I can't wait to see more insane fighting moves like the multi-grenade trick.

**** I do like that Morty has had some subtle character development with standing up to Rick and actually following through on the morals he preaches. The turning point for me was the climax from the episode with the Council of Ricks where he organized all the Mortys and decided to save Rick because he believed it was the right thing to do even if he had nothing to gain from it.

To me, that showed that he wouldn't give into the hedonistic nihilism that Rick has. After abandoning their home universe and taking over the lives of alternates who died purely by coincidence, I was worried he would give in to Rick's worldview. Instead, he has proven that he'll stand up for values that he believes in at a personal cost and own up to the harm he causes.

Rick so far has been unwilling to change, but I think this season is building up to some actual character development. The drama has gotten darker and more intense, but in turn I think there is hope for Rick and his family. So if the drama (and resulting disruption to the escapism) is too much for you, yeah season 3 isn't going to be your thing, but i think there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

*** I don't agree with the others that the characters are "progressing" over the different seasons, especially not "progressing for the better".

They're changing, they're exploring new situations, sometimes they react differently, but they've mostly stayed the same on average since day 1. The only consistent change I've seen is Morty becoming gradually more jaded, more violent, and more willing to hurt and manipulate people for his own ends. That's... I mean, that's valid character development, but it's pretty ugly and sad.

Honestly, I feel like the show is written by people with different, probably incompatible moral outlooks with different conclusions about who Rick is and what he's worth. At the end of "Pick Rick", the therapist calls him out on using his intellect to justify hurting his family. At the end of "Vindicators", they let the villain get away, Rick goes "whatever, I never suffer from lasting negative consequences for my choices anyway", and Morty discards his dominator shirt like he's learned an important lesson when Rick /murdered his childhood heroes/.

I don't know. One the one hand, the show is clearly written by people who know what abusive behavior looks like, and it /is/ self-aware about the hypocrisy sometimes, but it... never really addresses it? The therapist episode is the closest it went to that. Honestly, it'd have been fine if the episode ended with the family in the car, after the therapist speech; but then we have a post-credit scene where Rick is awesome again, and says "That is the reason I don't go to therapy", and it feels like the whole episode was for nothing.

Rick gets his way too often is what I'm saying.

**** I agree, but I have trouble accusing the show of not delivering on what it's always promised. Rick has always been a belligerent asshole that hurts everyone around him and gets what he wants anyway because he's so narratively powerful that nothing can seriously threaten him. His family has always been unusually accepting of this without trying to rationalize it because they are all kind of crazy and pretty stupid.

This set up was engaging because it acted as a vehicle for dark comedy and imaginative adventures. It's to sci-fi what Archer was to James Bond. I eventually stopped watching Archer, but I was always more of a fan of the sardonic wit than the raunchy humor so when the latter took more prominence I wasn't enjoying myself anymore. For me, Rick and Morty hasn't stopped being entertaining in the ways it was before.

I don't see how these are incompatible. Both episodes show Rick as a horrible human being. The Vindicators were also terrible people and that episode ruined Morty's faith in them. IIRC the Vindicators largely killed themselves by deciding to argue instead of scoring points when failing to score points activated the death trap. Morty already knew Rick was an asshole throughout the episode and lost more trust in him when he got the Noot-Noot video.

Rick gets his way often because the Rick & Morty universe has no karmic justice. It is cynical and emotionally realistic. Rick didn't have a sudden character changing revelation from the therapist's speech because that kind of thing rarely happens in real life. In real life if you made someone with narcissism go to a therapist and listen to a lecture on their faults that person would likely react the same way that Rick did.

***** I see your point, but I think describing the show as "realistic" is utterly the wrong point to make. Even if Rick's behavior does reflect a real-world occurrence, that doesn't make the show more enjoyable to watch. It would also be realistic for Rick to die of liver problems due to his alcoholism or just be too inebriated to defend himself, but that's not what the audience or creators want to happen so it doesn't.

****** I qualified by saying emotionally realistic. You obviously can't call it realistic as a whole when guy turns himself into a pickle ninja to get out of therapy. Rick probably replaces his liver semi-regularly, has a robotic replacement or fixes the damage with nanobots. (though Ricks presumably die a lot in other timelines just not the one we are following because Ricks seems to have a poor self-preservation instinct in general)

Part of the thematic elements of Rick & Morty is that it doesn't pull punches. Making bad things happen to bad people to satisfy viewers sense of justice goes entirely against the thematic underpinnings of the show. The universe has no sense of justice, religions are arbitrary and misguided, you need to take control of your own destiny.

--------------

Hoo boy.  It feels like a crap ton of coding work was done this week, even though some of it turned out to be burned up on designs that didn't work out, but such is life.

Last week, I was in the middle of getting stats to a working point, and I think at this point the building blocks are conclusively finished, barring bugfixes and potential optimizations.  There is a Stat object for each numeric type in C# (ByteStat, IntStat, FloatStat and so on), and all of them can be used with each other and the primitive numeric types in calculations.

For instance, if I instantiate an IntStat x, I can manipulate it by doing

   x += 10;

instead of doing

   x.Set(x.Value + 10);

This is definitely worth the effort that it took to get the code templates right.  Oh, and final count resulted in three code templates, one each for the stats, tests, and benchmarks.  The stat template is 228 lines and expands to 11,623 lines (roughly 1,000 lines per stat); the benchmark is a modest 110 lines that unfolds to 1,858, and the tests template is 142 lines that balloons to 16,929 lines.  

Unit testing is actually a very legitimate application of the code templates.  Usually my patience wears pretty thin in writing repetitive tests that cover ever more edge cases, but in cases like this where there's a systematic, repetitive test space?  I can brute force it!  Within the tests are a function for each combination of every stat, primitive, and mathematical operator.  FloatStat_Add_Float, FloatStat_Add_FloatStat, FloatStat_Add_Int, FloatStat_Add_IntStat, and so on, resulting in 1,936 tests spanning all of the possible applications of this code.  And it's useful!  As I tweaked and refactored things over the weekend, I frequently broke huge swathes of tests with small changes; it was useful to see both the scope of the damage (“hmm, 250 tests are failing, and they're all related to X”), but also the validation that they /all/ pass again once I fix the bug.  

The benchmarks were intended for use mostly to compare the performance of these base numeric stats and what I was calling a HybridStat, which was essentially a fixed-point long integer.  [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ptSlwYGYw6vecrw3PEFks0pDf1Vkhv8Yy8ZbsDJcKyU/edit?usp=sharing][The results are listed here]], showing somewhere around a 150x slowdown when using the stat objects in math compared to just using the primitive they are based on.  Considering that this boils down to performing 6.25 million math operations in a second as opposed to 2 billion, I think it's acceptable, especially since most uses of the operators are going to be mostly one-offs done during modded move calculations, which is going to be dwarfed by other aspects of moves.

Anyway, the HybridStat was eventually pointed out to me to be more trouble than it's worth.  Essentially, rather than doing so much work having a long act like a float without the associated floating point errors that come along with it (and still act like an integer while still including even division), it was pointed out that we can abandon the assumption of “1 move use = 1 EV” and bump that up to “1 move use = 1000 EVs” and it essentially fixes the problem.  Considering that it's mostly a behind-the-scenes change, I think it's acceptable.

([[http://i.imgur.com/a75oeKS.png][But I had had]] so much [[http://i.imgur.com/lB356fs.png][success optimizing it!]] A shame.)

--------------

With stats in place, I started working on Species/Creature/Unit, which are more associated with Renegade than they are XGEF, so it's been the first real use of the System/Mod split.  As a result, I've had to start fleshing out the JSON serializer (a tool that converts in-code objects to JSON and back) and figure out exactly how assets are loaded.  

Currently I'm leaning towards a two-sided approach when it comes to requesting assets.  First, various Loaders are instantiated at the start of the game that report on what files are available (a DiskLoader checks the physical disk for files in the right place, a NetworkLoader calls a website API and gets a list of files, etc etc).  These registered files are then translated to a purely relative virtual file structure index: for instance, a system might request information on the Charizard species by requesting “core/units/Charizard.pkmn”, while another might ask for “core/items/potion.item”.  

Mods and game code doesn't have to worry about the fact that Charizard is located at C:/Documents and Settings/ketura/Documents/test/Renegade/data/core/units/Charizard.pkmn, nor does it have to worry about Potion being at [[http://www.pokefan.com/RenegadeFilesMirror/CoolItemMod?request=core%2Fitems%2Fpotion.item.json&version=1.2]] . All they do is request the simple relative file, and then the AssetIndex looks up what loader registered the file and tells it to cough it up.  

So that's one side.  The other is permitting Loaders to register entire empty folders, which can allow for arbitrary “file” data.  For instance, perhaps someone decides to make an infinite world mod (Renegade will be fixed-size).  They can have a MapLoader register the “core/map” folder entirely, so when some system requests information on “core/map/x10y32z40.chunk”, the MapLoader is asked to “load” this file, which in reality is actually generating the chunk on the fly.

Between these two applications, I think that everything asset-related will be covered. We'll see how it goes over the next week or so.

--------------

Oh, and I've fixed an oversight:  The XGEF repository was still private, [[https://bitbucket.org/ketura/xgef/overview][which I have now fixed]].  Feel free to poke around it if you're technically inclined, just be aware that I occasionally commit broken code (as I did last night) and that organization frequently changes on a whim.

*** IIRC you're intending for this to be an engine that can be repurposed toward other games as well when you're done. Am I remembering correctly?

If so, will art creation be necessary or will it be possible to run a text-only game on the engine?

**** Yes, the hope is that once I've washed my hands of Renegade I can take the bulk of XGEF with me, and I'm building it accordingly.

Text only games should be quite doable, and in fact the first several iterations of combat will be command line before I futz about with visuals. The idea is to keep the "server" and "client" as separate from one another as possible, so how the client renders the window ought to be mostly immaterial to the server. There will be a handful of soft exceptions (such as defining GUI elements), but for the most part the server (and XGEF in general) will be mostly hands-off in that regard.

***** Nice. Have you decided what kind of license will be applied to the engine? I didn't see anything about that, but I'm on a phone so I might just be overlooking it.

(If not, then I recommend something at least as stringent as Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, so people know where the engine came from and have to "pay it forward." It's what I use for a lot of my work.)

****** Engines (and code in general) are a bit interesting when it comes to licensing. On the one hand, yes, credit for my work is nice. On the other hand, you don't put up a billboard in front of your house saying BUILT USING DEWALT POWER TOOLS, and it's a very similar thing.

At the end of the day, a share-alike license (such as the GPL v3) tends to have a stigma of being "infectious"...if you use the GPL code in your project, now the rest of your project is forced to be GPL, which usually precludes being able to successfully commercialize the program, and I don't want that (neither for myself nor others).

I will probably end up using the MIT license as I have done for the majority of the code I have worked on for side projects. It's basically as loose a restriction as one can get without actually releasing it into the public domain: use it, remix it, sell it, whatever, just don't call it yours when it ain't.

EDIT: oh, and thanks for the reminder. I'll put up licensing and a Readme later tonight.

********** After chewing on this for a couple days, I think I'm going to stick with MIT. I mean, I highly doubt that this is going to end up used in any huge capacity by anyone but me, and if the number and type of arguments I've had concerning its design are any indication, it's not going to be super popular with other programmers (doesn't help that I'm not S-class in coding either). But in the event that someone comes along and loves it just enough to make a private fork, then more power to them. They're probably going to change a bunch of shit I don't like, so who cares if they don't rerelease it?

But putting aside the likely outcome, worst case as pertains to licensing is that EA or someone comes along and likes what I've built, so they take it, build on it, and use it in Battlefield40k or whatever and never release the modifications they made. I don't really get fanfare for writing a crucial portion of a AAA game, and they never have to give back nor put in the man hours to build it from scratch. This is the same practical result that would happen with just about any other open source licensing, too; what, am I going to sue them for violating the GPL? Would make a great story but not one I'd like to experience.

Plus, with MIT I can always change my mind later on, but once I've used a GPL variant I'm pretty well stuck with it.

*********** I disagree with but strongly support this decision - it's your project and you can use whatever license you want to :)

Final notes:

- If you switch from MIT to (L)GPL, you still have to retain the text of the MIT license unless all copyright holders agree (ie all contributors, if any)
- You can trivially switch from (L)GPL to MIT or any other license - including none at all - with the agreement of all copyright holders.
- I would use the Apache License over MIT - they're basically identical except for patent clauses. (because the MIT license was written before software could be patented in the USA, a terrible decision with appalling consequences)

************ Hrrm, I hadn't considered the patent angle (I'd mostly been ruminating over copyleft vs permissive). After wikiwalking for a bit, I can see the potential importance of needing to avoid situations where some random pull request results in a patent issue, especially considering Renegade's subject matter. I still don't think it's /likely/ to be an issue, but when the cost of prevention is changing what bytes I stick in a license file, it'd be irresponsible not to. I'll go with Apache.

(Shame that the thing is like ten times longer and harder to read than MIT, tho. I do appreciate brevity over legalese.)

I didn't know about the changing license thing, but that makes sense upon reflection. Thanks for all the input! Learned lots of good info due to your posting.

**** This was horribly frustrating for me as well, believe you me (tho I guess I discovered t4 as a result, so we'll call it a wash). Basically, in c# generics are as strongly typed as possible, and since there's no constraint that you can put on T to indicate "this is a primitive numeric", you can't do things like add two Ts together, or perform any math at all within the Stat<T> class, or even so much as cast to other numeric types or other Stat<T>s, since the compiler has no way of knowing at compile time that T will always have those functions.

I /could/ have just left it at Stat<T>, but I didn't like the idea of all stat math needing to operate on MyStat.Value instead of just MyStat. I wanted the implicit casting where it made sense, and I also wanted to overload the mathematical operators, but since I can't do math on a T, well...the only other option was a hard coded IntStat etc.

(Or wrappers, but that just pushes the exact same issue one level deeper in the abstraction.)

Fortunately since it's all generated from a single code template, I don't have to /maintain/ 11 different instances of this freakshow class, merely the one metaprogram.

And I REALLY want to do something with My Werewolves, because I don't think there's a take quite like them).

I'm trying to work out a plot, so we'll see how we go. Got two main characters (the story may only end up being about one), but I need to work out a conflict that happens. It'll probably be a social conflict. Anyone have any resources for that sort of thing? I'm hoping to write this as rational from the ground up, so especially any (preferably short) rational stories that include social conflict/issues/etc as a central issue.
