Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** In case anyone was eagerly awaiting the release of my rational vampire romance novel, although the first volume is 95% finished, I won't be posting it for several months at least.

My coauthor, who needs to sprinkle the last 5%'s worth of fairy dust on it, is swamped for time so she's not going to be able to do the final pass of editing for a while. And without that extra 5% I don't feel like the story is ready for general consumption.

Due to the spotlight effect, I have a completely unfounded impression that people are wondering what's taking so long for me to release the story that has been the subject of many a worldbuilding post, and that's putting a tiny mote of stress on me, so I'm going to "come clean" and that way I won't feel that tiny mote of stress.

If anyone was truly chomping at the bit to read my gay supernatural romance story and are willing to give feedback, feel free to PM me and I'll link you the 95%-complete first volume (approx 50k words).

In other news, I'm beginning to sketch out the second volume. I know how it begins and how it ends, but the getting there is going to be fun to work out.

** In LitRPGs, and some video games, Chess often features as a convenient way to level up intelligence or a strategy skill. [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][The Wandering Inn]] features this prominently and to good effect. However, I wonder how far the real life analogy goes? Do chessmasters tend to achieve more in science and mathematics as the result of their training? Do they become better entrepreneurs who can outmaneuver their opponents? Or is it just one of many niche skills of primarily entertainment value?

*** Chess is kind of a silly way to measure general intelligence. After all, computers can play chess better than humans, and they don't have general intelligence (that we know of).

In practice, chess doesn't capture a major part of human vs human battles: deception. Chess has no real deception, the board is completely honest to both sides, both players can see every piece on the board and their locations. Which means things like reading the enemy, or skills to prevent yourself from being read? Not used in chess. (I mean, yes, you can hide your intentions for each move, but your intentions don't really mean anything. A skilled opponent would read the board for all possible ways for each move to benefit you, not just the ones you intended.)

So in real life, where most modern battles (even economic battles) rely on misinformation and subterfuge? Chess is a really poor choice for "leveling up" your strategy skills.

**** Good point. While I doubt that chess improves intelligence or strategic skills, it's near certain that there will be notable differences in intellectual ability between people who are able and people who are /unable/ to play chess. It's easy to see how people could have historically mistaken cause and effect, believing that simply playing chess makes a significant impact in cognitive abilities.

More than anything else, I think the greatest potential for improvements in cognitive function would come from applied realistic multi-disciplinary problem-solving. That would guide learners towards generalized and real-world applicable problem-solving skills.

**** Even in a much simpler level: it seems like things like the increased memory for board positions is highly specialized, and chess masters stop doing as well when the pieces are randomized.

So, at the first hurdle, there's a problem.

** If this unrelated I'll delete it and post it Friday. I was thinking about how to go from reading a book and taking notes to a wiki type format. At some point I started to think about a tagging system for an ebook. As you read something you tag relevant snippets to key words. Such as Location or technique/skill/spell. The tags could be further divided into description and, uses/events there.

Have y'all heard of a program that provides this function or a similar function while browsing a text?

*** Convert the ebook into a .doc file or something similar, upload that to a TinyWiki, then go from there? It isn't exactly what you're looking for, but closer than anything else I can think of.

** How is "Not this time, Fate" by Coeur Al'Aran? Would you say it's on par with TGWP?
