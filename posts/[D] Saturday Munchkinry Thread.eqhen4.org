Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Ok. How about a character with a temperature changing effect area? They force a small volume of space to maintain a constant, room temperature condition.

*** Extremely useful for power generation. Power plants rely on the difference between a hot and cold area to generate power from a fuel source. If you can force a location to maintain a constant temperature, the power plant doesn't need to radiate the heat into the environment, and the amount of power generated goes up as well since the heat sink temperature would normally be above room temperature.

Alternatively, very useful on the ISS, because dissipating heat is a non-trivial problem. Removing the need for a lot of the cooling would mean that it doesn't need to be resupplied with the ammonia coolant that's used to dissipate heat.

Data centers spend a lot of money on cooling their servers. If the air could be circulated through the area you're keeping at a constant temperature, you could save a ton of money on electricity.

**** Even better, you could directly generate power in places like Antarctica where the environment is colder than room temperature.

*** Pretty handy in Antarctica or Death Valley, though obviously there are relatively simple workarounds both cases (like wearing appropriate clothing).

Using this ability on ice could be interesting. You could de-ice an airplanes' control surfaces, engines and sensors. You could tunnel through an ice shelf if you had a pump to get rid of the water. You could clear snow and ice off of your car with remarkable ease.

This ability could be handy when using a paintball gun or other compressed air gun. Normally, the temperature of the compressed gas drops with decreases in pressure, and lowered temperature adds to your loss of pressure. As such, rapid fire with a paintball gun will result in more rapid decrease in muzzle velocity than you'd get with slow, intermittent firing. Using this ability, you could disregard that problem and fire as fast as you like.

This is extremely handy if you'd like to be able to perform maintenance on the furnace of a coal power plant without interrupting operation, though in most cases you could simply shut down temporarily during off hours while other plants or generators pick up the slack.

Incredibly handy for a firefighter. It's no guarantee against building collapse, and you'd still need a reliable oxygen source, but basically you could shut down the fires everywhere you go by bringing the fuel and air to sub-combustion temperatures and then dousing everything in water to keep it from re-igniting.

Grants immunity to lasers and flamethrowers, so could have some significant combat applications. There's certainly things that can be done to reduce susceptibility to lasers and flamethrowers, but this is definitely beyond any kind of defense that other approaches could offer.

On that note... this stops combustion engines. You could use it to stop a car. If it has significant range, it could be used to shut down engines on an aircraft.

This ability could also disable guns. You won't stop the percussion cap from going off, so there might be a click/pop sound, but the powder could be prevented from igniting.

Oh, uh, one other thing: This ability can literally kill people. Instantly drop their body temperature to room temperature and they'll die of hypothermia.

Put the tunnel at a slope, and you don't even need the pump.

*** It's basically a cooling power, since heating things is to room temperature is easy. Does it matter what's in the effect area? It's more effective if they can aim it at a thermal conductor, like a chunk of a copper heat sink.

Room temperature is ideal for computing, but data centers already achieve this (at great expense, but they get there). On the other hand, the efficiency of a thermal engine is limited by the ratio between its cold end and hot end, and in power generation the cold end tends to still be hundreds of degrees. Cooling some strategically placed lump of copper in a power plant would probably be the best use of the power.

*** Is there a defined "room temperature"? Local average right now? Over some period of time? Is the sampled range the same as the area of effect? If someone starts lights some thermite inside that range, can the whole area be burned? If there's a tank of liquid nitrogen, can the whole area be frozen solid?

Moving a person's whole body to room temperature would probably kill the person, and I don't think there'd be any sign of death.

*** Generate energy by providing heat energy to reactants in an endothermic reaction, storing the energy as chemical potential energy and removing it from the zone. This can be used to directly produce fuel.

Alternatively, activate power in a container of cool gas; use the expanding gas to drive a piston, then deactivate the power to allow the heat energy to disperse and piston to retract.

This is assuming 1) you can't just blow cool air through the zone and have it come out the other end warm, i.e. the heat energy itself is restricted somehow, 2) this power pulls energy from somewhere normally inaccessible.

Also calculate things by heating specific monitored fluids in massive fluid container arrays as extremely rapid input, or heating specific places as instructed by a computer in a carefully monitored fluid container, for a computer based on calculating/ observing fluid dynamics.

** You could probably do some impossible things with chemistry.

What if you took a lump of molten metal and forced it to be room temperature? It wouldn't cool as its molecules bumped into air molecules and transferred their momentum - its molecules would just...slow down. All of them at once, The metal would pass from above to below its melting point in 0 time.

I'm not sure what you'd get if you did that? Maybe an amorphous solid with no crystalline structure? Or would the metal dissociate into dust?

What about boundary effects? If every molecule in the effected area is arbitrarily slowed down or sped up to the same speed, molecules that straddle the boundary will...be torqued? I don't know whether torque makes any sense in chemistry. Maybe molecules on the boundary get ripped apart, so there's this fizz of re-combining ions whenever you use your power, stronger or weaker depending on the difference between real temperature and fiat temperate. That's kind of cool, and maybe it gives you a place to dump all that entropy.
