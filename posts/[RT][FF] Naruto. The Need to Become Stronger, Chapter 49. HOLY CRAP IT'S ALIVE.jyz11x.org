**** [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Waves Arisen]] is a completed one.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/naruto-lighting-up-the-dark.51004/][Lighting up the Dark]] was recentlyish revived (updated last month, chapter before that was last december)

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]] has been consistently updating for a while (but is a quest, not a fic)

***** I'll second the Waves Arisen recommendation - it's still my all time favorite Naruto fanfic aside from my own. I really admire how good the author is at moving the plot along and conveying emotion with just a few words. Definitely something I've tried to learn from.

(I recently reread chapter 22, the attack on the Mist, and hoo boy did I like words a lot back then. Some of those paragraphs are thicker than my forearm. Sheesh.)

I also recently reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds][Black Cloaks, Red Clouds]], a fanfic from Tenten's POV. It's dead, sadly, but I did like a lot of the interesting concepts and the sense of having multiple sides each with their own perspective. I stole some ideas from this fic so I figure I owe it a rec, even if it does have a few flaws (for the love of god author stop having characters "murmur" everything. Just use "said" like a normal person.)

I liked the concept of Marked for Death but I feel like it gravitated more towards just being a regular fic since none of the characters ever died despite the premise. It's also, uh, a *lot* to read, especially if you try to read the reader inputs as well to understand why decisions were made (seriously don't). I loved [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-308#post-5665240][this scene]], though!

I found Lighting up the Dark to be a little too silly to really count as Rationalfic. The whole concept of a "Nine-Brained Demon Fox" is something that's better suited for an Omake IMO. More importantly, I maintain that realism is a prerequisite for rationality, because otherwise the whole optimization aspect doesn't really work. Sure, Naruto basing his strategies on manga stories is funny, but it makes it feel like character decisions and outcomes are based on rule of funny which kind of defeats the point. I think one of the reasons why people like my action scenes so much is because the characters treat them like actual life-or-death situations.

But, that's just my two cents!

****** Isn't the thing you dislike about LUTD something that only really happens initially, when the stakes are low?

Also, I assume when it comes to your criticism of MfD, your issue is with the survival of specifically the MC's team? Can you really blame the writers of a quest because their players managed to play well? Anyway, at least one character that matters to the MC did die and drop the floor from under us.

******* I didn't read all of LUTD so I can't say for sure, but the last time I checked was somewhere during the Chunin exams. The characters were doing wisecracks while throwing deadly weapons at each other and explaining their moves, anime-style. "Actually, you thought I was gonna do X, but I knew that you knew I would think that so..." I really don't wanna complain about it too much, but I don't think that stuff is rational.

When it comes to MFD, I am genuinely impressed with all the work and effort they put into the world and how consistently they managed to update it. Especially considering all the user input they have to compile on top of that! But, it just isn't the story I was expecting to read when I first saw the premise. I thought it would be a death world fic, with characters set in a super realistic setting where the readers have to think like actual ninjas to survive. Instead, it kind of became a slice of life fic, with the main character changing personality from scarily efficient killer into a goofy anime protagonist with a weird list fetish. :p

**** Not exactly a /rational/ fanfiction, but definitely a crunchier, harder fiction that I don't know I've seen mentioned on this subreddit, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9250029/1/Shinobi-Team-7][Shinobi: Team 7]] is easily the best Naruto fanfiction I've read. It's discontinued, with a reboot currently being put out by the writer. It adds history and culture to a world that desperately needed it - without feeling anchored in exposition - and the prose is frequently delightful, which is so rare in fanfiction.

***** Thanks for the rec. I read the first few chapters, but so far I feel like there's not nearly enough plot tension. I mean, chapter 1 has a scene where nothing happens except Asuma and Kurenai get together and it literally ends with Naruto going "well, that was boring and pointless". The next few chapters are the same.

The extra world building also seems a bit redundant: Lots of random "as you know..." scenes that only serve to slow down the story and prevent it from going anywhere. A hundred years of history are added... why? It still ends with the Third being in charge and Naruto being the Kyubi's host etc. And it doesn't fix any of the stuff that makes no sense such as Naruto growing up as an orphan, so what's the point of it?

I'm afraid I might be starting to sound like a dick so I'll stop there, but I have to admit I'm starting to feel really confused. Why does NTBS keep getting rated lower than stories like these? I looked up a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDOumXUQsn6qrRtqE-0R-DXULllAW_gTi_7z6nvS0oU/edit][list of top Naruto fanfics]] the other day, and not only was NTBS not mentioned, but the "gold standard" for Naruto combat scenes was... [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9599662/6/Team-Seven-Shinobi-At-War][this Sakura vs Mizuki fight]].

I must be doing something wrong, but I'll be damned if I know what.

****** I think it meanders in the beginning, but I think that's true of most Naruto fanfiction, especially the ones that start in the academy or before it. In S:T7, I at least enjoy the writing, you know? The childhood stuff can be cartoon-y fluff, but I'll take this particular brand of non-child over some of the weirder brands of non-children that are present in so many Naruto stories.

I also happen to really enjoy a lot of the world building, even when it's tenuously connected to the present story. I would say the lore helps bury the foreshadowing, in some regards. For me, there's a sense of verisimilitude that it earns by making the characters so small in their own world. And the characters feel more like people for it, with deeper prejudices or different roles than in canon, and I think that's achieved at least in part by the world. Naruto feels significantly more like a person with a slightly above average intelligence and a learning disorder, than he does in most stories and that really appeals to me. For my tastes, the little details add up to something more than the parts.

I wouldn't say it adheres to canon despite the world building. It's kind of a moot point, with the story being abandoned, but there are interesting (to me) changes that could have borne fruit. The Senju and Uchiha are both alive and thriving, Jiraiya half-ass teaches Sakura the rasengan, Itachi is the hokage for much of the story's length, Orochimaru is a warlord legally recognized by the Daimyo of Land of Fire, Zabuza's rebellion seems to have succeeded, the Akatsuki (Pein and the Zetsus, specifically) have some interesting departures from canon, Tsunade becomes their tentative guest, etc.

Plus I'm a sucker for any story that tries to make chakra in a Sanderson-esque magic system, which the story flirts with near the last chapter.

As for the rest of your comment, I don't know? Different strokes for different folks? I've not read the story you linked, nor did I write the list. I can say, very comfortably, that I think most Naruto fanfiction is terrible. A good chunk of it is really, really bad, in my opinion. That said, whatever the criteria it is that qualifies a story as a thing I like, Shinobi: Team 7 clears that bar.

** So as of right now there's the Sasuke betrayal and the atkatsuki as the general issues the story needs to resolve, right? I really want Naruto to lean into Kurama like he did in canon, I think that bond is still really rational. Has to be munchkinable.

Also I loved the sharingan/gates revelation, that shit is the pinnacle of taking canon and making it rational.

*** Whoops, I forgot to reply to this.

Sasuke and Akatsuki loom pretty big on the horizon, yeah. But there are also broader issues like Naruto's attempts to teach his peers how the world really works, the Ninja system being messed up, Sakura being kidnapped etc. As far as I'm concerned every major character has their own arc that comes complete with their own issue which the story needs to resolve (Unlike canon which just... never does. The Hyuga clan etc.).

Good news: Kurama definitely has more of a role in coming chapters. I can't have Naruto rely too much on ol' Kura-chan though because that would violate rational fiction's #1 rule of not being allowed to solve problems by just being massively OP. :P

I'm glad you liked the Sharingan/Gates stuff! Explaining canon weirdness is always a challenge, but that makes it all the more rewarding when it works out.
