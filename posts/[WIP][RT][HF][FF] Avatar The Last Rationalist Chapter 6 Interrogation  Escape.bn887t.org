*** Thanks I won't be abandoning this story considering how much time I put into it. I also like it when he teaches people. It's fun to write those parts. Thanks for sticking with me through the delays.

** It's like all the really unusual and nonstandard stories are all starting back up again!

It's good to have an update to this after so long. I restate that I enjoy how /both/ Lotus organizations exist and are very pervasive in the world, instead of the Reds just being made up several seasons later for a quick plot point. Still, there are a couple of issues that are tugging at my brain.

The entire last sequence (after the line break) seems rather... rushed? The pace was fairly slow and detailed all the way up to that point, then everything was just summed up rather quickly. I know that most people will only read it if they know the source material, but the entire flight of Aang and later his going into Avatar mode was just done very quickly. Aside from little descriptive detail, which I assume I just assumed that people will remember the show, this seems like a *very* important moment for our main character, who is still going through identity issues and trying to understand how the world works. I hope we get to see this perspective shift and his thoughts on it in the next update!

The "World is a Matrix" thing still irritates me. It seems to be a common thing in many Rat stories, but its particularly unusual in this one, especially given that the main character remembers the Avatar world from before he remembers 'normal' Earth. I rather hope that the Avatar world is itself not a simulation, but I guess I will have to wait and see.

*** Thanks for the feedback. You're right in that the last bit felt rushed. It felt rushed for me too. I'll revamp it at a later time. Thing is I just really wanted to get out of the South Pole because it has been six months or longer since I started the story and I was still stuck there. I'll come back to it soon and add more descriptive detail. Very slight spoilers ahead. Finally I hate the idea of the "world is a matrix" as well. Never did like how it meant nothing of consequence happened. This story isn't a matrix one or a parallel universe but something else. Thanks again.

IMO, it only means "nothing of consequence happened" if they eventually leave the simulation and it stops existing. I mean, I think most of us on this sub can agree that a sufficiently detailed and accurate simulation of a person IS a person. Worth the Candle seems to be firmly in the "very very likely to be a simulation" camp, but personally that doesn't make any of it seem pointless to me.

Not saying yours should be one or trying to convince you of anything, mind you, just putting in my two cents on the subject.
