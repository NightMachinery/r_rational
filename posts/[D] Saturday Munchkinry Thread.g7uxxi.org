Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Soul Infusion

You ritually cut out a portion of your soul and infuse it into an object. This allows you to telekinetically control, strengthen, and repair the object. You are limited in how many objects you can infuse, with the norm being between four to six. The object must be able to be carried or transportable by your person. As it is literally tied to your well being. If the object is stolen and leaves your presence, you can sense the direction and area around it so you can track it but you will begin to slowly mentally and emotionally degrade if you are away from it for too long. Destroying an infused object permanently while it is near a user is very difficult as a user can repair or even regrow it from almost nothing over time. If a user chooses to, they can simply absorb back the soul essence of a destroyed object so they can create a new one.

Potential Uses:

The power in question is a magic ritual for an AU Batman story I am working on where Batman and later his rogue's gallery studies magic along with technology which they use in limited but very effective ways. Batman created the ritual and later taught it to the Bat-family. He uses it to strengthen and empower his equipment as well as provide a reason for why his equipment is so much better than everyone else's. His cape can support his weight allowing him to glide, his armor is tougher/makes him faster, his grapple gun's small motor is strong enough to shoot him through the air, and his bat computer is literally magical and helps explain his detective vision.

Oracle: Uses it to become a magical hacker and creates a drone/golem that is designed to look like batgirl and lets her control it in the field.

Red Hood: Jason Todd uses it to act as a necromancer, killing mob bosses and supervillains which he then infuses to control their dead bodies like puppets as long as they are near him. He uses it to systematically replace crime lords to take over their organizations while pretending to be their bodyguard to explain his close presence.

Lucius Fox- he figured out how to infuse an entire building by personally building and repairing the entire thing by hand and then living in it for several years before trying the ritual. It makes him very powerful inside of it but he hates to leave it.

*** If you can regrow objects that have been damaged, that seems like a way to create matter from nothing. Can I infuse an ingot of metal, cut it in half, then regrow the bar and repeat indefinitely? If the ritual became public knowledge, I would expect factories to pop up exploiting this.

Would regrowing and repairing work with food? Having some food that's always fresh and replenishes itself would be interesting. Does regrowing work on fluids?

**** The energy to repair/regrow an object comes from the user and the process is very slow and requires a lot of concentration/mental focus that few people can easily do. It's more that any object infused can't be destroyed permanently rather than a magical copier. If you infused say a metal ingot and cut it in half you have to focus on one part to grow it back. The part you didn't focus on would start to crumble/decay as the other half regrew.

That said, it is magic so I think for a master who had gathered or generated a lot of mana and had amazing mental discipline, they COULD copy an object this way. Not indefinitely as the energy requirements would be large and the object is tied to your soul, so constantly cutting/regrowing objects is probably not very pleasant. But it should be possible. I don't think it would be widespread just because magic itself is not widespread or easily learned in this universe.

It would work on food. A necromancer using this ritual could repair a broken zombie and the same principle would work on a say a cooked turkey. I think there would probably be side effects if anyone except the user actually ate this food, I mean eating a magical voodoo doll tied to someone else's soul can't be that healthy.

Liquids? I think it would work as long the amount was not much and it was enclosed into an object. A bottle of soda that replenished itself if you concentrate on it.

*** How do you define 'object'?\\
Can I choose small animal or child?

**** Can't be something living, there is a mass limit that is smaller than your body, and you have to be able to carry or move it with just your body. But you can cheat on the mass and carry limit if you have a lot of knowledge of the object and it is spiritually significant to you. A car could work but would probably count as five or six objects and you wouldn't be able to infuse anything else. But you do some crazy stuff in that car. Someone else might just pick the steering wheel and wheels which would accomplish something similar might cost only two or three objects since they are connected. But if you built/restored that car piece by piece with a parent, you know it inside and out, and it has a bunch of significant memories/feelings to you, you could infuse the whole car while having it only count as one object.

A living animal or child would not work. It would if they were dead and not that big.

***** Can I cast it on people bones?

Bones are not living, they are just... part of the living. Can I use it to enchant my partner bones to grow stronger or heal faster?

****** Bones do count as living though. It isn't commonly known but they do have cells, nerves, blood vessels, and pain receptors. I think you could do surgery to a partner where you replaced say the bones of their arms or legs with implants that could do something similar though.

** I recently watched Avatar the last airbender, where some "benders" can control different elements. It made me think about telekinesis, especially in the part where an old woman can control people by telekinetically moving the water in their bodies. Of course, there is endless works of fiction that involve telekinetic powers, but I think that it is a power way more versatile than you might think. Before I start listing ways it can be used, I'd like to precise that telekinetic powers are rarely universal (ie they often have restriction like specific materials, no human telekinesis or extremely crude control), but for example's sake, lets give our character telekinesis that has extremely good control, can affect all materials but can't affect inside a human body (crushing specific neuronal cells would be too easy) and has very low strength (can barely lift a small rock).

With this out of the way, how could it be abused? Here are my ideas:

1- Slowing each individual molecules of a liquid substance to decrease it's temperature, or the opposite. For example, if someone has a bottle of water you can quickly make it explode if you increase the temperature enough and transform the water in gas form. The same technique applies if you simply want to highly increase the temperature in a room. It could even light fires if the temperature gets high enough.

2- If you posses long range telekinesis, creating long range machines is a piece of cake. You install very precise quartz pressure sensors and it lets you activate anything at a long range with the lone power of your mind. For example, creating an ambush situation without being in the line of fire by putting pressure sensitive devices that the telekinetic can activate from afar.

3- Telekinesis, at that scale of precision, can become a super easy way of making lots of money. It could have countless experimental benefits, and many companies would pay a fortune to use it. For example, it's easy to purify any substance, and there must be ways to create energy, by activating certain chemical reactions and reversing it by reforming molecules (I'm not sure how that would work).

I feel like there must be way more other uses. If you have more ideas please tell me :)

*** 1. Kill non-human living things. A great exterminator.
2. Kill humans anyway. If you have such a specific control of molecules, just move undetectable amounts of poison near their airways and allow it to slowly collect into their body into detectable amounts. If you want to be less obvious about it, use Carbon Monoxide.
3. It would be ridiculously exploitable with chemistry.
