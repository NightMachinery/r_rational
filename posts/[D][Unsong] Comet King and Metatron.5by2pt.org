Spoilers for chapters 22 and 44 at least.

We are told that The Comet King looked for Metatron in order to get the Holy Name of God in order to create and destroy worlds, and break the hold of Hell on the souls within it. But what if there was a more practical solution (and the stated solution unlikely)?

Because we also know that there are four levels of Kabbalah, and that using the holy names of God is the Worldly Kabbalah, the lowest form, and it doesn't sound like this would have the power to eliminate and create worlds -- Worldly doesn't mean that (although there may be some weird kabbalistic significance to the category name -- I can't rule that out -- but then why is it the lowest form and the higher forms are the ones used to run the universe?). I submit that, since he had already defended himself successfully in battle against Thamiel, all he would really need is functional immortality, and the logistics kinda take care of themselves.

I'll submit several quotes from the Bible here:

Luke 10:25-28

| On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

| "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"

| He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

| "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."

I take this to mean that The Comet King figured his missing piece was to love God with All Your Heart, his fantastic ship, as well. But that's not the only potentially interesting verse:

Matthew 19:16-21

| Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"

| "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."

| "Which ones?" he inquired. Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"

| "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"

| Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."

And that's precisely what he did! He followed him with satellites and then built a literal ship to follow him as he ran around the world.

If you can win a battle, and can't die, that would be enough.

I have no explanation for why people think he's dead, though. Maybe he's not. Could be working together with The Other King on some massive plot. Unknown.


** People think he's dead because his body fell out of the sky and The Other King still lives. Unlives? We don't know his life status, actually.

Granted, TKC could definitely fake a body if he wanted to, but it doesn't fit any of the prophesies we know right now.

*** Well he could be positioning himself to /also/ be the other Messiah right? Let himself die metaphorically, and then wait until Israel is messed up and then boom hes fulfilling the prophecy for the greater Messiah.

*** Even regardless of prophecies, I don't think The Komet Cing would do that.

** I propose that for any futures essay of this nature, you have to do it in character, as if you were posting it to a mailing list on Kabbalah.
