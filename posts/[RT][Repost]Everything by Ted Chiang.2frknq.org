Ted Chiang is an author noteworthy for his excellent rational science fiction. I consider his work to be some of the most relevant to this subreddit. He pretty much exclusively writes short stories, and they're all amazing. Many of you will have read his work, but I feel like since it has been 6 months since the last "Everything by Ted Chiang" post, it's time for a new post to show our new readers some of the very best this genre has to offer.

The first work of his I read was [[http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html][Exhalation]], the story of a scientist who isn't afraid to face the truth. I cried at the end, because the beauty of the story was too much for me. Read it first, and you will end up reading the rest of his work.

Many of his short stories are in a collection for sale on [[http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720/][Amazon]], or you can read them [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/tower.html][online]]. One short story, [[http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang][The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling]] is not in that collection, but is available online and generally considered an excellent rationalist work.

I highly recommend all of Ted Chiang's work. Thanks to [[/u/Tasty_Yogurt]] and [[/u/CalebJohnsn]] for finding links, and [[/u/embrodski]] for making [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1y5x3k/everything_by_ted_chiang/][the last version]] of this thread.

** Now if only he'd write more than one story a year or, God forbid, a novel, but I guess that's what you pay for each story being utterly brilliant.

*** I had the good fortune to talk to him at a Denver lit con and asked him about that. He said that he has no intention of writing a novel. He feels the novelette/novella is exactly the right length for exploring the subjects he wants to explore, and stretching them into a novel would be a disservice to his readers and isn't in any way appealing to him.

Obviously nothing in life is certain, but it may be a long time /if/ we ever do get a novel.
