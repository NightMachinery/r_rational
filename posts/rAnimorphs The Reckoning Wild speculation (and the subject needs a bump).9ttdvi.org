Shotgunned this in under a week. The Wheels Are Turning™.

In the theory that if you want to move the Overton window, you have to make something look inevitable, in hindsight.

I'm running out of time tonight, but I want to write this down for later amusement.

- *Aftran Memorial University* - that is all.
- Who said your commitment was three days? Day labor is also an option.
- What about apprenticeships? Learn to build and operate hyperdrives, and the physics behind them.
- Three day on, four day off shifts will be familiar to nurses. What services and products can alien brain slugs provide, in order to /hire hosts?/ Boy, howdy, can I think of a few... Basically, all the hosts they could ever need, just /learn2capitalism./

*** Just taking a wild guess at what the poster is thinking, but I think they were very rushed and posted their thoughts about what the Yeerks should do to make themselves appealing to the humans.

[[http://animorphs.wikia.com/wiki/Aftran_942][Aftran]] is the Yeerk who convinced Cassie in the original series that Yeerks were individuals instead of faceless crowds. Naming a university after Aftran is probably something about researching ways to help Yeerks integrate into human society.

Day labor is a reference about how there are already people who can be hired for only a day at a time and how they can simply host Yeerks for just a day instead of the full three days.

Nurses are people who often work for 12 hours for three days and get the other four days in the week off and Yeerk hosts can have a similar work week.

The rest is about what Yeerks can teach and help humanity in return for having available hosts.

Basically this post is a very compressed stream of thoughts about how Yeerks and humans can join as one social group, but I don't really see how this post is relevant to the latest chapters in Reckoning since the two races aren't anywhere near to peace talks.

**** Very rushed? You bet. It was a long day, and the speculation happened over a lawn mower, and didn't get posted for three or six hours or so.

Re: Aftran, I didn't read the core series, but I wanted to -- but that was an *expensive* proposition. The outrage over Aftran's murder in R!Animorphs and their progressive leanings here make it sound like a thing that you could sell.

Day labor: Correct-ish. $20 an hour will convince plenty of people that hosting an alien brain-slug is a good side hustle or a good way to keep a roof overhead.

Nurses: My father has said schedule. It's grueling, but hosts don't have to be worked as hard as nurses, and Yeerk health care plans can be rather more generous.

Yes!

It's not, but I can see a trajectory where this ends up in a United Federation of Planets, with a little good fortune.

I don't expect it to go there, 'cause of certain agents whose actions are contrary to the goal of a happy coexistence, but I have a lot of fun in the what-ifs.

** Your post is a bit incoherent, but if I understand you correctly you are suggesting the yeerks pay people (with money or knowledge) to be part time hosts?

If so, there are a number of significant problems with having your employer be able to riffle through all your thoughts and memories at will.

*** My post is definitely incoherent; it was a just-before-bed insight.

Yes, that's what I'm suggesting. It's more politically plausible, in America where the first pools were dropped, than two-year commitments. Any comparisons to day labor are entirely deliberate. :p
