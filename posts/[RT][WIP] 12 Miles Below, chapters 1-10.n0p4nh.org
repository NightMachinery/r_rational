The world is in ruins. 

Extreme sub-zero temperatures suffocate the surface, making even simple survival an ordeal. Frozen derelicts of bygone eras span across massive ice wastes. And the elite few hoard any technology rediscovered within.

The only escape from the deadly climate is beneath the surface. But it's another disaster underground. Monstrous machines lurk in the depths. Unhinged demigods war against them, dying over and over, treating it all like a game. The land itself shifts over time, more contraption than rock. And an ominous prophecy states that the key to everything waits at the last level - but nobody's ever reached that far. 

When an expedition into the far uncharted north goes terribly wrong for Keith Winterscar, he finds himself trapped - in a place from which nobody expects a simple surface scavenger to escape. Stumbling upon an ancient power struggle of titanic scale; Keith will have to contend against gods, legends, and the secrets of the realm that lies below. 

------

I've been a big fan of rational fics for years now, following WtC, PGtE, MoL, and the others. I thought I'd try my hand out at it. If the above peaked your interest, give it a go! I plan to post biweekly on Monday and Thursdays, and I have 60 chapters stocked up wrapping up arc 1.

The main character falls under the tech-hero archetype. He does mess up, gets too greedy for his britches occasionally, but does his best coming up with plans and solutions given what he knows.


** I was a beta reader for this so I'm biased and take this with a grain of salt - but I can confidently say that it's an incredibly well written story.

you can tell how much time was put into the world building and character development. i'm not big on settings like this one, but got sucked in (i planned to bail after beta reading and was hooked for the long haul).

** Holy shit this was fantastic!

I really love the rich setting and the worldbuilding so far. It's super unique, and I'm really interested where it goes next.

I don't have many complaints, really. Also, note that I did really like the story, I'm just complaining about the stuff I disliked because I want it to be the best it can be.

Firstly, I feel like the sister's personality completely changed after chapter 1. It felt out of character for her to accept the challenge like that, and I feel like she became way more humourous after the first chapter. Also, regarding the challenge, I don't understand why she chose something she was clearly favored to lose in. Stereotypical rich bitch obviously had an advantage, because she's rich.

My second complaint isn't really a plothole or anything, but it felt really, really stupid for the MC to turn the building's power back on without telling anyone. There's no way that could have gone well.

Finally...I don't understand why the father is so adamant about the MC being a knight. I do understand that it has to be him, because his sister apparently needs to have children for the bloodline to go on. And the father wants her to have kids, but she doesn't. So... can't the MC transfer the suit to her? The MC is never, ever going to be a warrior like the father wants, so I really don't get why he thinks that his son will become a new person after 18 years.

Regardless, this was a fantastic start, and I'm really excited to see what comes next!

*** *EDIT*: Feedback has been implemented, going to edit out some of the possible spoilers previously in this post.

---

Always appreciate feedback! Strong feelings about the story point that you really clicked with it, you wouldn't care to comment on a 'meh' story

I've modified the first chapter and the challange chapter to expand some more details and address those issues.

It absolutely was stupid to pull the lever, practically every bit of foreshadowing in the story was screaming it would blow up on his face. It's the sort of thing I wanted people to think "Don't do it you stupid little git!" But it's 100% the sort of sneakery that house Winterscar's infamous for, and Keith grew up absorbing too much of that unintentionally. Greed is a powerful motivator and he convinced himself he'd get away with it. Let's put it this way: If Kieth were stuck in the cave of wonders in Alladin, as he is right now, he'd get loot fever and touch the shiny.

On your last part, I really can't tell you much other then it would be spoilers to tell you now. Father's got his own baggage, ideals, promises to keep, goals to accomplish and all. I've added some more dialog that was originally cut for that section now.

I'd rather put too little exposition and have readers point out they want more like you did, rather then have too much exposition, and see readers glaze over and close the book.

Thanks for your feedback! I'll put it to use!

Now that I think about it, that does make perfect sense. Even in chapter 1, he got greedy, someone got seriously hurt, and yet he faced zero consequences. I can understand why he never learned that lesson.

** I've really enjoyed these chapters! I think that your portrayal of Keith as having internalized the behaviors of his erstwhile clan is quite successful and the world building is also very exciting. I have to say though, I hope you include a bit more description of people: I know that everyone's wearing protective gear, but it sort of bothers me that I can't picture any of the Winterscars well. Like, what's Keith's eye color, hair? How tall are Keith and Kidra? But I'm excited to see where this goes!

*** Hmmm, not a lot of opportunity to describe people right now. I can let you know how they look like since it's not a spoiler though, just to help you mentally map it out. This would be pulled from my notes:

Kidra: Black medium hair, blue eyes, about 5'10". A face that's conventionally pretty, paired with an piercing gaze that makes anyone suddenly self-conscious. She enjoys playing with eye shadow to double down on this effect.

Kieth: Shaggy brown hair and brown eyes. Freckles. 5'11" with a face that looks like it would be more complete with glasses and too boyish to ever grow a beard. Rail thin. Usually has soot or dirt as an almost permanent feature on his cheeks and forehead. A first glance might make someone suspect an overworked engineer, and a second look will make them pat their wallets just to check it's still there.

Tenisent Winterscar: Is described in the story at chapter 36

** I just read through chapter 11 thanks to this post. I'm excited to keep going! The world feels like a mix between Horizon Zero Dawn and Warhammer 40k with a little splash of Stormlight Archive.

*** I spent a ton of time studying his free word copy of Warbreaker just to see how he wrote and try to emulate that style! Basically shamelessly stole how he handles worldbuilding - using it as treats for his readers, dropping hints and foreshadowing and letting people play around with their own theories ahead of time. Best moments were always the reveals, when suddenly something secret about the world clicked and you had that "OHHHH" moment. I'm hoping I can do that in this story!

** I haven't read it yet, but I see you've been posting a chapter to RR every 1-2 days. I might recommend slowing that down, if you have any backlog left, since maintaining that pace will be nigh impossible.

*** I've got 60 chapters on backlog that wrap up the first story arc. I'm posting Monday and Thursday now though, since only the first 10 chapters had been beta read and polished up. The rest of the chapters are setup, but haven't seen more thorough editing.

I wrote first because you can't get discouraged from an imaginary audience lol, now no matter what happens, at least the book ends on a complete story.

** Checked the story. World building is interesting, as advertised. MC is too annoying though.

If asked to take the story as rational with low internal contradictions... After he risks lifes of other people twice in hostile environment, I expect that he would have faced a tribunal and execution (or something like that) for similar actions long time ago.

*** That's good feedback, thanks for letting me know! I'll go back to chapter 5 where they haggle out the remediation and see if I can make it more clear on how this sort of thing is handled between Houses.

*** I agree. interesting premise and good worldbuilding, but the MC has a chip on his shoulder and is constantly in "Daddy doesn't love me" mode.

It's also pretty obvious that he's not as clever as he thinks, and is going to drag others down with him when he falls after one too many dumb risks.

I'm not saying I don't like the story, it's fun and I'll follow it, but the MC really needs a reality check and an extra dose of humility. I guess we'll just have to wait his character growth period.

**** Can't say anything without spoiling stuff, but you be right on the money! Actions beget consequences and no one can earn courage without first spending time as a coward. There's the whole typical hero's journey for the little bugger, glad you're staying tuned for it!
