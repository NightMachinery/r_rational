** A problem - I believe this series is relevant content for this subreddit, and I want to bring attention to the series where possible. On the other hand, I don't want to be percieved as spamming content nobody else likes. The solution, of course, is to post it on a monthly basis instead - nobody can accuse me of posting too much that way, and there's practical benefits too, like making it easier for new readers to get some idea of how the series is written.

As luck would have it, the series itself is also moving onto a monthly schedule, starting with the next chapter. ([[/r/worldtrigger]] is praying that this marks the end of the intermittent hiatuses.) Thus, this is the only batch of four chapters (~80 pages total) I'll post, and future posts will likely be monthly chapters of about 40 pages.

** I've only seen the anime, but this series never struck me as rational or even particularly rational-adjacent.

*** That's unfortunate. Hoping to avoid a protracted argument about the series' proper category, I'll refer to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9rn8ra/-/e8i53oc/][thoughts]] I posted alongside the previous chapter.

Besides that, I will say the anime is widely considered a mediocre to terrible adaption.

I suppose I'll stop posting this if complaints of this kind become commonplace, but for now I'll wait and see.

**** I'm happy for these posts to stick around if people find them valuable; we get few enough posts in the subreddit that nobody is going to be inconvenienced with a few extra that not everyone agrees about. I actually liked the anime FWIW.

*** When I posted the last chapter, I wrote a +short+ [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9rn8ra/-/e8i53oc/][introduction]] to the series, which I suppose I should link to for the next several chapter posts.

I suppose I still haven't said much about the object-level story, which is perhaps a bad habit of mine, so I'll try doing that as well. Just in case someone gets bored halfway through, I'll start by linking to the [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-1-page-3.html][first chapter]].

*The backstory* is we have a regular Japanese city - Mikado - which is one day invaded by invincible monsters ("Neighbors") from another dimension. After an initial curb-stomp battle, a previously secret organization ("Border") shows up and beats the invaders back using their own phlebotium, and subsequently establish a reliable defense such that most of the population chooses to stay. The story is set four years later, at which point Border has expanded significantly by recruiting members from the city, operates publicly with a PR director and all, and it's defensive efforts have been reduced to regular skirmishes. The story opens with a quiet upper middle schooler ("Mikumo") and a mysterious transfer student, ("Kuga") both of whom have a some - not immediately obvious - relation to Border.

*The story officially has four main characters.* Besides Mikumo and Kuga, there is Jin, a veteran of Border's secret years, constantly scheming to keep people mostly alive and unhurt, and Amatori, largely a protege of the rest of the cast, with significant power but little experience. (Jin is rarely a viewpoint character, so the "main cast minus Jin" is henceforth the "core cast")

*The first arc(s?)* revolves around a rift in Border's internal politics, which the core characters quickly get swept up in, causing no end of conflict and sometimes outright fighting. After significant mediating (and some meddling) by Jin, everyone is on the same page enough that they don't come to blows, and the entire core cast are members of Border proper. Past that, there are several significant threads with different degrees of focus over time.

- *Invasions* are all-hands-on-deck situations where Neighbor factions (Did I mention they're a politically complicated bunch?) throw significant forces at the city at once, and stakes are typically heightened. Border as an organization is competent and well developed, and the ensuing battles reflect this, with dozens of named characters pulling more or less equal weight. (With a handful of more significant outliers, who aren't necessarily the core characters - they weren't even around for the last major serious battle)

- *Ranks Wars* are the overall name given to Border's internal training and evaluation battles, fought between (teams of) members. These are the primary means of advancing in status as combatants, which the core characters need to do for complicated reasons. This is complicated by their team's highly unbalanced composition, which their lead strategist does their best to work around in creative ways. A recurring question is how far they can take this in a setting where the competitors aren't stupid, and often quite capable of strategizing themselves. These fights also provide attention to the rest of Border's members' stories and motivations, which aren't exceptional in themselves, but reasonably varied for such a large cast.

- *The Backstory* is relatively low-key by comparison. Nevertheless, there is a significant sense that much of the secondary cast are heroes of another story - Border's time as a secret venture - the rough contours of which are still being discovered. This overlaps with some questions about the core characters' immediate past before the story, and that's about as far as we've gotten.

Alright, phew. That became kind of long, but I'm reasonably satisfied with it as a summary, and I even managed to dance around the most basic late arrival spoilers. I tried to minimize reflection on /why/ I think this is well executed, since I did most of that in the other comment.
