** I think it was recommended here before (not sure), but I'd like to re-recommend '[[https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/chapters/][Kusuriya no Hitorigoto]]'. Young pharmacist gets kidnapped and starts working in Inner Palace. She uses her intelligence and herb knowledge to cure people and solve mysteries. Amazing art. Great story.

** Can someone recommend something where characters other than the MC munchkinry shit? I find it really really annoying when the MC has the same power as everyone else, but thinks of obvious loopholes that somehow noone else has thought of. It just makes no sense.

A more general idea would be where everybody including the MC abuse the shit out of magic -which in fact makes the MC super weak when they start off and elite tier (NOT GOD TIER) as the series progresses. At no point should they become vastly stronger than everyone else unless they have something that no one else has (and there should be a rational reason for why noone else has it).

This is sorta progression fantasy, but almost everything I've read in this genre falls into the trap of only the MC abusing shit and everyone else has the brain of a 5 year old.

A great example of what I am looking for would be cradle where in the latest book, the MC competes on the world stage and realizes how thouraghly outclassed he is. Everything he has done, someone else has tried before and concluded it is suboptimal which is why noone else is doing it. The things that he has going for him are things that he lucked into, or was given.

*** That's more commonly seen in different stories with different power scales, where if there's magic the MC doesn't and mages are just as fragile as normal people. What you'll generally find is that the villain did the munchkinry or is trying to do it.

​

Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson has this, the evil immortal god emperor, became immortal and super powerful by doing munchkinry. I could go into specifics but that's basically the best part of the first book..

​

And the best thing is, his munchkinry checks out, it fits the magic system, we have a scene of him doing it to maintain his immortality, and it's nothing boring like sacrificing people or anything cliche like that, just a loophole in the magic system he found and exploits.

​

Raven's Mark series has this too, but the magic system is much softer and the MC isn't a mage, the books tend to be about him either helping his mage gods trick the enemy gods to fall into a munchkinry trap, or stopping evil people from doing munchkinry to become gods.. It's pretty good, not mistborn level, but still better than most and very well reviewed.

However, while it starts out pretty strong, I found the overarching plot to be repetitive in an unsatisfying way.

*** There's The Zombie Knight Saga. Here are some abilities that other characters leverage. Mild spoilers:

- There's a mechanic that if you push someone too hard they become desperate and sometimes get a power up. It's only a quantitative powerup though (so like, better control, more amount, etc.), not a qualititative one, but it still can alter the balance of a fight. So battles are a careful balance between not pushing hard enough and pushing too hard. This powerup happens to enemies and friends alike.

- The really strong people have the best control over their power, which lets them use it in different ways. For example, some people can materialize (mostly) pure elements. As they get better they can materialize the element in different states (solid, liquid, gas). As they get better they can materialize it /moving/ (like shooting discs of metal, javelins, etc.). The really high level people can materialize allotropes, put dynamic states on what they materialize, and so on.

- And you bet everyone exploits the hell out of what their power can do. The sodium guy makes on-the-spot explosives. The oxygen guy makes jets of air around his body to fly like iron man. There's a fight where a really strong guy with lasers was stalled by an aluminum materializer, who made mirrors. And it goes on.

The Zombie Knight Saga /does/ sorta fall into the munchkinry trope where the mc figures out things others haven't, but I think it's done in a believable way. What he figures out has more to do with things he has intrinsically that others don't, as well as a synergy that people didn't figure out because the starting components of it were genuinely useless. And whaddya know, once he figures it out other people ask him to learn it, and they figure it out too.

**** I want it to mirror the real world, aka be RATIONAL. In the real world noone is successful purely on willpower or discipline. Noone.

Everybody who is successful relies upon: a great deal of luck in their circumstances and timing, along with their own individual intuition, creativity and willpower/discipline.

Having more Intuition, creativity and willpower can compensate for having shittier luck and vise versa, but then I have to see that that the MC really has that willpower or that genius level intellect. Most MC's don't- most MC's have slightly above average intellect, along with a decent amount of willpower/discipline (very very rarely do MC's have an consistent, inhuman amount of willpower).

That is NOWHERE near enough, in a rational world to propel them to the heights that MC's usually achieve. So something has to be given to them, or the world isn't rational.

***** Yes, my yardstick for realism is that a character getting lucky /once/ is reasonable - there's a reason this character succeeded where someone else failed, and across enough people /someone's/ got to get lucky. I don't always care about this rule because sometimes you just want to enjoy a popcorn power fantasy or some such, though.

One pseudo-exception to this rule for me is usually xianxia - yes they're blatant power fantasies, but they're also usually written in cosmologies that include a ridiculously large population. As such, across such a population not just one person but quite a lot of people are going to get "unreasonably" lucky - we're following the guy who didn't just get unreasonably lucky, but more unreasonably lucky than everyone else. It's pretty much the same reasoning as before, applied to larger numbers.

Of course, that's just the reason why it's arguably justified. The reason it doesn't /bother/ me is, again, because I'm reading a popcorn power fantasy.

****** I like to think of books in three categorie, by the number of 'gimmes' the main character gets.

1 gimme: Hard rational. Something incites the work, but other than that pure logic has to carry the main character through. For example, an ordinary (if rather clever) dude finds a halting oracle.\\
2 gimmes: Rational. You get to pick a convenient main character, and then they get a single gimme. A mathematician gets isekai'd into a land where magic is based on mathematics.\\
2+1 gimmes: Soft rational. Convenient main character, inciting event, plus one lucky coincidence. A rational work where a smart character also gets an OP ability, or an otherwise-rational work where about once an arc you can expect something to go in the main character's favor by sheer chance. HPMOR\\
4+ gimmes: ordinary fiction.

**** Ima be entirely honest, Wake of the Ravager is exactly what I was talking about when I say that other characters don't munchkin. The only real advantage that Calvin has is: Mutations + Eliot.

If Eliot can change which abilities he gets offered then ignore everything I say, but it is my understanding that Eliot only effects Mutations. So then, why is it that every character whose not Karen gets curb stomped by Calvin? Like most legends he faces are so weak despite him only recently having achieved the same number of breaks as them. They're are far far too weak, like they gave no thought to how to balance their stats.

Not to mention the hyprocrisy of kala slaughtering 50k innocent soliders and then chastening Calvin for beating up a bully. I still don't get how none of them are affected by the morality ofkilling 50k soliders. Like none of them are psychopaths and they dont view ulsians as subhumans, so how can they without any regards to morality kill 50k people just to trigger a break?

***** She didn't care about calvin bullying a bully, but about him indulging in his mild psychopathy (i.e. visibly enjoying hurting someone), which is admittedly not only a bad trait for a wizard king to have, but to be seen to have.

Also, there is an explanation about why even legends don't have optimized stats: no one except for royals can count on having multiple breaks, so they optimize for the present. An example is that a royal can casually decide to invest almost all their warp points in their first 4 breaks to body or mind, which increases the amount of warp they'll have next time, and so on, cumulatively. So 4 break royal can have 30-40 mind or body, which gives them 30-40 warp on their 5th break. On the other hand a commoner will have to have specialized for survival and treated each break as if it were their last. So at their 5th break they will have half the warp that a noble will, which gimps them and their power tremendously.

Besides that, I agree with you that powers in that story are not being exploited by opponents properly.

And noone so far, has had any power that made us think-wow how did he get that except for karen. Everyone else has a straightforward power, no creativity or uniqueness involved (unless they on are on Calvins team). For example look how useless every archer is except for Calvins childhood archer friend. He doesn't have any secret abilities, nor even alot of breaks until like 20 chapters ago. But he was curb stomping every enemy archer he came acrross because they have no brains and only people on calvins team do.

Furthermore, you look at dupdomacy, where Calvin is the first guy to think of cloning very dangerous materials-come on man. How is that possible when other characters are munchkining as they should be in a rational world.

This kinda ignores my whole point of how slaughtering 50k people is ignored by... well everyone. Nobody thinks about the moral repurcussions, noone even cares. Which makes NO sense.

Remember this is the calvin that decided to not destroy that Gadvoran silk cloth's maker's livelyhood by only selling his silk after leaving godvoran.

And she was /still/ wiping the floor with Calvin most of the time, at least up until he got out of the funnel. There's a reason why Calvin's refused to get any perks for Chained Spirit that might maybe give her access to some Bent; she'd make him her bitch almost immediately.

​

One legion not their entire army, it makes no sense to send 50k soldiers to retake a castle with 1k troops, specially when the rulers wanted to keep the entire thing a secret.

​

My only problem with it was that calvin needed to get some more push back on that, at least for lamp shading purposes. But they were enemy combatants, so killing them is relatively acceptable in most people's mind.

​

The number is irrelevant, they are enemies and would gladly kill him given the chance, which they ended up doing by throwing him in the hole technically. It's not optimal or something a good guy would do but calvin was never a good guy.

*********** I'm not saying it wasn't evil. Enemy combatant doesn't entail they are in the wrong, just that they are /his/ enemies and that they are combatants instead of civilians.

It's totally in his character to do so, he's always been a psychopath. It's stated quite often, just after he captures Nadia or whatever the illitian princess name is, there's a very big focus on how he makes her horny /because/ he's a sadistic psycho. She even asks his archer friend about his childhood and he tells her about how he manipulated people, tortured other kids and animals, and how he's been getting better thanks to Kala.

But he's still a psychopath, it's in his genes, he doesn't care. It's an inherent trait of his, he can learn to be better and conditioned to act in a more social manner via incentives other than ethics, which is also clearly stated and demonstrated frequently as to how he doesn't feel bad about hurting people, but actually by Kala or somebody he cares about being angry at him if he does.

It's a genuine trait he possesses, it seems to me that you've seen him be kind a few times and assumed he was a good guy. He isn't, he's an evil wizard king taking over the world by force. That's the entire story.

PS. It's also implied that he only did that because Elliot manipulated him, there's a conversation between Elliot and Nadia, where she asks him if he doesn't know this entire 'make trouble in Ulessis arc' is bad and going to make Calvin hated. Elliot replies that's his goal, that he wants Calvin to experience being despised and hated as a part of his growth / education.

It's a spinoff focused on the mass media club (don't think they've been introduced yet in 108) that, while not /quite/ as clever as the original, is still pretty funny. Much shorter as well; the chapters are only a couple pages long, so not much of a commitment.

** I've generally found comic books to be the least rational medium. Lots of "I'm losing but will just really try hard now and say something cool and now I've won". The latest X-Men mini series though, House of X and Powers of X, is probably the most rational mainstream story I've read (or at least has the most things I first saw in rational fiction. I wont give spoilers, but there is at the very least some hard-core munchkining of powers). Art looks great as well, and there's not a tonne of background needed to get it (I hadn't read an X-Men comic in about a decade). You can get a free trial week on Marvel Unlimited, the digital platform. Can reccomend checking it out.

** Recommending Hardcore history, specifically the Mongol Empire series. It's really good, Genghis Khan is this green eyed, red haired, 6ft tall asian man, munchkin all over asia in the 13th century. It's almost like an anime.

​

Most people today think of him as a monster because of outdated history, and made up stories from the renaissance. (Basically writers, at the time, used the mongols and Genghis Khan in place of their own kings and rulers when they were criticizing them, so the idea of them as evil monsters permeates even today in our culture).

​

He wasn't exactly a good guy, but still it's really fun, seeing this ex slave revolutionize warfare, city planning, commerce, creating writing system for his language and kind of accidentally conquering the world.

​

I listened to it years ago, and I still think of it often, it's one of my favorite things ever.

I'm pretty sure George Carlin himself addresses the astronomical amount of genocide Genghis Khan did and how favorable Western history has been to him. Being a "barbarian", world domination, the silk road and Pax Mongolica are what he's known for, not the genocide. I also don't recall him ever being enslaved?

**** I've also read newer books on him, and more recent historical discoveries have been made since that episode. It's highly implied, in our main historical source of his life, that when he was 'arrested' for the murder of his brother he was made into a 'slave' for an indeterminate amount of time, until he escaped.

Things like razing a city that wouldn't surrender, so other cities would be more likely to surrender in the future generally decreases the total number of casualties in the long run. it's kind of rational, if quite cold.

Same with killing all the leadership and their families, while also installing his own leaders and marrying them to the daughters and widows of previous leaders. It solidifies his control and staunches potential future rebellions led by distant relatives of past rulers.

I wouldn't call what he did genocide, that implies targeted removal of specific people. And that's not what he did. He's responsible for a very large number of deaths, but his goal wasn't eradicating any specific groups of people. He wasn't a racist, or a religious bigot, but actually quite tolerant and open minded.

Historians generally see him favorably, the average person and our cultures interpretation of him are quite different and more focused on the negative imho.

The problem with genocide isn't that you're targeting one group, it's that you're killing a lot of people. Genghis killed a lot of people for personal gain, which is evil. It doesn't matter that it wasn't a genocide (or maybe it matters very slightly), the overwhelming part of the moral consideration here is people's lives, not whether someone was a bigot or not.

You're probably right, but it still leads to discussions on whether you believe there are levels and degrees of evil of it should be used as a blanket term and that every evil person should be seen as the same.

Personally I see responsibility for deaths in warfare as a more redeemable evil than targeted systematic killing of civilians. Whether that's rational or not is debatable and potentially an interesting discussion.

******* How is starting a war different from starting a genocide? Genghis khan didn't have some virtuous reason to conquer cities and slaughter people. (You would need an extraordinarily good reason to justify that.) He wanted more power, so he committed mass murder.

"Rape and Pillage."

I'm definitely not saying there aren't gradiations of evil. A defensive war would be less morally fraught than a campaign of conquest. But this seems like a classic near-far thinking scenario- brutal conquest, the slaughter of cities, Genghis Khan- is all very far away from us, so we have these high-minded ideas we use to approach it (system 2 thinking). Whereas racial genocide is closer to us and there are a bunch of 1st-hand stories of things like the holocaust, so it has a much more visceral effect.

That is factually incorrect and shows ignorance. He was Elected Khan of Khans, he wanted to make a trade agreement with the people he first warred with, but they killed his envoys and send their heads back to him, which in his culture was basically the biggest offense you could commit and a declaration of war.

So he did war on them, but he was so successful and brought back so much wealth and resources from a short war with virtually no losses to his people that they demanded more wars.

And so he did as his people asked, but first he always asked for tributes and offered to leave people alone if they gave his horse some hay and accepted to send him tribute once in a while. Only when they refused and attacked him did he fight them.

That's why I said he accidentally conquered the world, that wasn't his goal, he was doing what his people asked as their elected leader and even then he wanted to avoid conflict and killing as much as possible.

Most of the time when he took a city he only killed the rulers and the people responsible for refusing his demands, he left the average person alone or recruited them into his nation.

Again the average person has a completely flawed view on him and his actions. He wasn't going around mindlessly killing people that idea is based on made up stories from the renaissance.

​

PS / edit. He wasn't 'very far' his troops fought near modern day berlin, plenty of russian, polish and other relatively 'western peoples' were directly affected by his actions.

*** Here's a rec that you might not get elsewhere, but then again it's a bit dated. The classic anime Yu Yu Hakusho has a couple of tournament arcs, they total probably about 40% to half of the series. In theory it's a bout a kid who is a spirit detective, but he spends about five minutes detecting spirits and just throws down for for the rest. I enjoyed the early episodes, but they are, in content and tone, not really like the remainder of the show. if you enjoy the first tournament arc you will likely enjoy the rest of the series, some memorable characters. Many fights won through some clever trick or strategy, but not rational.

Also, in general people don't like anime dubs, and for good reason, but the dub for Yu Yu Hakuso is notably good. So is the original, but it's a legit choice.

******** It's essentially a culmination of the genre. All the tropes you're familiar with are executed well. The main character isn't evil and has some memorable relationships. The sidekick characters (introduced pretty far in) are appropriately ridiculous and genuinely amusing, but still matter for the story.

The arc structure is pretty notable. The arcs will typically culminate with something suitably epic, and then the world and the MC will be irrevocably changed. The arcs usually have their own logic and focus, there are arcs on alchemy while undercover in an enemy clan, an arc where the MC is leading a tribe across the continent, a tournament in which the MC forges a bond with a magical crate, travelling back to the past to learn lost techniques, and so on. This keeps it pretty fresh.

Finally, the battles are done well. (if you don't like battles this might not be the one for you.) The MC always has some kind of bag of tricks and will use them and the environment, or the rules around advancement in the world, to his advantage. Early on, that often means a lot of running away. Arcs are balanced, sometimes the MC is the weakest person around and needs to play things smart, sometimes he's playing in the B leagues and is the strongest...he's not always curb stomping or being weak, where he is on that spectrum is based on the context..

Anyway, enjoy, and stick it out for 20-30 chapters as the first couple are a little slow. (Oh, the pacing is a bit slower that other novels in this genre, but they're typically so breakneck that this will still seem pretty peppy.)

** Recently I've branched out into reading Naruto fanfiction, and I've found some great SI/isekai stories to enjoy.

I like when the isekai plotline /doesn't/ follow the stereotypical power-building arc wherein a baseline American civilian gets plopped down into ninja society and rapidly embarks on their transformation into the specialest snowflake with requisite powerlevel and angst quota. My suspension of disbelief especially falters when the civilian SI immediately develops a blase attitude about personally partaking in a society that churns out child soldiers and routinely commits war crimes for a living. It's a problem of balancing the desire for realism vs. canon-similar levels of action that many fanfic authors unfortunately struggle with.

Thus, my favorites tend to be stories about 'badass normal' SIs who /don't/ jump into the ninja powercreep arms race but instead use their intellect and civilian skills to make a positive mark on the world they are thrust into.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/][Sanitize]] is an excellent example that has been recommended on this sub before. It focuses on a doctor SI who, through her efforts to propagate modern medical practices, unintentionally plants the seeds of peace during the Warring States Period.

I also want to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12083631/][Great Lakes & Expectations]]. It follows an SI who was working on her Masters in International Relations before being isekaid into the world of Naruto. She gradually finds her feet in a seemingly violent society while dragged around at the whims of people who vastly outpower her. Eventually she reaches a position of security and begins to put her considerable political skill set to use, striving toward positive change despite shinobi society's inherent bias against civilians.

Somewhat less so than "native" kids sure, but that's a really long time, especially when you're pretending to be a native yourself. On top of that, you've got a pretty tempting power fantasy and the knowledge that the only way you'll be allowed to get your hands on battle wizard magic is to conform.

The fact that most SIs just buy in and go along with it is actually probably pretty realistic, though you'd expect a few internal thoughts or self-deceptions.

**** You're right that it can be realistic depending on how it's portrayed. If someone is a teenager or younger in the real world before getting isekaid, then I could see them being more open to gradual indoctrination in the value judgements of their new world. I've also seen a few fics where the SI was part of the criminal underworld or a career soldier beforehand, thus partially explaining why they are not viscerally opposed to causing suffering the way a typical person would be.

I find it less plausible when the isekaid person was an educated adult who lived 20+ years of their life in a peaceful democratic society. At that point, if the character just goes with the flow rather than trying to uphold their previous values, then the author needs to convincingly address how the character manages to justify that moral dissonance to themselves. If the character is mainly motivated by their desire to live a power fantasy, then how do they justify all the suffering compounded by acting on that selfish desire?

One example of a plausible justification might be [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18474445/chapters/43772794][In Sound Judgement]]. In that fic the SI recognizes that she has no hope of rebelling against the system while weak, so she decides to conform until she is strong enough to enact a 'fifth column' style insurrection.

Like any trope, the character's reasoning can be done well or done badly. When done well, it makes for a highly engaging story. I just get annoyed when the the justifications are so slim/nonsensical that they feel like transparently thin excuses for the author to skip to the power fantasy part of the plot.

****** Its a worse problem for Naruto inserts than most worlds, because Narutos world has one of the most pathological political setups in all of fiction.

There are worlds that are even more hellish, but mostly that is because of external factors - rampaging monsters, alien invaders, demon threat, ect.

Naruto is a hellworld entirely because its social and political structure is insanely dysfunctional. Ninjas have monopoly on magic, and by extension, a monopoly on effective force, but they do not govern, they are not united, they hold betrayal, deception and murder as active virtues, and they do very, very little with the literal goddamn keys to the universe other than murder each other and any civilian who happens to inconvenience them.

Anyone iskaied in from a functional world ought by rights to have really, really extreme aversion to.. everything.

*** A separate comment, for a separate discussion: I just went and read the first few chapters of Great Lakes & Expectations on your recommendation, and I'm pretty torn. (I'm already following Sanitize, which is great.)

On the one hand it's interesting and well-written, and I'm enjoying the story.

On the other hand, it's not translating the Japanese, which is the single most irritating quirk I've ever come across. I'm having to copy and paste entire lines into google translate. I /hate/ it.

There is a reason literally every other author writing about a foreign language ever has either written the foreign language as English with some indication it's foreign like <this>, literally just noted they're speaking a foreign language and continued to write in English, summarised what's being said, or written a throwaway line or two at most in the language and then dropped it.

How long does this go on for? If it's more than a few more chapters, I'm strongly disrecommending it for sheer obnoxiousness, unless you can read Japanese.

**** I agree that the Japanese not being translated in the early chapters was /intensely/ irritating. I kept a tab open to translate, but most of the time the translator I used didn't make much more sense beyond what was already clear from context in the fic.

Fortunately the lack of translation only lasts until the main character becomes more fluent in the language. In chapter 9 the Japanese parts switch to romaji rather than katakana/hirigana/kanji, and by chapter 10 the SI is fluent enough that all speech is presented as English (with appropriate Japanese honorifics).

I get the impression that it was an intentional stylistic choice to convey just how bewildered the SI felt during the period when she can barely understand everyone she encounters. To me the overall quality of the fic is great enough that I'd recommend pushing through the untranslated parts - especially because everything important in those first 9 chapter is conveyed by context and the bits that the SI manages to puzzle out in her thoughts.

**** Yeah I'm going to second that it's super annoying to have to translate the Japanese, particularly when the main character does actually understand at least a little bit of it, and /especially/ when the only parts in Japanese are the parts she *actually understands*.

Geez, it's almost intentionally annoying.

Edit: that being said the story is pretty worthwhile so far, I just wish the author would translate the Japanese into English

** More like the opposite of Rational, but I want to recommend Tiger King, which recently came out on Netflix and is immensely popular.

Almost everyone involved is a grade A asshole, and I for one went back and forth for a bit on who was the worst among them. However, it makes for some good chitchatting with others who have watched it. Did X kill Y? Is A sanctimonious? Is B a bigger dick than C?

Edit: My first controversial comment on [[/r/rational]]. Exciting.

*** It's not fanfiction, but redemption/second chances is a big theme in [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]]. Basically every character in the main cast has either done something they're trying to atone for, or are struggling with having had something done to them that they need to learn to live with, and frequently both.

It's not rational, not like Worm was a de- and reconstruction of the Superhero genre, but a lot of stuff that seems unrealistic at first is justified later on.
