** Jehan the Wise, who +hung+ hanged seven Princes and one, was a Callowan King. Cat's letter has a jump in causality that the average person probably couldn't put together, but that suggests that there's an underlying Story that Catherine is hinting at, but I'm not sure what:

Theodosius, first Tyrant of the League, invades Procer and wins victory after victory. Isabella the Mad leads Proceran troops and fights numerous losing battles of attrition to weaken the Tyrant, eventually goading Theodosius into believing his own myth and committing to a battle with terrible odds in his favor that he loses horribly and ends him. Then, twenty years later, a Callowan King invades Procer and hangs seven Princes and one.

What does the latter have to do with the former? Is it a backlash for Isabella's strategy of giving us land and battles to Theodosius to weaken him? Isabella essentially sacrificed all those lives and those of the commoners in the name of strategy, and Jehan the Wise, the Good King, eventually came along to exact retribution against the Princes who did not defend their people.

It's obvious that Cat is drawing a parallel between herself and Theodosius, saying that she'll only weaken herself the more she wins and that there's a real danger of her buying into her own mythos and pushing herself too far. Hence the surrender, wherein she's sidestepping Theodosius's blunder. Does that make Pilgrim the equivalent of Isabella the Mad, then? He said last chapter that he was purposefully sending in his soldiers to die in order to increase the Narrative weight behind his miracle--that same sort of sacrificial pragmatism that Isabella used. So does Cat then expect a third party, namely Kairos, to come in and balance the scales for her; I mean, Kairos literally just found a bunch of Proceran Princes this chapter.

*** I think the implication is just that Isabella knew she outnumbered Theodosius and so committed to a strategy of attrition where she gave up 2-4 soldiers for every one that Theodosius gave up, and so was able to beat him even though he had the weight of his Name and narrative behind him.

The problem is that she was so focused on beating the enemy in front of her, she didn't consider that sapping her country's military might made her vulnerable to other players on the stage, and then Callow came in and walloped the weakened Procer.

I'm not sure the timeline makes a ton of sense for that - 20 years /should/ be enough for a nation to recover its military manpower, unless the war against Theodosius really, really, critically drained Procer of its supply of able bodied adult men.

I think she's simply saying that Callow and Procer should work together to thump Kairos rather than fight it out amongst each other and then let Kairos mop up what's left, but Kairos' comments about the metaphysical implications of Masego creating a new, unclaimed domain adjacent to Creation suggest there are broader implications.

**** It was way more than 4 proceran soldier for one soldier than Helike. He """"lost""" the maddened field with over 100K overall casulties, and since it was impossible to lose 20K soldiers (it's a route, you can't retreat in good order in such a case), it means that the death ratio is more likely 1-6 or even higher. And it was only one battle. The attrition battle before may have been even worst for Procer.

**** You are assuming everything went hunky dory after the Maddened Field. Procer was a wreck already with multiple princedoms already eviscerated and now even more dead. 100k dead on that one battlfield with months of fighting in the southern provinces before hand to get Theodosius to that point under Isabella's control. Add on a few months more of him slapping the princes around and you have one pretty terrible war.

Procer probably devolved into open warfare for a time.

**** It's two separate narratives she's referencing. First, it's exactly what you've mentioned - avoiding a war of attrition when another enemy (the dead king) is on the horizon, with the implication that the Legion and the Crusade are playing the parts of the participants in the Maddened Field. But it's important to note that the victor which came later is Callowan, who came and sacked a weakened Procer. It's not just a caution against exhausting the troops and losing men in a fight which will have more long-term negative consequences, it's a message that Cat expects the Tyrant to attack the Procerans and for her to be able to ride in later for an ultimate victory.

I will have to quote someone about it:

#+begin_quote
  “Isabella the Mad's book?” she asked, voice rough.

  “She was the only one to ever defeat Theodosius on the field,” the diplomat said.

  “That's, uh, a very generous assessment of the Maddened Fields,” General Basilia said, and tried to pass her convulsive laughter for a cough.
#+end_quote

For reminder, Helike has 40K soldiers. We don't really know how much the population grows over time, so let's say Theodosius had the same.

​

For the Maddened Fields killing over 100K soldiers with Helike still being able to "retreat in good order" means that Theodosius never, ever "lost horribly". He just said "she is too crazy, i'm fucking out of there" and went back. He lost politically (he couldn't annex the territory), but from a military perspective, it was an overwhelming victory.

***** 1. When we compare the respective size, I'm not sure that Theodosius is the USA and Procer the Vietnam... It's more like Alexander the Great vs Persia where Persia would have tried an attrition strategy.
2. Losing the war is different from losing the battle, especially "horribly". Theodosius lost the war because he couldn't continue it. It doesn't mean he lost somewhere specifically. That's the whole point of " /A hundred battles, even victories, will always lose you the war." + "/ /the First Prince asked of her when she expected the war to be brought to a successful conclusion. ‘It should take,' she famously replied, ‘about a hundred battles.'”/ The Maddened Fields weren't a military defeat for him, despite Isabella saying so.

  “Here's a secret for you, Adjutant,” the Tyrant of Helike whispered, leaning closer. “The thing that waits for you in the depths of Liesse stolen isn't just your friend.

#+end_quote

So do you think the Hierarch has some sort of necromantic powers that will let him raise the souls of those sacrificed by Diabolist at Liesse in order for them to hold a tribunal and pass judgement on /everyone/?

Oh, that reminds me: Diabolist was experimenting on the Watch and the Fae way back when, and they learned that the Watch gets their powers from a gestalt comprised of all their ancestor's souls, an entity that Hierophant called a god. Also, Cat assigned Hierophant to work with the Daoine in order to undo whatever Diabolist did to them, so he's got prior expertise with it. Add to that his interest in Ascension, the, it's obvious what he's doing with the ruins of Liesse in Arcadia--he's forging, or reusing, the souls that Diabolist sacrificed into a gestalt in order to ascend.

Not sure if you're correct. The souls are the "blotting out the sky" kind of visible, and Akua needed over a dozen captives from the Watch to summon them - a liability that Hierophant has personally shored up. You're right in the sense that the shape is there: if Cat had actually become the Black Queen, she wouldn't go to the Everdark - she would exalt the souls of her ancestors.

That said, the princes are definitely about to run into the Hierarch: they have all the cavalry and the Tyrant only has his personal guards and a bunch of gargoyles to hold them back. They are about to turn into a mob, and the only hope is that Cat will manage to spare Rosala by ratting out Kairos' collusions with all those foreign tyrants and having Anaxares execute him instead.

*** I think "other friend of mine that will get his due" refers to Keter's Due, where sorcery can't be perfectly efficient. Hierophant is working an incredibly large sorcery in the ruins of Liesse he pulled to Arcadia. It's possible the destructive excess that is Keter's Due will only be released when that chunk of Arcadia reaches Creation, unless Cat and Tyrant win and can turn their attention to Arcadia to stop it.
