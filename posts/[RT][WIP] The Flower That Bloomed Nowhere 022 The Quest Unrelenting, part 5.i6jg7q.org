The final part of the first act of the first arc? Pfft, it doesn't sound very impressive when I put it that way, to be honest.

This chapter was the hardest to write so far, and I'm still not entirely happy with how it flows, but it'll have to do. This is probably, in a weird sort of way, kind of a make-or-break point for the story, although I imagine anyone not in it for the long haul realistically dropped off much earlier. If you're not drawn in by the end of this one, though, then there are definitely some more fundamental problems with my tone and pacing, and the whole slow burn approach might've been misguided.

Regardless, if you've stuck with it so far, thank you so much for reading!

so this was an interesting chapter. I admit I got kind of lost on some of the politics since it's been a while since I started the fic and I already had trouble keeping track of some of it - but I enjoyed the heated discussion.

I was confused why Lilith called Su a 'murderer' - the implication being that all arcanists are - why?

Anyway, looks like some real mystery stuff is finally starting, looking forward to it!

This is something that's probably possible to guess at this point, but only if you've been paying pretty close attention to a bunch of specific details in the story. Likewise for the whole sequence with Su at the end of the chapter.

I'm kinda second-guessing myself a bit in my original choice to not outright explain parts of the worldbuilding and the main dilemma of the protagonist, but instead have it be revealed slowly over the course of the first arc. My hope was that it would add to the intrigue of the mystery - which really starts from the very first chapter - and preserve a lot of pacing and tonal buildup that would be lost otherwise. I wanted to capture the feeling of slowly unwrapping a really awful present.

I'm not sure how well it's worked, though?

**** Unwrapping a really awful present is a great way to put it, and it's a big part why I'm enjoying the story. I did a re-read to remember the stuff I read months ago, gonna take a stab at figuring some things out.

The method for becoming an arcanist (specifically, becoming able to use the Power) involves another person dying. Bardiya says that he couldn't cast because he hadn't gone through a recognition ceremony, and his circumstances suggest that the ceremony is a hard requirement and not a tradition.

Maybe the recognition part of the ceremony means more than just "recognized as an arcanist"? Could the ceremony involve an intentional prosognostic event?

Also, I wonder if this is a /secret/ to the general population. We don't get to know what Ptolema's question was going to be, but what if it was something along the lines of "Is she an arcanist?" or "Is she in the know?". Mehit isn't an arcanist, but since she's Lilith's mother, she might have had to been given an explanation.

Utsu's acclimation log seems to be a standard item, even if she isn't using it as intended. Maybe the recognition ceremony involves somehow supplanting or (metaphorically) consuming another person? Utsu's litany is possibly how she answered those prompts before her recognition ceremony. Post-ceremony, the typical usage of the log would be to track how much association you have with those statements, to make sure the original person is still in control, with expected answers being on the high range instead of the low range.

Utsu seems to be using it the opposite way, keeping track of a vestige in hopes that it can be one day resscurected. Which would mean that our narrator isn't the original Utsu, but the person who has supplanted her. So who is the narrator if that's the case?

My best guess is that Utsu's grandfather tried to copy either himself or a dead loved one over to Utsu's body, with the help of Samium's Egomancy.

I'm leaning towards himself, although a version of himself that's more like the core of the person as opposed to a perfect copy complete with memories. The narrator thinks of Utsu's grandfather as a seperate person, and that the relation between the two of them is weird. A successor fits that much more cleanly than a perfect copy.

I'm having trouble figuring out how much of Utsu's situation is because of whatever her grandfather did, and how much is because of the recognition ceremony. The most straightforward guess would be that her grandfather's actions caused the ceremony to go wrong, leaving the wrong ego in charge of the body instead of the original Utsu?

I think the thing that's confusing me is that there are multiple layers to this. Thinking about it in terms of what Ran knows, Utsu's grandfather did /something/ to Utsu, and so she decided to work with Utsu to get invited into the Order so that they could do /something/ (and that /something/ isn't finding Samium since they didn't know he was there until recently).

But Ran (and everyone else) don't know the whole truth. So what's the difference between what Ran thinks happened and what actually happened, and what's the difference between why Ran thinks they're here and why they're actually here? Not confident enough to guess on that yet.

That's all I've got for now. I'm satisfied with the broad strokes but I think I'm still missing an important portion. I had a lot of fun (and stayed up way too late) getting my thoughts in order about this. For what it's worth, I've always appreciated putting together the slow trickle of information so I'm glad you wrote it this way.

Some other thoughts on the story:

Why is Utsu's grandfather's name blacked out? Utsu can see the name just fine, so it doesn't seem like a mental block. Unless it's a mental block that also blocks you realizing that something is wrong?

Who left the note in Utsu's book? Nindar could have just told Utsu his concerns if it were him. Sacnicte is the obvious guess, but I don't think there's a way to rule out anyone yet.

It's impossible to say without a wider sample, but the class has more conditional or even missing resistances that I would have guessed, especially considering that militaries can be picky enough to turn away even soldiers with less than perfect resistances. Utsu's compromised neurological resistance makes sense but there are at least four with less than solid M and two with less than solid A. As far as I can tell we haven't learned why any of those characters might have less than AMN resistances, but thinking about it that's probably pretty personal business that Utsu wouldn't know or ask about.

Also, resistances and how they work in combat is a pretty cool system.

It was a bit odd reading a discussion about meritists now that the context has been removed. I would have been fine if I hadn't read the info from the previous version, but now I'm going in with half-remembered details I can't go back and check. Honestly I still think you made the right call in removing it though.

Overall, the tension is nice and high and I'm very interested in seeing where all of this goes.

***** Wow, this is really in-depth speculation! It's obvious you've thought about the story a lot. I'm very flattered by your interest!

I feel like this deserves a more extensive reply, but obviously, I can't say too much at this point given the content of the post. However, to address a few things specifically:

#+begin_quote
  and so she decided to work with Utsu to get invited into the Order so that they could do something (and that something isn't finding Samium since they didn't know he was there until recently).
#+end_quote

Could you elaborate a little bit on the conclusion you've drawn here? I ask because it makes me worried I might've made a mistake or created an unintentional impression through the process of doing the edits, since you're taking something here as a given that wasn't intended by me to be.

#+end_quote

I'll clarify this one, since I thought it was made clear by the narration, but I guess it's a little too vague. Utsushikome is deliberately withholding the name from the reader/refusing to acknowledge it, despite the fact that she and the other characters can see it just fine.

It was a bit of a tough call to remove it - the problem with a story in a limited setting like this is that there's a lot of exposition that /needs/ to happen by certain beats in the narrative, or else they'll just fall flat due to the reader not understanding the terminology or context, but only so much space for them. I really wanted to have the basics of political terminology in this setting clarified by the time of this chapter, but there wasn't really a point that I could do it where it didn't feel clunky or slow the story down, which is why I ended up removing that section.

My hope is that people will be willing to just accept only understanding the broad strokes of this part as it is now until further expansion is given later. I'm sorry that the change messed up the experience for you personally, though! Editing a serial is always something done for new readers then ends up being sort of at the expense of the old, which sucks - it's one of the main reasons I hemmed and hawed over changing the stuff I did.

I could upload the removed content, if you were just curious. There's nothing in there that would compromise the story.

I'm not quite taking the above as a given, just more thinking out loud. It does seem likely to me though.

In the conversation Utsu and Ran have in the cafe, Ran mentions that it's funny that her first reaction to getting invited to the Order was being annoyed, and how she'd forgotten why she wanted to get into the class in the first place. She also talks about how the thing they're working towards got dropped into her lap. I read that as their goal was to become renowned as healers to the point where they could get invited to join the Order as members, so they could do whatever it is they're trying to do. Their class getting invited to do presentations just happened to be a massive shortcut to that goal.

In Autonoe's letter (that is sent after the class is invited), it says that Samium is in the care of the Order. Ran and Utsu have been planning this for years, so they can't have been trying to get into the Order just because of this letter.

I definitely ignored some other possibilites though. They could have already known Samium was with the Order and the letter was confirmation, or maybe they just wanted to get information about Samium from the Order. Or it could just be that the goal has actually been getting something from Samium the whole time. The invite to the Order was just another thing they had to do for the class, and the lucky break was finding out that Samium was there.

Yeah I wouldn't mind re-reading it if you wouldn't mind throwing it in a paste bin.
