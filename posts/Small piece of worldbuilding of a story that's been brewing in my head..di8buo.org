After a very long reading slump I decided I should finally try my own hand at writing. I have a basic idea of a plot and main characters, what I sorely lack in at the moment is some solid worldbuilding. I don't want to make stuff up as I go and then run into inconsistency and plot-holes. I want my world to feel organic right from the start.

I've written the following in the form of a history book by a scholar as I think it makes for far more amusing reading than dry recollections of an omniscient narrator. My goal is to create a decent low fantasy rational fiction. Pointing out inconsistencies and weak spots in the setting would be very helpful.

​

Edit: Working on the story!

** One contradiction:

#+begin_quote
  Some of our elite operatives had managed to infiltrate Velargh towns and extract human slaves in addition to tomes from their libraries. A few of these slaves were considered high-caste in the Velargh society. They could write and speak their language well enough to help our scholars decipher parts of the writings.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  The only way to complete the picture is to gain access to the other races' records. That's not going to be possible in the near future. Sharena or no Sharena, a Velargh could still crush a man's wrist like snapping dry wood.
#+end_quote

This thing which at the end of the document is described as 'impossible' is clearly a thing which has been done before.

Extreme difficulty would certainly be plausible - after all, it required 'elite operatives' the first time - but it seems a bit much to call it outright /impossible/.

**** Ah, so the previously obtained books were from outlying, poorly defended villages and the real gems of knowledge are in seriously well-protected fortresses? That makes a lot more sense.

Then all the humans need their elite operatives to do is to draw up a sufficiently convincing disguise as an elite slave looking to take out an interlibrary loan...

******* u/generalamitt:
#+begin_quote
  one of the widely agreed-upon theories in academics is that Sharena not only changes the host, but also its offspring, independent of exposure to Sharena by the descendants.
#+end_quote

After four generations of exposure to Sharena humans are radically changed by it. Even if a child is raised without the insertion of any Sharena they will still have traces of it, enough that blending in with human slaves will be extremely difficult.

What they could do is employ a newly freed high caste Velargh slave. It's possible in theory but in practice extremely improbable to pull off. They would have to free a slave at an appropriate age for long and extensive training. That person would have to possess the right talent and willingness to risk their newly acquired freedom and life. The list of possible candidates is extremely short to begin with since high-caste slaves aren't easy to free

Even if they did find that individual, execution of a three-part plan- infiltration, data extraction, and escape is highly unlikely considering Velargh's tight security and capabilities.

** My biggest suggestion for you is to not worry too much about the worldbuilding. It's your first novel; it's going to have problems...but, based on what I see here , it's also going to have strengths.

Worldbuilding is fun, but it's a trap. It's all too easy to keep building forever and never actually start the story, because there's always one more thing that "absolutely must" get nailed down before you can start. Forget all that! You can revise later if you want to.

Advice #1: Put your butt in the chair, hands on the keyboard, and write the opening paragraph, right now.

Advice #2: Pick a day of the week and commit to always publishing a chapter on that day, no matter what. There will be weeks where you don't have energy for a full chapter, so you can write a short little fluff bit or omake or post some outtakes. Regardless, every single week you need to post something and link it here on /r/r.

Now hurry up! I'm anxious to start reading this thing!

*** I see your point, though /some/ worldbuilding has to be done. I can probably create stuff on the fly but after a while inconsistencies are sure to pile up. I could revise later, sure, but my plan is to post weekly chapters and build a decent-sized readership. A poor first impression would probably hurt that.

Hopefully, I won't end up with a 300K-word tome and no story to show for it. (Not that there's anything wrong with that. I can see how someone might slap on a story almost as an afterthought, and that's ok too. Just not my thing).

If I'm not mistaken, you have experience with webnovels. Where should I post my story? Would you recommend one site or multiple sites for more traffic?

**** Eh, people are surprisingly forgiving and it's surprisingly easy to write your way out of a hole. The worldbuilding that I did for The Two Year Emperor would have fit on a postcard and it was never an issue.

tl;dr I'd recommend posting on SufficientVelocity.com

Longer version:

I started off on fanfiction.net but probably won't post there again. Their interface is a complete pain and the ability to interact with readers is very limited -- they don't have threaded comments or a way to link to a specific comment, and you can't respond to comments except via PM, which means you can't respond to guest comments. Their discoverability is for ass, as search is very basic and community features are limited. Plus, they use JavaScript to disable selecting text and copying it, making it harder for people to share snippets of your work or incorporate them into comments, and harder for you to quote specific parts of a comment. On the plus side, their interface is adequate and they have the best statistics out of all the publishing sites I've tried. They tell you how many views you got per chapter, from which countries, how many comments on each chapter, and more. Also, the mods are effectively non-existent, so you can post anything you want without worrying that someone is going to get bent out of shape.

After that I tried ArchiveOfOurOwn.com, although I ended up not publishing there because their statistics were very limited and at the time that was a big deal for me. I have since decided that it's not, and AO3 has a very rich tagging system plus inline and threaded comments, so it might be a good choice.

I've never used RoyalRoad.com, but they do have built-in monetization options, which is nice. I wouldn't worry about that for a first novel, though.

Next I tried SpaceBattles.com. Avoid them; the readership is a toxic dumpster fire and the mods are capricious and hair-trigger, handing out infractions and temporary threadbans whenever their sodas get warm. Less importantly, the site is visually unappealing and the rating system is limited.

Finally, I moved to SufficientVelocity.com, another forum site. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Pros and cons:

- It has a decent sized readership
- It's easy to use, albeit minimal from a publishing standpoint
- The ability to interact with users is excellent: linking to a particular post is easy and quoting is easy (the quotes even automatically link back to the source)
- You can block abusive readers so as to not see their content
- The PM system is feature-rich
- There is an alert system for when readers reply or rate
- The rating system is nuanced
- The site is visually appealing
- The mods are active but relatively okay -- my experience has been that they are usually neither capricious nor trigger-happy. I have had only one serious negative experience with them in four years, albeit it was a doozy -- multiple days of threadlock, readers getting infracted for bullshit reasons, and a real-time inquisition that was poorly organized and exhausting despite the fact that they eventually decided I'd some nothing wrong. I note that other people report different experiences and my use of the site is mostly limited to the Marked for Death quest that I write, so take my words with a grain of salt. Also, one of the directors, EmpressSquishette, is a complete jackass who will go out of their way to cause conflict wherever they show up, but you're not likely to interact with them too often. Overall, despite the issues, I think the mods add positive value.
- You have a signature on all your posts, so word-of-mouth happens naturally if you interact with the site outside your own story.
- There are no statistics aside from total views on your thread plus total replies

You could try publishing on multiple sites at once to get more traffic, but the idea has never appealed to me. Keeping everything in sync between the various sites seems like a drag -- if I fix a typo or make a minor retcon (which you will!), I don't want to have to repost it in five different places. I find it annoying enough to keep Marked for Death in sync between the main thread and the Story Only thread.

Up to you; choice of site will not make or break the story. Only not writing will do that. :P

** Humans aren't really good cattle.. We breed and grow slowly, need a lot more calories than our sizes denote, can't really feasibly survive on a vegetarian diet without modern food preservation and trade, generally you want the animals you use for food to eat things that you can't for efficiency sake it's why we mostly don't eat carnivores, we can just eat the meat they'd eat instead.

*** That's all true but I'm not sure it can be considered a weak spot in the setting. This is the sort of stuff I am comfortable handwaving since I'm writing fantasy, which doesn't necessarily correspond to our own natural laws. I can just mention some weird biological attributes of the species that make eating humans viable. Maybe consuming human brains is somehow beneficial to them. Anyhow, It should definitely be addressed at some point in the story, thank you.

**** It's not about viability or natural laws it's about inefficiency. Using humans as cattle is comparable to silly economical systems you see in fiction sometimes.. It will annoy the people here tremendously after the first one figures it out and comments on it.

Maybe as a raid, they'd capture humans from their villages to eat their brains for some magical benefit, but raising humans as cattle, is just too silly.

** So, why not just poison the enemy water supply? Food sources? Trade routes? Guerrilla warfare type stuff..

​

It seems like it'd be easy for a motivated group of humans to completely disable the infrastructure necessary for any of these powerful sentient species societies require to function. I'd give your sentient species a couple centuries, maybe a thousand years with modern humans present, by that point extinction is pretty much a given.

We are very nasty to our enemies, even human ones, make them not human and may their god have mercy on them because we sure as frick won't.
