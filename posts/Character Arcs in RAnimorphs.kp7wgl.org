In my favorite books, there's often a sense of things coming together neatly, and beats are overloaded with significance on the levels of narrative, theme, and character (maybe others). There's a sense that things “had to” play out as they do, as events follow logically as well as challenging characters in core ways or giving expression to some interesting ideal or real-world dynamic. Things feel wholesome and complete when characters are able to fully self-actualize, or have a clear path towards doing so, and tragic when some fatal flaw or contingency bars their way. The experience is of seeing the Ellimist construct the narrative in its perfect form.

So, for me at least, there's an appeal to going super tight, everything fitting together at a thematic/narrative arc level. Done poorly, this can feel pat or cheesy. The main failure modes are making things too explicit (the connections are more resonant when formed in the mind of the reader, or even when reading analysis; plus, pacing) or letting narrative drive events at the expense of the story's internal logic (damaging suspension of disbelief at the critical moment, reminding the reader they're reading an authored story, as opposed to viewing a perfect platonic world).

I hope this provides some perspective on where I'm coming from in what follows, and why I am motivated to look at things from this angle.

During this reading I was mostly focused on emotional/psychological character arcs, but other readings would be good too, for example looking more closely at your exploration of coordination problems, or studying the banners carried by the various characters/factions and what the character interactions say about the broader structural dynamics.

So, for each character, we ask: what is the main conflict, and whether they ultimately grow to overcome it, or if they fail to, or if they lack the time to do so (thus failing to complete an arc)? Sometimes the point will be that something doesn't get resolved, but it's good to make those choices intentionally, and maybe highlight what it is about the character or their circumstances that prevents them from growing.

I recently read through the story trying to pay particular attention to each character's

- important scenes
- internal conflicts
- attentional focus
- chief competence

Most of the time this ended up being tedious and I just read the story as a story, and some of the characters I wasn't able to really get a grip on, but here are my thoughts. For some (maybe all) of the characters, I expect you'll have a different take, so I present all of this as demonstrating the approach I'm going in with as a reader. If I were to be so bold as to give a recommendation, it would be to read this, forget it, and do the analogous thing based on your superior understanding of the characters and the world (modulo considerations of how tight you want to go, and how much space you have before the end of the story).

(I noticed that it was a lot easier to draw straight lines before the Ventura disaster. Things were so simple, once :P)

*Jake*

Despite his being a leader, Jake gives me a bit of a Samwise Gamgee vibe, somehow, in that he's rather humble and has incredible resilience. He has a deep social understanding, which I'll refer to as “empathy”. At some point the word “parliamentarian” came to mind and stuck. By this I mean that he skillfully navigates competing interests and perspectives, bringing them to a useful synthesis.

Jake seems to initially share Rachel's desire for victory, as seen by the energy and near-excitement he displays in Chapter 7, but this is worn down as he confronts the horror of his situation and comes to see victory not as a goal but as burdening responsibility.

I see Jake's core narrative to be an exploration of empathy, the burden of emotional labor, and (to my surprise) trauma.

In the first chapter, we see that Jake is constantly analyzing those around him, situating everyone and seeking understanding. To me, his experience reads as very cognitive: he remains centered, there isn't much description of embodied emotion, etc.

Next, in Chapter 7, we learn more about his powers of prediction. If we take Jake to be a real human, and his “black box” prediction algorithm to be non-magical, we conclude that Jake is either extremely empathetic (modeling others from the inside, with high fidelity) or sociopathic (having a high capacity for social manipulation, without himself feeling the pull of social or moral considerations).

Jake generally seems to take an approach of analysis over feeling, and of seeking legible understanding. His internal narrative doesn't reflect much on morality, which is probably because he's quickly pushed into the role of shepherding his team towards victory, a burden he accepts without much complaint. He displays an unselfconscious recognition that one ought to do what's right (I think?). He seems to truly care for Cassie, his brother, and Marco. He is not notably self-interested or narcissistic.

I come to the conclusion that Jake is in some sense deeply and maturely good. His social dexterity isn't sociopathy (though that would be a nice twist on Marco's statement that in David they had found another Jake), but empathy.

What of my impression that Jake's narration seems based in the head rather than the heart? Or that his predictions feel like a black box, rather than felt and understood?

I reconcile this tension by positing that Jake has a high propensity to attend to and model others, and a deep empathy based on modeling perspectives with high detail, but that his deficits in introspection and tendency to repress pain cause him to have little access to the internal mechanics of his social models. This is exacerbated by the traumas he faces over the course of the story.

Jake comes out of the gate strong, managing the team and leading them to an early win: finding the yeerk pool. But everything changes for him when he gets inside, when he encounters a scene he describes as “Auschwitz-level bad.”

Essentially, he can't hold the pain. Indeed, the horror robs him of his capacities as a perspective taker, and he can't comprehend Marco's exhortations that it's a bad idea to stay in the pool, or (as he would usually do) take Marco's words under advisement and find a third option. Instead, he doubles down on the mission, saying things like “We're going to make them pay for this... Now. Tonight. This can't be allowed to continue.” The book's structure emphasizes his dissociation: until he enters the pool, we see things from his perspective; afterwards we see things from Marco's. The mission ends in disaster, and Jake dies.

Below, I read this pattern of avoiding the overwhelming pain of empathy into the rest of his journey so far:

When morph!Jake recovers from his coma, we see the first clear case in which Jake suppresses his emotional turmoil in order to fulfil his responsibility in managing the group. Specifically, he's freaking out about being a “fake Jake” (and having died), but needs to repress this and deal with social considerations such as Ax having just pulled a gun.

Just as he begins feeling comfortable in his position, he is thrown into a deeper horror: the death of Cassie and the destruction of ventura. He describes his failure to check in with Ax as being a consequence of being burdened by pushing away his grief and being occupied with thinking about how to keep the group together -- he fails to consider what things are like for Ax, something he would have realized under other circumstances. When he wakes up, he again prioritizes strategic issues over emotional ones, dealing with the aftermath of Temrash having infested Ax and leaving his brother in a forcefield.

It is to be expected, if Jake numbs himself in response to pain, that he will be the most numb when thinking of Cassie, after her death. And so, Jake's interactions with his stored copy of Cassie provide another example of the degradation of his access to empathy, and the coincident diminishment in his capacity to take on alternative perspectives. When he talks with her, he is cold and derisive, and can only understand her point of view in terms of what she fails to understand. He can't get out of his own head and actually grasp where she's coming from.

Through these ~2.5 points, I draw a line: Jake's capacity for prediction is based on his empathy and capacity to implicitly adopt the perspective of others; in the presence of great suffering (others or his own), he dissociates from his felt emotions; in dissociating, he 1) adopts a manager/protector role that holds himself separate from the group and avoids connection and 2) loses access to some of the information his empathy would track and some of his ability to understand others' perspectives.

As for Tobias, /burden/ is a core aspect of Jake's experience, but where Tobias' burden is of living up to his own standard, Jake sees his burden as being externally imposed, both by the fates putting him in a position of existential importance and of his teammates overly relying on him, not being balanced or reasonable in the way he knows to be necessary. As a result, Jake's burnout process seems to me to be deeper and more miserable.

At our current place in the story, Jake has pretty much burned out completely, and even after what progress we've seen in his relationship to Marco, he's in a pretty bad place. His embracing of the plan to blow up the Earth stands in notable contrast to his post-Ventura revelation about unilateralism, so we're seeing either a trauma-fueled regression or the approach of a higher synthesis.

Of all of the characters, my reading of Jake offers the clearest foreshadowing of a mature final form. In this arc, we would see Jake grow to be less dissociated from his empathy, with more access to what it feels like on the inside of those he models -- less of a feeling that his prediction mechanism is a black box. He will be able to bear the pain of being in touch with his empathy, without being overwhelmed or fused with it -- capable of seeing a horror like that at the pool without being driven to despair. He will be able to see those around him, more deeply, as real people, rather than as resources he needs to manage. When someone has a different perspective from him, the chief importance of his understanding of their perspective will not be that it offers him a lever to move them, but will at a deeper level inform his own thinking and valuation.

He gets there by getting over his traumas. Namely:

- the harsh shock of horror upon seeing the inside of the pool (and dying)
- Cassie dying (and thus abandoning him to war
- the drawn out, lonely, slavery of working to hold the team together.

(P.S. My reading seems to imply that he has some prior trauma or dissociative cause (since even in the first two chapters he didn't seem especially emotional and already thought of his predictions as black-box-y) but it's probably too late to introduce something like that to the story.)

*Marco*

As I've said before, Marco holds the place of the standard Rationalist protagonist: he's quick thinking, utilitarian, good at analysis, and focused on Actually Trying to do the rational thing.

As for weaknesses, in Chapter 1, Macro shows fear, doubt, and indecision. Events are outside the scope of his expectations, and he isn't really “game”. (Not ultimately relevant, I think.) Jake notes at the end that Marco is falling into a callous, coldness. (Definitely relevant.)

In Chapter 2, Marco talks about one of his problems as being “digging up splinters,” continuing to think and generate ideas past the point where this is useful. It seems like you're setting up a narrative of training his cleverness to actual usefulness. I couldn't especially draw a line between this and future conflict; growth happens on this front, but invisibly.

In the same chapter, however, we see another conflict, one he runs into again and again: believing (often correctly) that he is the best reasoner in the group, and having trouble getting others to go along with his conclusions. He tells everyone not to test out the morphing power, but they do it anyway (with varying degrees of precaution; some relatively decent). He responds with derision, coldness, and a touch of cruelty. Indeed, this dynamic, whereby he stands in judgement of others and holds his thinking above theirs, seems to be his core emotional narrative.

Marco's mindset is cast into relief in the first pool disaster:

- Marco goes along with Jake's plan to enter, despite his misgivings. He makes a few comments about how Jake ought not to feel justified, if he turns out to be right.
- "I made a mental note to get him out of morph a few minutes early, then realized I was being dumb and just told him."

  - Demonstrates that he has a tendency to hold everything in his own head, managing his teammates rather than trusting them.

- He is ultimately “right” that the mission was too risky and he pretty much saves the day by joining Jake, getting Jake to morph, and giving orders to Rachel.

  - It isn't simply that Marco should “trust others more” or “be less arrogant”. He's right about a lot of stuff.

- When he realizes the extent to which things went wrong, he thinks of the disaster in terms of him making the mistake of letting himself be convinced to go along with it.

So we see here that Marco fundamentally frames his error as being a failure to exert control and have things go the way he wanted them to. We also know that his flaw is that he doesn't take people seriously enough. So what is the synthesis of those two things that he can learn and grow into, that also doesn't diminish the True Fact that he's a smart guy who sometimes sees important things that others don't?

We don't see too much growth along this dimension, though he does gain respect for Rachel as time passes. Making copies of himself also reflects the general esteem he holds for his own capacities, over others (as loosely/thematically contrasted to Tobias creating more morphers). On the Arn planet, he reflects on how making more of himself was falling into the same error as Cassie, which shows a little bit of humility.

As time passes, we see the way his attitude has put pressure on his dearest relationship and on the overall function of the team. It's a bit hard to describe, and doesn't exactly fit, but I'll coerce it into my frame below:

- Marco trusts his own reasoning over that of others, and also considers this to grant him a sort of moral superiority or deep betterness (demonstrated by the coldness and derision that he expresses towards people making errors of rationality).
- He lacks the skill or authority to lead the team, so he defers this role to Jake.
- However, Jake is among those he treats as inferior. Marco doesn't trust Jake's reasoning. He forces Jake to make the calls, but also kind of holds himself above Jake. There's a bit of the flavor we see from Rachel's perspective after the pool fiasco, where Marco doesn't feel it's worth the hassle of explaining things to her.\\

  - In this way, he holds himself back a bit and doesn't fully engage with Jake as an equal, taking a sort of “this is out of my hands; my irrational boss is just going to make whatever crazy choice, I guess” stance, bailing on discourse whenever Jake wants to do something based on intuition.
  - Marco also encourages and supports Jake, sometimes. He's not just, like, an awful person or an entirely terrible friend.

Neatly, Marco's core flaw has aligned with an important current conflict in the story. Now we can see him move past this, finding a way to treat his teammates as equals and also fully bring himself in relation to them (rather than holding his judgements silently, or expressing them caustically in a way that isn't really communication but rather an attack).

Finally, if there's space we should probably see something about his relationship with his dad, who has been a nonentity in the story. It seems like you almost have to tie this in somehow, now that Marco's mom is back and since both she and Marco can share/see other angles on living with a yeerk (which played into Marco's deep feeling of betrayal, previously).

*Tobias*

In Chapter 1, Tobias is the first to move towards Elfangor. I interpret him as being the first to viscerally grasp the urgency and importance of what's happening. Jake says something about Tobias having a “black desperation”. For some unclear reason, Tobias is extremely emotionally affected by Elfangor's death. (He wasn't actually Tobias' dad, was he?)

He embodies a self-understood doing-what's-right that disregards social norms and received frames; a clear-vision regarding scale and importance, not founded on analysis; and of course, loyalty. He seems concerned with principles, but I'm not sure to what extent this is just a consequence of having to make things legible in his relationship to Garrett.

When I think of Tobias' orientation to the Good, I see him as basically wanting to follow the Categorical Imperative of being a good citizen in the game of life (as shown by his early acknowledgement that the destruction of earth may be “exactly what the galaxy needs”). He doesn't have the same empathetic morality that Cassie has, Rachel's deep group affiliation and feelings of protectiveness, or the Marco-perspective of taking rational actions given values -- he just wants to do what's Right (even if it's hard).

Tobias, like Marco and Jake do in their own ways, has a clear trust/cooperation dynamic to his story: he initially lives in a world of in-group and out-group (him and Garrett vs. all of the full-of-shit adults and kids who Don't Get It -- making him seem like a “trust is slow and deep”-type pokemon), and his first big action is unilateralist, abandoning the group; but he's also the one to save Ax (expanding the team), reach out to the government, and do recruitment. He accepts a shard of Terra, extending trust and adopting the New Way of cooperation. This is some interesting complexity that feels like it has gone ~entirely un-explicated thus far. I'm not sure where this is going, but at minimum it could be tied together as an exploration on the extension of trust.

Like Rachel, Tobias has a bias towards action. While for Rachel this follows from rage and a desire for victory, for Tobias this is a mind-ecological consequence of the pressure he places on himself to meet his standards and his general sense of urgency (in turn related deep sense that things “aren't okay”/”won't just work out on their own”). It's fair to say that he's kind of impulsive (leaving the group, revealing things to Paul after seeing the Ellimist, giving up Than to Tyagi, etc.). Maybe we'll see some growth here, now that his urgency is a bit less weird and fucked up (post-dolphins and Terra).

There's been an apparent trend wherein Tobias' orientation towards + urgency regarding the Good has been revealed as fake or deluded. Namely his desire to save Temrash is revealed as a mask on suicidality (tying back to “black desperation”), and at one point Tobias wonders to what extent his principles are just a happy story he told to Garrett and then had to live up to. I hope we can get something that pushes in the other direction. There's something beautiful about Tobias and Garrett making each other into better and stronger people, but it's lame and disappointing if they've bootstrapped on the basis of Garrett taking rules seriously and Tobias being too scared of letting him down -- rather than bootstrapping from a core goodness on both of their parts, with the above stuff acting as buttressing.

There's also maybe something interesting going on with legibility and accepting groundlessness going on, which I haven't been able to tie together.

- “We're the type of people who do the right thing, even if it's hard” and other principles he shares with Garret.
- Generally not focused on analysis or the need to obsessively self-justify.
- His breakdown in front of Paul always sticks in mind as a big scene for him, and it's around the deepening acknowledgement of his lack of control, the futility of explicit planning and clever schemes. However he's clearly freaking out about it at that point.
- His recent development has been framed around “letting go,” “loosening up,” and sharing control.

It seems like there's some post-rationalist thing here about nebulosity and form: feeling confident in self-understanding and intuitions about what's right, and making local moves without a psychological need for a totalizing world-model complete to first principles.

Finally, I'd be interested in looping back to Tobias' and Garrett's discussion of copies and identities. The conversation felt unfinished, and Tobias' thinking may have changed after he died that one time and Garrett brought him back.

*Cassie*

I see Cassie as defined by the following:

- Deep compassion (different from “empathy,” which is Jake's domain)
- Deep anxiety, fear, and self-hatred regarding her own goodness
- Deep love of animals
- Deep desire for freedom, in the sense of “release” (maybe reaching: wants to be a horse to feel powerful and free of her mental prison?)

In the first chapter, Cassie mainly reacts with fear (at the end, Jake refers to her terror). She also notes wanting to save animals other than humans, which seems like a key aspect to her character but I'm not sure there's any situation where that is plot relevant.

Fear of danger doesn't seem particularly key to Cassie, but she does seem driven by her fear that she is not a good person. One might say that this isn't fear, but simple depression and negative self-image, but I think fear is apt: there's a distinct lack of self trust; a fear of letting herself act as she desires; a fear of what she and the others will become.

She's more attentionally concerned with morality than the others: Rachel's growth is in being effective, Marco reduces morality to rationality, Jake seems to relate to things more in terms of obligation than morality. (Tobias is with Cassie, here.) She feels like she isn't a good person, but this is mostly a consequence of her empathy and high internal standards. She never reaches clarity or an end to her internal conflict and self-hatred. Keyword: scrupulosity? (Again reminding me of Tobias, who gets over his version of this problem in the dolphin chapter.)

Basically not much happens for her beyond lots of internal conflict and depression, until the attack on the Ventura pool. At that point, she lets herself act as she wishes, in a fitting mix of selflessness and selfishness. She feels less guilt, but she's still judging herself throughout the process of saving the kid. In death, she feels freed, but she doesn't come to the point of loving herself. Her emotional arc is decidedly incomplete.

So, she dies pretty early on, and I'd still like to see more of an examination of the consequences there. It's been noted that Helium is her legacy, and the animorph's positive relations with Telor (and consequently maybe some of the developments with Terra?), but I feel like this hasn't been done in an emotionally resonant way.

Looking at the chapter, I guess Erek is part of her legacy as well, though I always forget this. Elfangor recently commented that the full consequences of her loss have not yet been observed, so I'm expecting something to come up.

When Cassie was consulted about a mission (whether to defect in the 3-way meeting) Jake didn't follow her advice AND it didn't go catastrophically wrong, so it isn't much of a resolution/payoff. Looping her in this way was a strong idea, since you can confront a frozen-Cassie with the realities of what the team becomes (something about which she was uniquely concerned), but this instance is ultimately a bit unsatisfying since it doesn't amount to anything (IIRC).

Other threads:

- I'm not sure there was ever much of a payoff to her special morphing abilities. I wonder if she'd be able to figure out how to morph a yeerk pool. It doesn't seem like it would be relevant to the plot at this point though, even if she could.
- Jake's brother and Marco's father are her legacy as well, though less plot relevantly. Yet, I don't know if they've ever expressed any sort of gratitude towards her.\\

  - One interesting thing to do is to follow Cassie's emotional journey through the characters that she saves, but Ax doesn't seem similar enough and I don't even remember the names of these family members.

- If Cassie never gets to complete her arc, it would be interesting to see a scene where Cassie reflects on what sort of person she ultimately would have wanted to become, and inhabits/makes-contact-with the aspects of that mentality that are accessible to the stored version.
- Marco was pretty harsh on her when he thought of her on the Arn world. It would be nice to see someone say that it wasn't 100% totally dumb, unless that's the position the story is taking.

I'd like to see more from her: either her stored copy doing something plot relevant or just an emotional scene where she gets to see the benefits of her sacrifice.

*Rachel*

Despite her centrality in the story, Rachel isn't a character I strongly resonate with or get excited about (though on reflection she's awesome), but:

From the beginning, Rachel is ready and willing to fight for humanity. Her strengths are her capacity for action, her intent to win, and her motivating desire to improve and do the hard things. She demonstrates a courage to trust herself to do her best, while also deeply acknowledging her own fallibility. The sense from Jake in the first chapter is that her failings are rage and imprudence, and indeed she makes a big early mistake on these grounds.

After getting her friend killed, Rachel begins her journey. She wants to channel her passion for victory through productive action, and be actually useful. She's impressed with Marco early on, and grows through better understanding his strengths and incorporating them into her own thinking.

Notably, despite her horror at what happened to the Chapmans, she doesn't sink into depression. During the pool escape, she recognizes her flaws, but doesn't let that stop her from trying to do her best and choose the right thing. Here, she reveals herself as sort of “meta-paradigmatic.” She doesn't need an ultimate grounding or totalizing ideology for action, just a sense of the direction she's headed and a trust that she will continue to make adjustments. It takes courage to step into the void, not knowing what the outcome will be or how she will change in response. Having this courage, Rachel can do more than rehearse patterns and self-conceptions. Where many need to understand and make legible a shift of being prior to enacting it, Rachel is able to adopt new strategies simultaneously with constructing the narratives and frames that make sense of them. Rachel being unshackled in this way ties in neatly to her not being planned by the Ellimist: obviously she is a deterministic system, but she is unpredictable in a folk sense. She is a live-player in that her growth and behavior are tightly dependent on feedback from the environment, self-transforming where other pieces on the board are self-inscribing.

Anyway, her action at the pool is indeed good, rewarding her courage. She is able to empower the captured humans, her actions facilitating a shift in roles on their part that would not otherwise have been possible. Something similar occurs with Ante: her presence allows him to break the bounds of his existence, and start really participating in life rather than LARPing.

Her next significant moment is her realization about putting down the sword, the war not being about revenge. In coming to this realization, Rachel has already completed her arc with respect to her initial flaws. That's okay though: despite making a big mistake early on, her story isn't defined by her flaws or the things she continues to miss in the way it is for the other characters. Rachel constantly seeks to learn and improve, and her story is more driven by this proactive desire for growth than anything else. Now that she has grown beyond her core failings, we get to see what sort of adult she will become.

I'm not really sure what to make of the brain-damage plotline. We'll see where it goes.

*Others*

I didn't really find myself taking any notes for Garrett, Ax, or V3, though clearly they all have arcs. My bad.

One a separate note, here are some *additional things* I'd personally like to see before the end:

- It seems like a waste to me to write the best Animorphs story and not explore all of the interesting consciousnesses. So, what is it like to be a yeerk pool? You've played around with this and suggested their scale and power. The asynchronous nature of sending out actions and receiving feedback, examining memories for every detail. If you do something from Terra's perspective, you can present the experience of a yeerk pool, and also how pool-experience has changed now that the yeerk's “fingers” aren't fully under its control.\\

- This would also be a way to examine whether humans and yeerks can ever love each other or cooperate, given their divergent evolution-given moral understandings. It's still difficult for me to understand Temrash's indulgent cruelty (if I may) towards Tobias. I can see how things that feel like violations to us wouldn't to them, but Temrash has seen this stuff from the inside, and still acted that way. Terra's perspective would show us what this new way looks like from the inside, and whether there has really been a transfer of values (as first shown in the Aftran interludes). (I'm also interested in the human experience of being more concretely part of a superorganism, but this could also be demonstrated, to a lesser extent, by seeing things from the V1!Marcos' perspective.)

- On a similar note, we haven't seen (beyond the recent Alloran flashbacks) what classical Andalite experience is like. Maybe there isn't much of interest to say about their hive-mind nature, and it's just a hindrance, but if you have things to say about it I would want to hear. That guy with Seerow and Alloran in his head should be pretty cool, and then we'd get to hear from Seerow and an unbroken Alloran. If you could show a splinter cell that is able to break away from the crowd and do something useful, that would give me some hope that Andalites don't just suck, and give them a chance to contribute to the happy non-tragic ending.

- (Least of these three) I'd like to see more of the Arn, possibly just because I thought their grammar was extremely endearing in the V3 conversation (though that may have been his language difficulties). If Marco explores the Arn morph, that may be sufficient unless you have some cool ideas.

- It seems like Marco and Garrett disagree about identity and death. Marco does note that he feels like he's ~“plugging into the universe in 7 places” and only losing half of what is normally lost in death, but I think I still got the sense there was a disagreement there. At the very least we left Tobias in a state of unclarity, and I'd like to see a resolution to that. Identity is a core motif in the work, so it's worth examining as deeply and fully as possible.

- Marco and Jake as best friends feels like a very faint thread in the story, with the strongest points being Jake's first death and Marco's recent deaths. Now that they are on better terms, I'd like to see some tight coordination, trust, and good-feeling.\\

- The relationship between Tobias and Garrett has been better served, but I want to see the consequences of Tobias' recent mindset shifts. Plus some more love or trust, since they are so precious together.

- Maybe a bit of Marco/Rachael payoff? I guess I'm somewhat indifferent there, myself.

- A few chapters ago I was hoping to see a bit more consequential agency from humanity (the morphing recruits, the government) but I think I'm mostly satisfied after Tobias was saved and YEM blew up Telor.

- There's a lot of discussion in the story about coordination, cooperation, unilateralism, and trust. It almost feels like you could achieve a near-total exploration of these topics (relative to your, or at least my, understanding), given the setup and what you've said so far. I wish I had paid more attention to all of the claims made and questions raised, on these points, so I could point to gaps. If I read the story again, this would be my focus.

- Anyway, one way for this to me a rationalist masterpiece (relative to me-as-reader), would be to flesh out those gaps and start to present conclusions or meta-conclusions. Even better would be to present these conclusions not merely in dialogue or narration but as clear resolutions to character arcs (emotional resonance or plot relevance very important here) or as (somewhat explicit?) underlying dynamics in critical plot events. Ideally the reader walks away with a new understanding of coordination, with resonance built through empathy and simulated experience, strong enough to motivate action and robust to the sorts of challenges offered by our imperfect world and its residents. A high bar, but not out of reach (although I don't know how much of the remaining chapters are already written).

  - One dynamic you might comment on is that we now have V1!Marco and V3 coordinating through tightly-shared-identity, the Animorphs and humans generally coordinating more loosely, and Terra/YEM & Andalite society somewhere in the middle. Perhaps a bit more on the benefits and costs of each approach?
  - (Spitballing now,) Have you written about false perceptions of defection? Seems like you would but I don't recall this specifically coming up.
  - Tragedy of the commons may be slightly outside of scope, but also I think you have somewhat/indirectly discussed this.
  - The above are pretty broadly understood at this point, and not very interesting, but I bet you have some unspoken deep beliefs about this stuff that you could integrate into the story.
  - Marco, Tobias, and Jake all have incomplete character arcs that directly relate to coordination, cooperation, and trust (to varying degrees), so it should be possible to elegantly resolve those arcs at the same time as completing the exploration of these themes.


** I sent this to [[/u/TK17studios][u/TK17studios]] and he thought that some here on the subreddit might be interested in reading. I figured that it might stir up some interesting discussion, but didn't want to put in the extra work of making this a more fun or enticing reading experience. Here we are :P

Nevertheless, I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts :)

** Great thread... I love this story. I especially agree with this part, as its one of the things that didn't quite sit right with me:

#+begin_quote
  . It's still difficult for me to understand Temrash's indulgent cruelty (if I may) towards Tobias. I can see how things that feel like violations to us wouldn't to them, but Temrash has seen this stuff from the inside, and still acted that way.
#+end_quote

I did not understand this when it happened at all. We know that Yeerks are at least somewhat affected by their hosts, so maybe his cruelty was some kind of manifestation of Tobais's feelings towards himself? The same reason he would go on what was practically a suicide mission in the first place? I don't know. And it just isn't brought up again.

Tobias accepting a Yeerk afterward made no sense to me either. Sure, the Yeerks claimed that they were representing a new way of cooperation, but Temrash/Ax claimed the same thing. If I had just been brutalized like that by a Yeerk who I risked my life to save and then someone offered for me to take another Yeerk the answer would be hell no, and I'm not half as paranoid as Tobias is. I just didn't understand...hopefully in a future chapter we will get some insight into his mental state when he joined the sharing

*Notices ur place to talk at length about r!Animorphs* owo whats this?

Another superfan! Someone who might forgive me if I type too much! Excellent! (Edit: I did. Please forgive me.)

I haven't done one big start-to-finish readthrough in a couple million years; I did that when I found the fic and now I dip in and out at luxurious random, going back to reread a passage just because I liked it, or a vast swathe of chapters just because the pages kept turning. In any case I may be rusty about things, so please do correct me if I'm wrong about anything.

#+begin_quote
  There's a sense that things “had to” play out as they do, as events follow logically as well as challenging characters in core ways or giving expression to some interesting ideal or real-world dynamic.
#+end_quote

Does this mean you liked the end of canon, too? I hear people complain about book 54 all the time - “Butbutbut everyone was so /sad/ at the end! /I/ wanted a /happy/ ending!” - and to me that just... so thoroughly misses the point? I love the broken child soldiers, the Pyrrhic victory over the Yeerks, for... basically the exact reasons you wrote right here.

#+begin_quote
  When morph!Jake recovers from his coma, we see the first clear case in which Jake suppresses his emotional turmoil in order to fulfil his responsibility in managing the group.
#+end_quote

Not /quite/ the first time - he does the same in Chapter 1, when he springs out of panic mode to talk to Elfangor, and I'd argue that's a clear case when you know what to look for.

#+begin_quote
  It is to be expected, if Jake numbs himself in response to pain, that he will be the most numb when thinking of Cassie, after her death. And so, Jake's interactions with his stored copy of Cassie provide another example of the degradation of his access to empathy, and the coincident diminishment in his capacity to take on alternative perspectives. When he talks with her, he is cold and derisive, and can only understand her point of view in terms of what she fails to understand. He can't get out of his own head and actually grasp where she's coming from.
#+end_quote

I used to agree with this interpretation of that scene. (There was just the one scene, right? Beginning of Chapter 31? Say anything for “no.”) My first time or two reading it, I got caught up in the emotions of Cassie's grounded, reasonable, principled perspective, and Jake looked cold and unfeeling and a little morally bankrupt by comparison. (It's possible that I've been conditioned by all the media I've ever consumed to believe that the confident, emotionally resounding, Do-What's-Right-In-Your-Heart speech is definitively correct 100% of the time, and in r!Animorphs, that isn't always the case.) More recently, I've come to see it differently: I think Jake understands /exactly/ where Cassie is coming from, and to him, it's not enough.

Marco's opening narration from Chapter 37 sums up Cassie's failure really well, and there are echoes of it in Jake's conversation with her in 31, too. Cassie's an /amazing/ idealist. She's the kind of person we would do well to have more of in the real world; she has an innate understanding of what's fundamentally good, and she tries - /really tries/ - to use that understanding to make the world better. But she critically fails to carry her idealism through to logical ends. She can't make the tough calls, won't allow herself to boil down complex ethical dilemmas to hard numbers. If Marco was faced with the trolley problem, he'd pull the lever so fast he'd have time to crack six jokes before the person got squashed. If Cassie was faced with the trolley problem... well, she /might/ make the “right” choice, but she'd waste time (an extremely valuable resource, especially in a war) cringing and wringing her hands and /hesitating/, and she'd waste even more time feeling really bad about it after.

In fact, there's one moment in the fic when Cassie /is/ faced with something a lot like the trolley problem. Her powers and intel (and presence in freakin' prophecy!) make her extremely valuable to the war effort, and preserving her own life could calculably save millions or billions of others. But instead, she goes after the kid. Now, this isn't /entirely/ fair to Cassie. She made the “logical” call thousands of times, and it was only because the Ellimist specifically engineered the situation to undercut all her logical calls that she eventually made the illogical one. But she has the capacity to make the wrong choice like that; she's so gravitationally drawn to good that she'll choose “good bad bad” over “bad good good,” and that's what Jake is running up against.

You ever play Pokémon Black and White? #BestGeneration, don't @ me? A theme that runs through those games is the concept of /truth vs ideals/. Jake is an idealist, like Cassie, but he also recognizes hard truths, like Marco. Jake feels like he's splitting in two when he talks to Cassie about potentially betraying Telor and Tyagi and everyone. He wants so badly to live up to a righteous moral code, and he hates himself for seeing so far past immediate, obvious rights. But he's also seen firsthand the dangers of living chained to a stiff sense of morality; he himself /died/ for making that very mistake, and to REALLY drive the point home, he watched the girl he loved burn when /she/ made it (and I'd bet that far-reaching insight is [[https://i.redd.it/wfte93j229n31.jpg][precisely why the Ellimist needed her to die]]). Jake can see where Cassie is coming from, but the truth of the matter is that the time for /only ideals/ is past. There's a war on. Jake is too much Cassie to let his world and his species die, but he's too much Marco to get lost looking for a nonexistent clean path to victory.

So he does see where she's coming from, he understands every bit of her logic, and he's frustrated at how far it falls short. He shares her empathy for the human race, but he's realistic enough to recognize that the best way to help everyone in the long term is to make some moral concessions in the short. Now, I don't want to sound like the hyperlogical sociopath or something. I don't claim for a second that I personally would pull the lever fast because it seems so clear and obvious; I'm not the guy who watches Batman and says, “Just kill the Joker! Duh!” (Even though Batman probably /should/ just kill the Joker.) In fact, I think if it came down to it, I'd probably be more like Cassie here than Jake. But the point is that /Jake is better at war than I am/, he can see a bigger picture than Cassie or I, and that's... that's just more important, overall.

Oh my god this got long. What if you're not even saying the thing I'm responding to? I‘m moving on.

#+begin_quote
  In this arc, we would see Jake grow to be less dissociated from his empathy, with more access to what it feels like on the inside of those he models
#+end_quote

I'd also submit that Jake's “final form” would be more in touch with /his own/ feelings. There are a number of moments sprinkled around where he itemizes all his friends' projected reactions and responses to some big Thing, then reaches for his own and finds he doesn't know what it would be.

#+begin_quote
  (P.S. My reading seems to imply that he has some prior trauma or dissociative cause (since even in the first two chapters he didn't seem especially emotional and already thought of his predictions as black-box-y) but it's probably too late to introduce something like that to the story.)
#+end_quote

Hmm. Interesting take. I ran this one by my brain and it told me it /could/ potentially see this interpretation, but it's also perfectly happy to model Jake as just being... like that. I agree it would feel pretty tacked-on to include now. (Maybe the trauma was when he slammed his hand in that car door as a kid and got a scar? Maybe it was when he met Tobias and found out he had a backstory so eerily identical it was almost as if the author had forgotten he'd used it already? ;) )

#+begin_quote
  In this way, he holds himself back a bit and doesn't fully engage with Jake as an equal, taking a sort of “this is out of my hands; my irrational boss is just going to make whatever crazy choice, I guess” stance, bailing on discourse whenever Jake wants to do something based on intuition.
#+end_quote

Worth noting that Marco has gotten better about this as time has gone on. He's gone from treating Jake's little black box with extreme skepticism to /mostly/ respect and confidence. He still likes to complain about it from time to time of course, but he wouldn't be our Marco if he didn't.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, if there's space we should probably see something about his relationship with his dad, who has been a nonentity in the story.
#+end_quote

Ooh, agreed. I'm sure if I sat here and puzzled and puzzled ‘til my puzzler was sore, I could /probably/ remember the three or four little appearances Peter has made since the Ellimist saw fit to teleport him out of Ventura, but his involvement in the story doesn't even come close to Temrash's and Tom's contributions.

#+begin_quote
  He seems concerned with principles, but I'm not sure to what extent this is just a consequence of having to make things legible in his relationship to Garrett.
#+end_quote

Tobias himself seems unsure on this point. There's a part where he talks about holding himself to the principled standard that Garrett would, and then he reminds himself that that's a standard Garrett simply copied off of the one Tobias invented for Garrett's benefit, and then he questions the validity of this recursive value-copycatting just leaning on itself for support. I love that. It seems so relatable, somehow, and is just a real standout piece of introspection - even in a story where deep philosophical introspection and questioning one's own values happen in, like, every chapter.

#+begin_quote
  and at one point Tobias wonders to what extent his principles are just a happy story he told to Garrett and then had to live up to.
#+end_quote

Yeah, this part!

*** (2/3)

#+begin_quote
  Namely his desire to save Temrash is revealed as a mask on suicidality (tying back to “black desperation”)
#+end_quote

Mmm, suicidality isn't /exactly/ it - it's more like restlessness, or dissatisfaction, or stir-craziness, or just... an urge so overwhelming to /be doing something/ that it trumps even his instinct for self-preservation. Tobias and Ax talk about this in Chapter 35 (and I only bring it up because Ax specifically points out that it isn't suicidality).

#+begin_quote
  There's something beautiful about Tobias and Garrett making each other into better and stronger people, but it's lame and disappointing if they've bootstrapped on the basis of Garrett taking rules seriously and Tobias being too scared of letting him down -- rather than bootstrapping from a core goodness on both of their parts, with the above stuff acting as buttressing.
#+end_quote

I... think I agree with the logic of this, but I'm having trouble thinking about it as deeply “true” or “important” or something. I think it's mostly just because, to me, Tobias and Garrett both already /do/ feel like they're motivated by a core goodness. The platitudes are a nice garnish, but they're not /really/ the foundation of everything these two characters do.

#+begin_quote
  Finally, I'd be interested in looping back to Tobias' and Garrett's discussion of copies and identities. The conversation felt unfinished, and Tobias' thinking may have changed after he died that one time and Garrett brought him back.
#+end_quote

The conversation from two bullet points ago actually does call back to this conversation; Ax is saying something to Tobias that's a lot like what Tobias previously said to Garrett, and Tobias gets thrown off when he realizes that his thinking /has/ changed since Garrett brought him back. If his perspective hasn't /actually/ pivoted, he is at least saying words that are the opposite of what he was really thinking back in Chapter 28.

Also, I've spent some time imagining what it would be like to wake up as a clone. I think the whole “death” thing would be less intimidating after it happens, and you can think back and say, “I've /felt/ alive for my entire life,” - it's not like there's some traumatic break at the point where you died.

Overall, I think a lot of the unfulfillment you feel from Tobias is just stuff that hasn't had time to develop yet and likely would have anyway. We've only had one real chapter with him since his awakening, with his absence serving as a little bit of an intentional tease; I trust the author to round out Tobias a bit more when he finally gets the stuff he's been building to.

#+begin_quote
  Elfangor recently commented that the full consequences of her loss have not yet been observed, so I'm expecting something to come up.
#+end_quote

Honestly? I think Elfangor is just wrong here. He receives a prophecy with four human children's names basically painted in fire across the sky, and then he lives with that knowledge for, what, ten years? Then he wakes up one day to find that, among other things, the kids have been operating in the war against the Yeerks for a couple of months and one of them is already dead, without having struck any major blows or contributed in any decisively meaningful ways.

People in this story draw reasonable but incorrect conclusions all the time. Elfangor is working with the information he has - one of the things he /doesn't/ have is access to that interlude where the Ellimist or Crayak slowly and painstakingly guides Cassie to an extremely deliberate death. Probably the Ellimist, because I don't think he'd go to the trouble of getting her involved if she was just going to accidentally die before she could serve her purpose. Again, it seems possible that dying /was/ her contribution to the war, in the gift of clarity it gave the others.

(Incidentally, the author has been dropping hints for a looong time that Cassie isn't even really all the way “dead” so it looks like Elfangor's assumption is flawed to begin with.)

Cassie is the part of your post I've had the fewest responses to so far, and I think that's because I disagree with your overall assessment of her character, so it's more just one big point to respond to rather than several little ones. My impression of Cassie is going to seem harsh from where you're standing, but I think she's more of a cautionary tale about what not to do in a war. She cracks, she crumbles, and she dies. Through that lens, it is a reasonably complete arc. I don't want to sound unsympathetic to the strain that's placed on her, but the reality is that she has some very serious flaws in her thinking that are ultimately exploited to get her killed. She dies a noble death, a hero's death, and that in and of itself makes our reader hearts try to jump into our throats, our souls want to rally behind her as some sort of martyr. But that /can't/ be the final arbiter of whether a character's choices are portrayed as correct in the end. Cassie's decision was selfish, shortsighted, and, whether it's comfortable to admit or not, it /was/ dumb. She shouldn't get “an emotional scene where she gets to see the benefits of her sacrifice” just because it would /feel good/ for the reader; an easy emotional payoff shouldn't resolve and justify her doing the wrong thing. That flies in the face of everything rational fiction stands for.

#+begin_quote
  Rachel
#+end_quote

I'm really into the mystery of Rachel's glitchy morphing! Aside from that, we're on pretty much the same page as far as she's concerned. She has a couple destructive freakout chapters right at first (flaming tiger paw) and then she spends the story kinda slowly developing and feeling herself out. That's cool in the long term, but isn't quite as action-packed as being in the other characters' heads. (I think the Ante chapter is my least-read section of the entire fic.) As canon!Ax puts it, how do you weigh the sharp rush of battle against the slower, more contemplative joys of watching your trees flower?

I'm also not quite sure how I feel about the degree to which Rachel leans on her Shoulder Marco for introspection. It seems like every character has a Shoulder Marco making little quips in their heads all the time, with maybe Shoulder Cassies a distant, distant second, and like, maaaybe Shoulder Jakes after that, with everyone else tied for last (aside from Garrett and Tobias who have shoulder versions of each other, even if they don't openly converse with them often). It feels a little bit like the story is just sorta fetishizing Marco, but I've always been able to look past it, since it's never been present enough to be distracting. In some of the more recent Rachel chapters, though, I would say it's graduated to the point of being distracting. IIRC, there were times in the Ante chapter where it felt like Rachel's little mental model of Marco was doing more of her thinking than she was. I just feel like it kinda takes away from her character if she's routing so much of herself through another character, especially this late in the game. Maybe that was the story telegraphing her and Marco's budding romantic relationship, but truth be told, that's another facet that I'm a little “eh” on.

The sculptor section is great, though.

#+begin_quote
  Garrett
#+end_quote

You didn't do a section on Garrett, but I just wanna fanboy out for a second. He's such a wonderful, fascinating character to read - possibly my favorite in the whole story, which is kinda funny, considering he's an OC pls dont stel. I'm so excited for his chapter coming out next! If you look at the numbers a certain way, you could argue that he's only had one real chapter in the past /three and a half years/! A crime.

I could go on and on but I know this comment is miles too long already.

Out of curiosity, what else would you like to see from Yeerk pools that we haven't already? There have been a couple of interludes now that I think captured it pretty handily. The pools are vast and ancient, and they think very broadly. Sounds good to me.

I think it would be too time consuming to really get into our difference of opinion here. Perhaps one day in the future.

But if the stance of the fic is that what she did was wrong, or deeply ultra wrong, or whatever, I don't think that precludes some sort of emotional resolution. E.g. such a scene could certainly be mostly a reflection on her failures. I don't at all mean to be saying that she should be rewarded or given justification for doing the wrong thing.

There's an almost psychedelic experience to reading a detailed first person account of a significantly divergent mind. I want to feel like I have a sense of what it's like to be a yeerk, from the inside. I think I'd have to sit in the perspective for at least a few thousand words before being really able to shift into this slower, more expansive mindset.

Yeah, but that feels like the book is saying that Andalite communities (and the species in its natural form) is fully inferior in the important ways to humans. Sure they can think multiple trains of thought at once, but the can't innovate and they can't change their minds. If the only good andalite is the one you force into social isolation and then infest with a yeerk... that's pretty damning. I want to see the upsides to their alternative, more interconnected mode of being!

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, one way for this to me a rationalist masterpiece (relative to me-as-reader), would be to flesh out those gaps and start to present conclusions or meta-conclusions.
#+end_quote

My reaction to this is... complicated. I have this kneejerk instinct that the author's vision needs to remain “pure” and I can't help but see reader suggestions as a diluting agent - even when they are very good suggestions, like this. I know I'm being unrealistic here. Obviously the author himself takes reader suggestions into careful consideration, and obviously he wouldn't incorporate anything that doesn't make the story better or that drastically changes its overall trajectory. He sees suggestions as a fertile source of change for good, not as something that seeps in and taints his “original” layout for the story.

[[/u/TK17Studios]], since I know you're reading this.... There's nothing I can say like “don't let your story get tainted” that isn't already profoundly obvious. I guess let my comment serve as a reminder to remain critical of comments. Don't let reader opinions become any sort of gospel, even when they're extremely intelligent and well-reasoned. You're better at this than Applegate or Yudkowsky or any one of us readers. As long as suggestions are being rolled into the story to make it /more itself/ rather than less, that's a good thing - just don't let the story's identity be swayed from the seed it's grown out of, because it is and always has been very, very good already.

#+begin_quote
  Stuff about Cassie's death
#+end_quote

I don't disagree that Jake understands where Cassie is coming from to some extent.

It's hard to really know what to say about Cassie. I think she carries an important banner that she doesn't know how to explicate in Rationalist terms. So I could steelman her and say what that thing might be, but I'd just attributing things to her with very little basis. Certainly at some points she is just making mistakes.

Regarding the analysis about her value (given that she is one of the Chosen Ones, she is more important to save than others), I think it's true that she doesn't weigh things correctly, or even-handedly, or for nearly long enough. On the other hand, I don't think your analysis is right either. For one thing, any action she takes can be said to be the Ellimist's grand plan for putting her there. I don't think it especially preferences her staying alive longer rather than shorter, or saving herself rather than someone else. Further, she can be resurrected whereas Jake's brother and Marco's dad can't be. Finally, a big reason she makes the call to save both of them is because she thinks doing otherwise would make them hate each other (very possibly losing the war, though that isn't her focus; she also considers saving neither, but it feels pointless because there's nobody who is a much higher priority and she thinks they would then resent her forever). She realizes she can save the kid, which she wants to do, and sure it's a risk but I don't think we can confidently say she's wrong in her assessment that she can save him and get out of range of the explosion.

So, that's not SO crazy. As you and Marco note, she has found her solution where she gets to save both of them, and help the boy in front of her, and that's enough for her.

Her biggest mistakes comes after that though, not in drawing the line to the wrong point, but in failing to reevaluate as conditions change. Specifically, she sticks with her decision after Tobias bargains for another person to be saved (saving Erek basically as an afterthought, not reevaluating the chain of emotion and logic that led her to the decision she landed on), and she still goes to save the boy after returning to Time on the outside of the building instead of inside. Both exemplify the same basic error, but I have a hard time faulting her for it too much.

Saving Erek is worse: she's finally reached a feeling of goodness and confidence in her decisions (something she values extremely highly), and she fuses that with the specific choice she's made, so (as mentioned) sticks with it even when the reasons to do so have been decreased (like, maybe she ought to have decided to teleport the kid away, fly away herself, and let Erek die; she wants to save him less than the kid, clearly, and hasn't even considered this option; indeed, she realizes this immediately after finding herself outside). That she still tried to save the kid after being outside... well, in both of these cases she's given very little time to think, or reassess the quality of her plan. Clearly she's a bit stubborn, but we're looking at like a couple minutes of her life. I don't see these decisions as damning, merely as a demonstration that she lacks the important capacity to think clearly in crises and hold beliefs lightly even in charged states and high-stakes situations. Would Jake or Marco have bailed on the attempt, if they found themselves outside and the person they meant to save was a parent?

You might be right that Jake understands Cassie to some degree, and is correctly seeing her errors. He's played the conversation a bunch of times and has direct access to her thoughts and feelings.

However, I can't agree that he fully understands her in the scene we see. I don't have the will to really justify this, but I don't think we would see the coldness or (in his words!) literal hate if he was able to actually deeply grasp her perspective from the inside.

Imo, if he's hating, then 1) we can be pretty confident this is clouding his perception and judgement, hiding and distorting and selectively amplifying and 2) in itself demonstrates he doesn't get something, because Ender says that if you understand someone you love them, and the FFN/Ao3 handle of [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]] is WhatWouldEnderDo (mic drop).

** Rereading some recent chapters:

- Rachel's (coming?) rebirth maybe mirrors V3's

- Rachel and Marco are super cute, and I appreciate what the chapter did to backfill a sense of scale for their romantic interactions. I'm back to thinking their relationship is interesting. It's fun to imagine all of these interactions happening through stored copies in the intimacy of morph, and the surfacing of those memories when the other is re-acquired.

- War Prince Jake is extremely intense; not really getting a Samwise vibe at all.

- I had somehow missed the yeerk pool interlude. Extremely interesting and I hadn't thought about the pace-of-experience-accumulation angle. This is exactly the sort of thing I'm here for but I'm definitely not satisfied yet :)

** Revisiting this thread, another loose end I would like to see tied down is learning more about the Andalites. They are so interesting that anything would be welcome, but specifically I want to know why the Andalites are so militaristic in the first place. In the original series the Yeerk-Anadalite war had been going on for 30 years (IIRC) by the time it reaches Earth, so it makes sense that Andalite culture would be the way it is after three decades of total war.

In this story, the war has been going on for a far shorter period. And yet, Alloran made his reputation as a military genius /before/ the war, as his seizure was the opening move. Elfangor was Allorans apprentice and considered a prodigy before the Yeerk war. Who did the Andalites fight before the Yeerks, or who were they preparing to fight? Helium mentions that Alloran is a "decorated veteran"...of what war? Alloran was training for military service as a child, and we aren't led to believe that this is unusual at all. We already know at this point that the Andalites aren't the noble heroes we may have initially thought. In an earlier chapter Marco finds a blocked memory of /something/ that Elfangor found out that made him quit the military. Did he find out something dark about the Andalites war record? Which wars did Alloran fight in, and for what reasons were these wars fought? Granted we basically only get to hear from Ax/Helium who is either a brainwashed teenager or not even an Andalite anymore, but still the knowledge that there were previous wars just seems to be there without any details about what those wars were. Is this the kind of knowledge that has been purged by their powerful group-think?
