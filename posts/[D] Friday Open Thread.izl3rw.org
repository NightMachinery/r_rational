Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I would like to learn how to draw. I want to learn how to draw very realistic fantasy settings like [[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OOzLb][Tomislav Jagnic does]], I dont quite know what to call this art style. As someone with the artistic talents of a five year old does anyone know where I can start to learn? I've discovered I need structure for my learning, as I attempted to teach myself piano but could not do it successfully til I signed up for an online piano course.

I've been feeling pretty burnt out on my hobbies due to quarantine restricting my more social ones like dancing, working out, and rock climbing. I feel all stretched and thin . It seems to me that my hobbies that I can do are less relaxing than they used to be due to all of this stress from all this social distancing. Is anyone else feeling this way?

On a more positive note, I finally started reading Mother of Learning and am enjoying it very much. Additionally I started a masters program and am maintaining an A average in all of my classes.

*** The most important part of developing art skills is simply practice. Spend some time drawing every day, even if it sucks. If there's some aspect of your art that you're able to single out as needing improvement, feel free to look up techniques and tutorials, but don't forget to spend time actually putting pen to paper (or stylus to tablet).

A hugely overlooked aspect to skill development is how much contribution the unconscious parts of your brain contribute. By focusing on it regularly, you'll start to see improvement as your brain progresses as you sleep and as you develop the dexterity and muscle memory to match.

*** Getting to the level of the pic you linked will take years if not decades of dedicated practice. My main recommendation is just to start drawing stuff--trees, your hand, pictures of people, objects around te house--but since you say you need some structure, check out [[https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-drawing-course-beginner-to-advanced/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=GraphicDesign_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.US_ti.6020&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_83365030281_._ad_436603254907_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930040689_._li_1023402_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8MjdgtKE7AIVjLbICh1fWA3xEAAYAiAAEgInfPD_BwE][Udemy's drawing course]] or one of what I'm sure are dozens of other online classes.

I'm aso fairly sure that the Jagnic image you linked is a digital painting, so maybe invest in a drawing tablet or e-pen as well.

I can't say I identify with your hobby burnout, but I'm probably happier in isolation than the vast majority of people. As a single guy, having this much free time is pretty fantastic for me--I've been reading, running/working out, playing D&D, and watching movies more than at any other time in my life. I also picked up guitar as a quarantine hobby. I'm not very good, but I find making music to be extremely rewarding even if it still sounds pretty amateurish. It's also a combined mental/physical exercise in a way that I'm not at all used to, which is a nice challenge. I feel that drawing falls in the same umbrella of "activities that engage your hands and your brain," so it might have a similarly therapeutic effect for you.

Congrats on the masters program! I was set to start mine this month, but deferred a semester. Will be starting in January. I'm not looking forward to what will certainly be at least mostly online courses, but I'll get through it & hopefully have a more traditional grad school experience for part of the program.

*** Many people like [[https://drawabox.com/][Drawabox]], it's quite solid for studying fundamentals of traditional (i.e., not digital) drawing. Also, it is very structured.

In general, the study process is 5% learning theory, 95% practicing, so it doesn't /really/ matter how rigorous is your approach. Sure, you need to know perspective, volume, color theory, and many other things to draw on the level you'd /find tolerable/, but they mostly come from drawing a lot, not from following some sort of a course.

On a positive note, drawing is like riding a bike: once you have a solid grasp on some aspects of it, you'll be able to maintain your level even if you take a year-long break.

*** There's a lot of good theory, but art is mostly practice. Art schools know this, so the good ones are all focused on making people crank out gigantic portfolios, because the process of doing that involves getting the practice. The best artists I know all got involved in some additional source of practice on top of that. Some examples are attending figure drawing sessions, inktober, the 24 hour comic challenge, and posting on oekaki boards.

Focus on getting fast first, then focus on getting good. Figure drawing from a photo reference is a great start. I think oekaki is the best format for raw volume, but they tend to be focused on anime, and realism really is a better style for practice (even if you were trying to draw anime in the end). If you can find something like an oekaki board that focuses on figure drawing, that'd be perfect.

And enough theory to copy your fave:

Lighting - Direct lighting is when light goes from a light source, bounces off the object, then heads towards your eyes. How bright it is depends on the angle formed between you, the object, and the light, versus the angle of the surface at the point the light bounced off (you can learn the math from a computer rendering textbook, or draw fruit until you get it). For everything not in direct lighting, you can mostly ignore the angle and figure out how many bounces it'd take light to get there from somewhere directly lit. A lot of artists approximate that by pretending indirect light can wrap around corners.

Color theory - I recommend looking up the LCH color space, it's better than the standard color wheel. You can emphasize things the most with contrasting brightness (which can be tricky because it needs lighting to justify it). You can emphasize second most by making the hues very different. You can also emphasize by increasing the chroma (saturation) of a color. All of these can be done by doing the opposite to everything else, and this is especially effective for chroma (desaturate everything you don't want to emphasize).

Composition - Is a big topic, but your fave is mostly using the rule of thirds plus a defined foreground/background/middleground.

*** Keep up the hard work on the masters, that's awesome!

While my largest source of stress from the quarantine is definitely a reduction in social interaction I've also caught 3 other major factors for me.

It made a lot of my healthy habits much less automatic and hurt my motivation for them. I'm a runner so losing my long run group and having no races to train for has been awful. I don't actually care about my race results, I just enjoy getting better at them as a way of getting healthier. It made my fitness go from sticking to a training plan in order to survive the upcoming race and getting myself to the long run group to doing /pointless/ training and making myself do the long run with my own logistics and willpower. You wouldn't be surprised how well that's working.

It has also made my schedule very easy to disrupt. Without events and friends to meet up with work is my only hard scheduled thing. This let's me slack off on planning, procrastinate, and avoid things I want done but don't want to do.

Lastly I've replaced a lot of my hobbies with much worse things, the worst of which is politics for me. It's opening a fire hydrant of objectively stressful and useless information. I've finally realized it but I'm torn between my drive to adhere to the categorical imperative and keep engaged vs utilitarianism to shut it off due to negligible positives at personal cost. I've also generally replaced social time with computer time, which isn't good even before that got consumed by garbage.

On a positive note the first step to improving things is identifying them, so hopefully my problems help people here too!

About emulated humans who're being looped without their knowedge/consent, so that they can handle support tickets at a software company or something like that. The short loops keep people from realizing that they never go home at the end of the day. Some of them are looped for longer, because they have long-term tasks, but are cooped up in a research bunker. I thought it was qntm's, but I can't find it on the qntm site.

And I get not wanting to just tell the same arcs over again, but since Brotherhood does go back to the start those arcs are supposed to stand on their own. And in comparison, they just don't.

If I recall correctly the manga ending simply wasn't finished when the first anime completed, so they went off and improvised. I would agree Brotherhood has a more complete ending. I shall have to see which one I prefer when I get to the original's ending again.

*** I feel like a lot of it doesn't need studies done because it's just immediately beneficial. Like, if you always follow the mathematical approach to the secretary problem whenever an analogous problem pops up, you'll pick the optimal choice more often than someone who goes with their gut. Or even simpler, if you commit to living your life according to what prevailing data says is healthy, then you'll eat wholesome foods & exercise & not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.

When it comes to pseudo-rational stuff that the community has deemed related, like polyamory or earning to give or whatever, things get murkier. But first-order rationalism seems axiomatically helpful to me.

In addition logic can be used to derive things you don't need a study to work from axioms.

** Dating seriously again has astonished me.

Like, I seem to very quickly find people I consider "perfect" and am able to be in stable relationships. Perfect in terms of similar values, sex stuff, finding each other attractive, etc. And I mean /very/ quickly - within 6 days of a major breakup I'd been on a first date with someone who, although it's early days, is definitely a "long termer".

I have been on two other first dates, both of whom have turned out to be more suitable to casual dating, which is fine as I don't want too many serious things going on at once.

I'm completely astonished that Mr Long Termer is, well, so great, because there's probably nothing particularly special about us our our relationship, we're just two random people who happened to go on a date at the right time. I'm sure in the past 7 years I stepped back from dating I could have had dates with 10 people who were just as great as him, and I'm sure that there's probably 5 equally good men I could have dated in the past three months and been just as happy with.

FWIW, due to the unequal dynamic of cishet dating, people might be saying "well it's easy for you as the sort of woman who hangs out on [[/r/rational]], you no doubt have the pick of all the greatest nerds!" and to that I say, Mr Long Termer says that 2 of the 7 people he's gone on dates with in the past ~9 months have been long termers, and he's an overweight nerdy 30 year old man with 2 kids. He's not some chad.

Isn't this... amazing?? Like, people put so much pressure on themselves to find "the one", but, polyamory aside, there's... so many Ones out there!

And yes, two months into a relationship I'm waxing lyrical about "the one" - yes I know what new relationship energy is and yes I know I'm still steeped in it and yes I know I might look at this post in a year and cringe. But I'm old, I've been around the block a bit, so I do know this is a good thing we've got going.

EDIT: update, since writing this post I matched with someone on Feeld and am now, against all my better judgements, considering trying to make room in my schedule for him because we spent 90 minutes texting when I should have been asleep. DATING IS AWESOME.

I don't know how small your area is, but if you find you have problems with dating apps then yeah, you gotta do things IRL, you're kind of forced.

That said I've used dating apps in:

- Paris, which was a whole different experience because there's effectively an infinite supply of people

- My home city, which has about 2 million people in its greater metro area. No problems whatsoever

- A big country town, with about 400,000 people in its greater metro area. This was in 2012 so before the heydey of tinder and the like, but I remember having much lower standards on OKCupid. My boyfriend there I met through roller derby, though I did go on a date with a guy from OKC who remains a good friend to this day (we didn't click in a romantic way).

My strategy as a straight woman is very different to what I'd advise straight men to use (eg: the guy who I'm seeing tonight, I picked him up by standard flirting when we met and then when I ran into him at a party a few months later, I just straight up asked him to go home with me), so I don't have advice beyond the tired "go out and meet people!" and "have basic personal hygiene".

My sister and I had a conversation that I took to heart while I was dating my last-but-one girlfriend, who I had planned on bringing home to meet the family. She asked me if I didn't think it was unfair to my mother and grandparents to keep introducing them to women who I knew I probably wasn't going to be with forever, and if I didn't think it might cheapen what should be a pretty significant step. She was right--I didn't plan on being with last-but-one forever, and my grandparents want great-grandbabies so badly that it's cruel to dangle false hope in front of them. But my takeaway wasn't "stop dating so many women seriously," it was "don't bring women home to the family so soon." I really like emotional connection, physical & intellectual companionship, and getting to know a person that deeply, and (COVID dating issues aside) I don't plan on not doing that in the future. But I think little sis was right that, if I plan on operating like this, I need to push that particular milestone back a few notches on the relationship meter.

I think the moral of the story here, not to toot my own horn, is that smart, honest, open people tend to find others in the same vein. [[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/opinion/how-to-cultivate-the-art-of-serendipity.html][This article about serendipity]] has resonated with me since I first read it (and how cool is it that that word comes from a fairy tale?)

Congrats on your new beau, and enjoy your periphescence.

now that's a new term for NRE.

And yeah, it's good to have well-meaning people in our lives!

I had a friend go "...are you seeing all these new men and having all this sex because you're depressed?" and honestly I'm kind of doing it because I'm much /happier/. Life rules.

(oh and don't worry I live in a covid-free jurisdiction so me going on dates and hitting on people is fine!)

*** I wonder how much or if it at all this has to do with that in terms of cishet interaction it's much more of a two way street than it has been for a long time.

If we're talking about the period of time from when women were able to choose their partners (so quite recently) to now I'd imagine the dating pool has only really improved as traditional perspectives disappear more and more. In general I'd expect the more open and communicative approach of modern society to work better

In addition perhaps the way we search has improved, modern matching algorithms seem to be able to recommend youtube videos, I'm sure they could cut some chaff out of dating pools

**** When you say "all of this", what "this" are you talking about? Finding eligible partners?

I think technology has definitely helped with the search/etc but also, yeah, I wouldn't want to be transported into the 1960s and not be able to do the stuff I like doing in dating (like, y'know, polyamory or being EXTREMELY forward with men - my "line", if you can call it that, to get someone into the bedroom is literally "do you want to go to the bedroom and see what happens?", which according to a friend of mine is not so much a line but a blatant invitation to have sex).

I don't know if searching has improved. OKCupid is great because you match according to questions, but tinder is the most popular in my area and you have only a photo and a short profile to judge by, and there are just so much fewer people on OKC now. I've moved to feeld because it's easier to find non-mono people there, but it's also, like, full of people looking for one time things / FWBs / unicorns and I'm like, can't we have a long term committed relationship but only see each other once or twice a month, lol?

***** "if it at all" then should be a comma I suppose before "this" but there's no of unless I'm looking at the wrong bit.

See what happens is less forward than some people these days, which is for the best as a clarity of expectations helps assist with consent. Still way better than most and such a step forward from "it's cold outside"

I don't know about tinder but other apps have filters and at least bumble let's you see at a glance a number of things you might care about. I wasn't saying we're at that point merely that we should be, I don't really think humans are that much harder than youtube recommendations or Spotify suggestions, the issue is just data collection

I'm afraid I can't help for better suggestions, I'm surprised you can't find anyone else looking for something similar. An open long term intermittent relationship seems ideal for a lot of workaholics

****** The thing is I have so many partners now (husband, boyfriend, 2 pieces on the side, 2 permanent LDRs) that I'm being extremely fussy with what I'm looking for. Like, when I just had my husband and LDRs, the modal chubby geeky guy would for sure get a look in because that's 100% my preferred type, but now I'm like, you also need one or more of (queer / vegan / probably other things idk).

That said, because I know I'm subconsciously racist (only ever dated white guys despite living in a multicultural city), I do have a policy of swiping right on any men of colour I see. Not sending a message first or going on dates or anything, just swiping right, to give them a little bit of a leg up. I would encourage other straight women to do the same, since the opportunity cost of doing so is potentially getting another "hey" "hows ur week" message that all the guys you're swiping right to /anyway/ are sending. According to a sri lankan friend of mine, dating on swiping apps as a man of colour is really, really depressing. (I knew a woman from Saudi Arabia who had it worse, she had basically worked out how to "flee" to Australia for school by pretending to her parents that she was a good muslim (she was an atheist), and most of the Australian men who messaged her were looking for a "submissive" "traditional" type of woman).

Tinder doesn't let you filter by anything except gender, and the info it shows is age, occupation, and the free text field. It's fine but more if you want mindless swiping than if you're looking for something specific. Feeld is more or less the same but it's got more genders you can search by, and you can search for couples (that said in my city, restricting my search to MM couples who are interested in women comes up with nothing, so that sucks (my dream would be to date such a couple!); I tried grindr which is actually technically okay with straight cis women being on there, and although I was bombarded with messages, they were... uh, too thirsty for me).

Anyway in short my life is great. I find dating interesting and fun, but I also worry I'm spreading myself a touch too thin at the moment. But hey, if I can't slut around a bit in my early 30s then what's the point?

******** I definitely think it's different, for me at least, as I find myself attracted to men of colour in the media but less likely to swipe them on apps. I am also attracted 98% to personality and 2% to appearance, so by swiping right on men of colour I can ensure that those with suitable personalities have a chance to dazzle me with their pickup lines.

********* I don't think it's wrong to try to be more open when searching, certainly if you are so heavily focussed on personality then swiping based on appearance is not a good place to start, but I guess you can be racist by excluding people like you're suggesting and it's good to recognise our biases and the such.

I mean no matter what you are people will stereotype you but there are better and worse ones. Westerners expect Easterners to be more submissive, less open, more gender roles. Easterners expect the reverse for Westerners.

There's also the power dynamics where Easterners expect all white partners to be rich and again vice versa.

How do blind people date? What dating apps do they use? Perhaps it's something that would suit you if you're less visual
