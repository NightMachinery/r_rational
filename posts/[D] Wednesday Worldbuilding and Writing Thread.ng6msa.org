Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** A lot of people like to break/build D&D universes looking at the high level stuff (i.e. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u4de0/the_tippyverse_a_dd_35_campaign_setting_where_the/][Tippyverse]])... but I think this is pretty easy to counter by arguing that the high level stuff is vanishingly rare and gets exponetially rarer the higher level you look.

But what about on the low-end? D&D 5e has the [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:magic-initiate][Magic Initiate feat]] with one feat, a person can learn two cantrips and 1 1st level spell from a class. Let's say that most people in this hypothetical universe don't have the equivalent of a PC level, but they can manage with 1-3 years of training learn the equivalent of a feat such as a level of magic prowess equivalent to a Magic Initiate and thus learn 1-2 cantrips and maybe a 1st level spell (or alternatively learn minor [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:telekinetic][TK]] or minor [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:telepathic][telepathy]] or a[[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:ritual-caster][few spells as rituals]]). What does the economy look like?

Even with Medieval levels of education and labor specialization (i.e. 80%-90% uneducated farmers), 1-2 cantrips and maybe a 1st level spell in the hands of an artisan middle class (maybe about 1/20 people) could change a lot of things. Shape Water can only temporarily turn water to ice, but with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhch%C4%81l][little clever engineering]] this could be used to produce normal ice. Or ray of frost might work. With Druidcraft and Goodberry, someone could feed 10 people a day with just a berry bush. And its not RAW, but presumably you could mix the Goodberries into other foods and make them stretch more. And clean fresh water was a major limiting factor but Purify Food and Drink and Create Water both majorly help with this, create Water can do 10 gallons of water a day which is enough for the caster and 9 others. Mold Earth can make ditch digging much faster.

Normal artisans (or other skilled/educated labor) learn a cantrip or two to aid their work. The local tailor might learn Mending to reduce the need for manual sewing. The Laundry man uses prestidigitation. The Town Crier learns Thaumaturgy to make their announcements more easily heard and sound more impressive (and also works as a part time healer). The courtier or judge becomes Telepathic. And so on.

So what economic roles makes sense for a collective magical middle class that knows a cantrip or two per person? What specialized roles or tricks do you get the don't exist in a medieval economy? Anything that breaks the world entirely and makes it no longer medieval? (i.e. Goodberry spam means Druid communes become the dominant social structure). Anything that gradually breaks the world and triggers an industrial/magic revolution or societal shift? (i.e. create water and mold earth irrigation boosts agriculture productivity and mass usage of mending boosts the usage/value of crafted goods enough to shift labor specialization enough to get the equivalent benefits as the industrial revolution)

*** While it would be useful, I think Goodberry is the real standout as both healing and food, I don't think it would be a world changer. The feat limits you to casting each spell once per day.

It would boost the economy saving lives and saving on materials and time, such as Bonfire creating a large fire for one minute with no fuel, but cantrips and 1st level are too limited as is. If you say they can cast the cantrips unlimited times per day (I think that is how it works in 5e) for the full classes it gets much better.

Too many spells are just combat focused. Fudge the spells so they have better non-combat uses such as use acid ball to acid treat metals or Presdigitation's cleaning also sterilizes would be another great jump forward. With unlimited cantrips this would kick off a revolution, in specific areas.

The real revolution would be having custom made spells that replace specialist knowledge, tools, or materials so they can leap frog development. Improve a microscope/telescope (for 1 minute), condition soil, sterilize equipment, find a particular material, control fire/fire, or control/catalyze a particular chemical reaction for a better or otherwise unmakeable end product.

*** The food spells being readily available completely destroy feudal society. A single caster with goodberry can feed 10 people and a single caster with Create Food and Water can feed 15 people.

With just 5% of the population capable of casting one of those you go from 80% farmers->15%. If you had 10% capable of casting it you turn normal food into a luxury/spellcasting/emergency good and could have like 1% farmers.

Almost by definition getting rid of all the farmers would stop you from being a feudal society, and the fact that >90% of the population is probably going to be in cities would make non-city nobles irrelevant at the very least which might very well turn the setting into a collection of city states.

Since you can (arguably) purify all the waste with a few people capable of using Purify Food and Water that means that sewage would no longer be a problem, which in turn means that there is no limit to the size of the city beyond the fact that they would need outside building materials.

Altogether this change would presumably result in massive megacities with mostly empty wilderness outside (with a possible side effect of renaissance and technological advancement over time).

**** That is an excellent point... One complicating factor on urbanization is that goodberry is exclusively a Druid spell, so anyone who learns to cast it, even if they are only an initiate, would need to develop (and possibly maintain) a connection to nature. I think the conflicting pressures for nature-attuned Goodberry casters and for urbanization would result in something unique and ahistorical... perhaps nature heavy suburbanization? Or urban areas heavy on green spaces and parks and gardens? Or the image of forest elves with settlement smoothly blended with nature?

As for create food and water... I was thinking that as a 3rd level spell it would be too rare, if higher spell levels get exponentially rarer a caster that can use 3rd level spells might be around 1/400 in rarity.

***** Yeah, I'm daft. I thought Create Food and Water was level 1 for some reason. It being level 3 takes it off the table completely and leaves only goodberry.

That said, there isn't anything in D&D that I can see that actually requires Druids to be around nature at all to stay a druid. They might have to be in nature to learn to be a druid in the first place (which would lead to massive druid schools in the wilderness), but nothing in the rulebook really implies that they can't just be shipped off to the city afterwards.

With only druids capable of supplying food its also possible they would create an artificial monopoly around food production which would result in a significant amount of the population staying farmers which would make the changes far less significant.

*** I believe this is a setting assumption with Eberron, knowing a cantrip is very common. I'm not familiar with stories set in the universe so I can't speak to how realistically the consequences are laid out. Although the technological level is higher in the setting than most D&D settings.

*** RAW Floating Disk seems busted. Put a plank with counterweight on it, walk until just under 20ft away from the disk, move. The disk accelerates at whatever speed will prevent you from getting more than 20ft ahead. Given straight roads this should allow very fast transport.

Feather Fall seems like it should allow for massless flight, since it caps /downward/ but not /upward/ velocity. Cast it on small creatures strapped to a wheel, and then spin that wheel as fast as you can. This seems generally useless but was too cool not to mention.

Given that food and water is a solved problem with only a minor fraction of the population taking 1-3 years of training, Unseen Servant and the various healing abilities also seem like staples. With plenty of free time and explosive population growth, I would expect everyone to train up if at all possible.

** *WIZARDS ON MARS.*

Scenario: the Wizards of Harry Potter universe decide they want to colonise Mars. Wizarding Britain leads the effort, but other Wizarding countries support it. Their goal, have 10 000 wizards living permanently and comfortably on Mars by 2031.

This is long after the events of the latest HP book. Basically present day.

Assuming the Wizards do not want to involve Muggles directly, but are not above stealing scientific and technological information from them, */how could they do it?/*

*** - Does magic work on Mars? This is /vitally/ important to know. For the purposes of this post, I shall assume that the answer is 'yes'

- Transport is the first problem. Wizards can go a long way with Apparation, and a longer way with Portkeys; but Mars is a far, far longer way than they've ever gone before, and will be hard to aim at, besides.

It's possible that a sufficiently motivated wizard can get there in an instant - /if/ he has a (specifically enchanted) Target Stone placed there so that he can teleport to "near to the Target Stone". Said stone can be slipped into the next Muggle Mars rover in order to get it there (a few spells and the Muggles will never notice a thing).

Having got there, of course, he's left a second suitably enchanted Target Stone back on Earth; so he can easily /commute/. With time, he will get more used to the travel spells, and can shift back and forth more easily.

The ability to commute back to Earth on a grocery run takes a /lot/ of the danger out of Mars colonisation. In fact - why develop a self-sustaining colony at all? ...I guess it could be draining to go back and forth all the time. Very well, then. They can bring a colony of House Elves along to do the manual labour - the growing of food and so forth. A few sacks of fertilizer, a few breeding pairs of cattle (for steaks and milk)... a few more farming supplies... a couple of Clear Air spells to deal with the lack of oxygen... and a wizarding family can build themselves an estate on Mars, where they can safely do a few experiments with the more, ah, /dangerous/ spells without threatening Earth.

...not the really, /really/ dangerous spells. Just the /mildly/ dangerous spells.
