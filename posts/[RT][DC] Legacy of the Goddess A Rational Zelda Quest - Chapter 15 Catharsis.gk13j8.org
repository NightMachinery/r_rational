--------------

So much for "short chapter." Heh.

Check comments for voting info and VP ledger.


** Thanks for the chapter, QMs! It's a very interesting decision point.

Some thoughts on each of Zelda's potential approaches:

*Ruler Zelda*

/Pros:/

- More direct control over politics in Hyrule.
- More direct control over military resources in Hyrule.
- More direct access to information that comes through Hyrule.
- More time and ability to work on Zelda's research projects, which may help with large-scale issues in the nation.
- /Probably/ lower risk of Zelda being killed, but this is hard to adjudicate due to unknown levels of assassins and other risks vs. the risk factors from adventuring.
- Zelda's appearance within the kingdom has significant potential to improve morale.
- Placing Zelda in a central location may help manage events once we're dealing with larger scale map-wide issues.
- A lot of the cool adventurer stuff that Zelda wants to do (e.g. going for fragments) could be potentially done more effectively by others (e.g. Link or another powerhouse marked).
- Zelda being able to negotiate directly may be superior for things like talking to the zora, gorons, etc. than having someone who is not perceived to be as high status do it.

/Cons:/

- Zelda has been noted to not be particularly deft at politics. This may improve over time.
- We, as players, do not appear to have a strong enough grasp on the politics to necessarily make optimal choices in regards to resource allocation. There is a very real risk that political actions we take may be worse than what the default would be in Zelda's absence.
- Zelda doesn't seem very enthusiastic about this option.

*Adventurer Zelda*

/Pros:/

- She would probably be sincerely happier this way.
- Assuming we link her up with Link (heh), keeping them together may help with both their happiness and their survivability. They've each saved each other once already.
- If we split her and Link up (which would have to be a separate call), we can potentially race for fragments and dungeons much faster than Link could do it on his own.
- Higher potential to get Zelda direct power upgrades.
- If we find Wisdom fragments, she can potentially bond them immediately. I'd like to note that this could be a huge benefit if we get enough to clarify our dreams or help detect other fragments.
- Likely higher rate of VP earning due to heroing, but I don't want to lean on this because we don't know enough about the mechanics.
- Higher chance of unlocking Lightsworn powers for Zelda, if those require visiting specific locations.

/Cons:/

- More direct, obvious risks, like the risks from dungeons themselves.
- Fewer people to protect Zelda directly.
- Hyrule running without us is going to be a problem eventually; someone like Taetus is very likely to take over in our absence. Ever returning to power there may be difficult.
- If we're not in Hyrule, it's more likely that they could make alliances we disagree with, or directly subvert plans that are integral to our overall success with our world-saving agenda.
- Less time and access to resources for magical research.

*Overall Assessment*

We're faced with potentially huge problems regardless of which route we choose. Either route could lead to Zelda just getting killed (assassins at home, dungeons or monsters otherwise, etc.) A political coup by someone who is taking orders from Demise could be catastrophic, and our absence makes that easier. Ganondorf getting fragments (and other resources of value) faster than us could also be catastrophic.

Currently, my leaning is toward a middle-ground solution. I don't think we can fully abandon Hyrule, but we are not necessarily the best equipped to handle ruling it directly. I also see there being some situations outside of Hyrule that Zelda may be best equipped to handle - notably, immediately bonding any wisdom fragments, as well as political dealings with certain factions like the gorons.

My current leaning is to do something like:

- Have Zelda head back to Hyrule proper and share the situation with her council.
- Choose someone that we feel is politically savvier than we are - but can still be trusted - to become the regent.
- Install the regent in a public ceremony to improve morale while we build up a reputation for Hero Queen Zelda, Champion of Hylia. Make it clear that she is not abandoning our kingdom, but out actively working against the mastermind of the blin and uniting the world against this devious power.
- Plan for the regent to mark other council members, allowing us access to their thoughts and motives. We can rotate which ones are active to check for potential betrayals. (We may have to check how long it takes to make marks active and inactive; if we can do it super rapidly, we could potentially have daily checks for every marked to make sure they have not been compromised.)
- Once we've done what we can to get the kingdom stable under the control of the regent and council, we can send Zelda out again, either with Link or with a second team.

(This is not a formal plan; I'd like to discuss it with people before making it one.)

Alternatively, we could take the opposite approach and mark a third marked to go adventuring in Zelda's place.

** +*Voting time!*+ E: Voting has ended.

We are tentatively proceeding with the planned live DM session for the Obsidian Spire. Assuming we can get the requisite work done over the weekend, it will happen sometime next week. If not, we will publish an opening scene, take another vote, and proceed more conventionally. There is an open vote in the [[https://discordapp.com/channels/196309529850281984/588230711987798026/710528153461719111][Discord]] regarding the best day for this.

In the meantime, we are opening two votes on two topics:

(1) How does Zelda resolve her dissonance at the end of the chapter? What do you think her overall outlook and disposition should be? Your choice will inform her characterization going forward.

(2) What preparation has The Party to Totally Lay Waste to all Evil done prior to setting out for the Obsidian Spire? In terms of shopping, supplies, etc? And in general terms, what is Link's approach? What does he plan to do himself, and how does he plan to utilize his team?

*Note*: Supplies are constrained by simulationism and also by what has already been shown onscreen. Any supplies must be light enough and small enough to be carried by four people riding horses across the desert for several days. In absence of specifics we will assume a sane default loadout -- this is to allow for interesting ideas, not to have you play tetris with Link's inventory.

Similar to before, please preface plans with something similar to [Decision: Zelda] or [Decision: Link] for them to count. Approval voting for plans you agree with can be done by replying with a comment stating your approval. Keep in mind these are intended as relatively straightforward decision points. Thousand-word essays aren't required unless you just really dig that sort of thing.

--------------

Your previous Void Power total was 2291.

Fi used 9 VP for telepathic communications and 70 VP for seven intangible avatars.

Fi used 465 VP restoring stamina for Link & co.'s horses over five-and-a-half days. They were able to push the horses about 30% harder than normal without strain, though the horses required more food and water to compensate. This was easily made up by looting the bandit camps they encountered. For some reason one of the bandit camps had several crates of bananas.

Fi used 151 magic restoring Link. She converted 178 VP to magic to restore the total to 400 as per the SOP.

Chapter 15 spanned 5 days, and during that time you earned 136 VP from Zelda and 149 VP from Link.

You have earned 165 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250), maintaining the same bonus from last chapter since this chapter was effectively a timeskip. Total = 825.

*You currently have 2679 Void Power.*

Each then could be characterized as orthogonal to intelligence, strength, charisma, or any strictly good DnD esque stat, but nevertheless useful together.

** *Plan Shesan is not Gandalf: [Decision Zelda]*

Sheshan's only goal is stop Demise and she would, by her own admission, happily sacrifice Hyrule if need be, but that isn't true for Zelda. If she saves the world and Hyrule is destroyed, then the victory wouldn't be bittersweet, just bitter. Just like how she felt after the battle of Castletown, /never again/.

Furthermore, the resources of the kingdom are not entrusted to her for free. She's made promises to her vassals like Niabi, and indeed to every Hylian. They trust her to work to further the kingdom. If she betrays that trust, the kingdom's resources will eventually be refused to her. And besides, Wymar, Lensa, Vestele, and even Taetus wouldn't help her sacrifice Hyrule.

** *Plan Self-Defeating Gambits are Self-Defeating [Decision: Zelda]*

While in the short term, tossing Hyrule on the fire might be able to stop the Enemy from fulfilling their tasks, it does not actually provide any guarantee of such in an immediate sense, and in the medium term -- to say nothing of the long term -- it would lower the amount of resources that Zelda had to draw on toward the goal of stopping the Enemy.

I think you might have unwittingly assigned Link another therapist, Zelda. I'm sure it will be fine though.

Called it.

#+begin_quote
  Link had been in favor of setting up right next to the oasis, but Koja was insistent that she didn't want to risk dealing with more bandits if they could help it.

I'm not sure how this is going to help with your therapy jo--

#+begin_quote
  Link appreciated working with Ryn. With her it was always simple and straightforward. No unnecessary banter.
#+end_quote

Wait, Koja are you doing what I think you're doing?

#+begin_quote
  She peered back over her shoulder. “No? Just saying, we're out here all alone. By ourselves. Not expected back anytime soon. Nobody around for /miles/. No one has to know.” She winked.
#+end_quote

You are! Also Link sticks his foot into his mouth at least half a dozen times. I'll spare him the indignity of me laughing at him. And Ryn, actually Fi's around. But I'm sure that won't be a problem.

#+begin_quote
  “/A Warlord!/ We've slain another Warlord!”
#+end_quote

2 down, 1 to go!

#+begin_quote
  She started with the war report. It didn't have much more high-level information than what Olvas had already provided---mostly dry details on logistics and troop movements as per usual. She was certain Link would be ecstatic to look over it when he returned. Speaking of...

  “Fi? Could you let Link know what Olvas told me? About the Warlord? I'm certain he'll be excited to hear it. And let him know the reports are waiting for him when he returns.”

  /Yes, Mistress. I will do so./
#+end_quote

...Yes, Link is going to be ecstatic about Fi telling him the good news.

#+begin_quote
  /I request in the strongest possible terms that you not involve the Faith in matters of governance and diplomacy. I would like to speak with you personally at the earliest convenience./
#+end_quote

Uh, oh. Aunt Vestele is /mad/! Ministers Against Delegating

#+begin_quote
  One last thing to do for the day, and then she could rest. Zelda was determined to keep it brief. It was just business. Just a mutual update of information. That's all. Five minutes and she'd be back in her tent. Ten at most.
#+end_quote

Not if we players have anything to say about it. And we won't. Because we will definitely not stuff our plans with tons of questions.

#+begin_quote
  If you have any actual suggestions as to how I can do /more/---please! I'm all ears.
#+end_quote

Preach it! Sister! She won't have any, because it's Shesan, but it's the thought that counts.

#+begin_quote
  More than conjecture, but nothing specific. Call it a hunch.
#+end_quote

..That's pretty much the same thing.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not sure.

I think your catch-phrase could use a little, something. Maybe some more confidence? Not sure though.

** Decision Link

*Plan: Link's Adventuring Kit*

Based on the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOJV6B7MSJ5dAVx7HdJ5T4YPTCmQtqMjyTWwfD1asvQ/edit][google doc]] [[/u/Cariyaga][u/Cariyaga]] kindly made.

General approach: Liberally use Scry/Foretelling before entering rooms to look for traps and any magic applicable during dive. Have Fi convert 700 VP to MP during the trip. Tell Zelda that the trip is beginning and to not have Fi use VP/MP unless critical. Also ask her to find a Gerudo in case we need to translate something. +Have Ryn take point.+

Equipment:

- Ink, Paper (several sheafs)
- Reference Material, Gerudo (mostly useless, but pictures may help)
- Rapid-onset poisons, antidotes (intended for use with meat if dangerous beasties are encountered)
- If and only if it's possible to conceal meat from critters with sniffers effectively, extra meat for the former
- Chalk (multicolored if available, one set per person.)
- Magnifying glass
- Hourglass
- Small balance (for weight comparisons)
- Extra water
- Bandages, lengths of cloth
- Lengths of wood, long and short (usable as splints, crutches, half a litter or 10-foot-poles at their longest)
- Small and medium-sized hooks
- Bindings of various forms (ropes in quantity, twine, glues, etc.)
- Needles, both sewing and operating
- Sutures
- Fishing line, fish hooks, weights
- Small and medium-sized wrench (if available)
- Candles, torches, lanterns, hat-mounted lanterns if available
- Air bladder (to be used if swimming is a necessity)
- Oil (for burning, in quantity and apportioned such that it may be used)
- Chain
- Caltrops, in quantity
- Marbles, in quantity
- Small mirror
- Pitons, hammer
- Grappling hook
- Compass
- Spyglass
- Whittling tool
- Climbing harness (one each)
- Crowbar
- Lockpicks (if one of the party knows how to use them)
- Metal file
- Hollow reed
- Metal wedge
- Fi's Void Magic Radar item
- Desert camo change of clothes
- Flint and Steel
- Tarp
- Signaling whistle (if available), for in case the party gets separated.
- Easily usable hunting traps that could be deployed in a dungeon environment (e.g. bear traps), if available and if the party has the relevant skills to use.
- Empty bottles for liquids that may need to be collected.
- Empty bags for loot that needs to be collected.
- If someone has the skill set to use it safely and it's available, possibly a couple vials of acid. Could be useful for eating through locks quietly, destroying traps, etc.

I would also like to recommend adding the following:

** I'm going to list out some additional things I'm hoping for Zelda to do. If you have other ideas then chime in below. If it's written down, then we're more likely to remember to include it with our next plan.

1. Blindscriers (aka optical telegraphs). Based on my +extensive research+ reading of wikipedia it seems like it was mostly used for military and administrative purposes, not economic like Zelda originally intended. I think the project might work better if she talked to Wymar about linking Castletown with the three main border forts (Talos, Hylia's Watch, and Last Bastion). This could replace the scry network freeing up valuable blue mages or be in addition to the scry network to allow more bandwidth.
2. Meet with Vestele personally, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using it for more power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
3. Getting some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly so Fi can listen in and be capable of translating the language. If we can have Zelda and Fi relay translations for the dungeon crew if need be that would be nice too.
4. Some more testing with Imbuing and marking. One thing proposed was imbuing and object and then trying to mark it.
5. Marking an actual person and finding someone suitable and politically acceptable to bond with the Power fragment. Taetus and Naibi have both been proposed.

Edit:

1. Zelda keeps working on physical training. Maybe practice with Izu on using foretelling since she's best at blue magic.

** [Decision: Zelda]

*Plan: To Rule Hyrule*

*Broad concept:* Both abandoning Hyrule and allowing the world to be destroyed are unacceptable. Therefore, to best ensure the survival of her kingdom and the world as a whole, Zelda begins moving on a plan to attempt to address both issues to the best of her ability. To do this, she will designate a regent to rule in her place and mark the regent. This will give Fi information on what the regent is thinking that can be relayed to Zelda, ensuring the regent's loyalty. It also gives Zelda immediate communication with the regent regardless of location.

Once a regent is delegated and she has taken some immediate steps to stablize the kingdom and raise morale, she will head out to seek fragments and other ways to save the world. While adventuring, she expand her efforts on magical research, conveying useful discoveries to her kingdom that could improve the war effort and the daily lives of her citizenry.

*Future Plans:* Everything below this point is intended to be an idea of what we'd be doing for the /next/ plan. QMs may ignore the section below for the time being if desired; I will repost it (likely in modified form) after the dungeon crawl.

*Next Steps:*

- Zelda makes the decision to designate a regent and resume her adventuring. The specific regent will be chosen after she gets back.
- (OPTIONAL): She asks Laylith what Laylith's impressions of the council members are in order to get another data point on who to make the regent.
- Zelda conserves VP until she is informed the dungeon crawl is completed, using it only for emergencies and safety, in order to give Link the ability to spend VP/mana safely during his dungeon crawl.
- Zelda realizes that some of her magical projects may be more applicable now than ever before, especially because she has access to new tools in the form of old magic and Fi. Once Link's dungeon crawl is completed, she begins working on research projects while traveling back to Hyrule, brainstorming ideas with Laylith and testing things with Fi when possible.

*Research Ideas:*

While traveling, Zelda will attempt any of the following projects that she personally feels, based on her magical expertise, have any reasonable likelihood of success. She will employ reasonable safety precautions, such as putting Luck spells up before testing anything potentially dangerous, Foretelling right beforehand if applicable, and having a healer nearby (but outside of any predicted potential blast radius). If applicable, she may have someone else physically do any dangerous components of the testing and stand nearby to do the healing herself.

/Rod/Imbue Research/:

- Attempt to draw on Blue Burst and Blue Imbue at the same time with the intent of creating an ice rod.
- If this does not work, attempt to mix a Blue Burst with a Green Imbue and see what happens.
- Attempt to imbue an item with all three colors of magic at once in a sufficient quantity that it would normally cause the item to glow and reach the state of conceptual improvement. See what happens.
- If none of the previous methods have caused the creation of a new form of item, but also have not caused anything dangerous to occur, attempt a triple color imbue + Blue Burst on the same item if it is physically possible to do so.
- If we manage to get a triple imbued item, but it doesn't seem to do anything different than a normal imbued item, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP to see if that does anything.
- If we manage to get an item to hold both an imbue and a burst, but that doesn't make it into an elemental rod, attempt to power it with up to 50 VP.
- If none of the mixed imbues work, attempt to power a normal imbued item with up to 50 VP and see if that does anything.
- If any of the tests seem like they are noticeably working toward successfully making something like an ice rod, spend up to 500 VP to make a functional ice rod.

/Empower Research/:

- Spend up to 50 VP attempting to research the Empowerment function that was used on Zelda with the intent of learning how to create a scaling version of the effect with variable power output.
- Utilize any data that Fi has available from pre-empowerment Zelda, during empowerment Zelda, post-empowerment Zelda, and other baseline scans of Hyleans in this research process.
- Also utilize information from other forms of temporary magic transfer, e.g. siphon, and similar abilities such as Marking, Imbue Object, and Invigorate.
- *Intended magic goal:* /Scaleable Empowerment/ - This empowers the target, temporarily granting them a tremendous increase in ability by suffusing them with old magic. The level of improvement scales with VP expended, with a minimum expenditure of 100 VP and no upper limit. This lasts a variable duration based on the VP expended in this process.

/Triforce Research/:

- Spend 10 VP on general scans on Zelda and the fragments when they are not obviously in use to develop baseline data for them.
- Spend up to 50 VP running scans on Zelda and her fragments while Zelda is sleeping, attempting to discern any changes in Zelda's mental and spiritual state that may be linked to the wisdom fragments activating and giving her prophetic dreams.
- Spend another 10 VP scanning Zelda when she casts Fortelling to see if there are any similarities.

*Plans for After Returning Home*:

- Get updated on the current situation. Assess regent candidates. Choose a regent.
- Explain marks to the council.
- Mark the regent and explain that the regent will be marking other council members over time (or Zelda will directly if she is present at the right time).
- Explain VP conservation rules to the regent and make sure they are not using VP frivolously.
- Plan to also mark members of other species, e.g. goron, zora, etc. to help secure an alliance and gain intelligence and long-distance messaging capabilities.
- Make a public speech to raise morale before leaving her kingdom again, both to raise support for the regent and to clarify that she is not abandoning the kingdom - she is gathering allies (like the gerudo and zora) and taking the war to the enemy.
- If possible, spin up propaganda to emphasize the heroic role that Zelda and Link are taking, likening them to heroic figures of the past that proved to be the salvation of Hyrule.
- Based on the results of the dungeon crawl and any information gained during this time frame, plot a plan for Zelda to either meet with Link to continue adventuring in his company or set off without him.

*Taken from [[/u/Mathematicae]]:*

- Meet with Vestele personally, because of the sensitive nature, to have the seekers review what sort of sacrifices and boons the Fae usually demanded/gave. Ganondorf is probably using it for more power, so we want info on how he could use it to benefit himself. Additionally, Fi might be able to replicate what the Fae did with VP.
- Get some language training in Gerudo speech, mostly so Fi can listen in and be capable of translating the language. If we can have Zelda and Fi relay translations for the dungeon crew if need be that would be nice too.

*Fi Memory Projects:*

Defer this to a future update or ignore entirely if the QMs do not feel it is appropriate to include in this update.

- Ask Fi if Marking someone who speaks another language would give Fi an easier time comprehending that language.
- If Fi consents and believes there is any possibility of success, attempt to use Healing magic to restore Fi's lost memories. If this does not work or seem viable to Fi/Zelda, discuss if it may be possible to restore Fi's lost memories through other means, such as direct applications of VP.
