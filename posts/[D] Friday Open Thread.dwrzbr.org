Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** What would people's ideal linker bot be?

My preferences:

- Posts are compact, preferably a single line\\
  (eg. “/[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]], [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]], [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]]/”)
- Avoids repetition where possible (eg. if multiple replies mention the same text)
- Links to text and maybe also discussion threads or some other Reddit post
- Avoids other annotations
- Open source, under community direction
- Easy to dismiss or block

*** I would like it to only activate when people wish it, to link more than one of the places the stories is hosted if there are more than one. Like so:

--------------

I would like to recommend <Mother of Learning> and <Taint> since they both have magic.

Mother of Learning ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Fictionpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Royal Road]]), Taint ([[https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/][lsdell]])

--------------

I am not sure about discussion threads since they would probably die very quickly after being created for many less popular or discussion inducing works. Maybe putting the default sorting by new would help?

Also maybe people can use those character indicators to add works to the list? Web fiction gets created fairly rapidly so this might help the linker bot keep up.

--------------

ADD (Mother of Learning) LINK ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Fictionpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Royal Road]])

Acknowledged; Added to the list: Mother of Learning ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Fictionpress]], [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Royal Road]])

--------------

Though someone would definitely try and abuse this. Not just in the obvious way (by spamming a bunch of fake stuff or breaking the links to stories they don't like) but something subtle like an author defining several sections of their story as a distinct work (book 1, book 2, ect.) so they have a greater representation in a public list of works (if it is public). So maybe that would be more hassle that it's worth. If you normaly use old reddit blocking someone is a pain so being easy to block is definitely good.

Same. On [[/r/HPfanfiction]] they have to summon the bot by using linkffn() and putting the fic's title or number in the parentheses. I think copying that system directly (maybe with just "link" instead of "linkffn") wouldn't be a bad idea.

** Ages ago, I came up with a chess variant to try to get a better intuitive understanding of some concepts from quantum mechanics and probability theory. That didn't work, but it's still really fun. I finally got around to making a computer implementation of it, and it seems like something that folks here would like. So here you go: [[http://noisyowl.com/chess/][Implied Chess]].

The higher level difficulties are standard chess AI stuff, but the ones the page loads with are randomly generated with wildly varying quality.

*** Very nice! Though it seems to me that check and checkmate could also be made "implied". After all, if capturing works by double attack, why would a king feel threatened by a single attack?

So, implied check: you must always make a move that stops your opponent from double-attacking your king on their next move. Implied checkmate: if all your possible moves allow your opponent to double-attack your king on the next move, you lose. Though these might be really hard to see on the board, so instead you could just allow capturing the king :-)

**** It was multiple layers removed from trying to design a game around configuration spaces. You'd move a piece to all possible places it could move to then when you move it again something something decoherence? It never was a fully fleshed out idea. The relationship between threat and the set of spaces a piece could move turned into this.

As I said, it wasn't successful as a quantum mechanics thing. It's a really good chess thing though.

Yeah, I should get around to implementing castling at some point.

Edit: In pop culture quantum mechanics is always about randomness or how observing something changes it. But the part that was always interesting to me is that QM is a set of rules about the interactions between sets of possible states objects can be in.

** I have no strong opinion on implementing “a” link bot (though I'm happy to write one. Conflict of interest disclaimer: I've privately offered to write a bot that links to the wiki). I strongly oppose implementing lightwaver's bot in any manner. To clarify, I don't mean implementing the bot under someone's “political” control, I mean I don't want lightwaver's bot's codebase used as the framework for our subreddit's bot in any manner. I further propose that a pinned thread be created and used to discuss the features the subreddit wants in a bot, or if we even want a bot, and after that discussion has come to a conclusion we should then open dialogue between people interested in implementing the bot. I've laid out and numbered my reasoning below, with the main bodies of my arguments above and a collection of tl;dr at the bottom.

1. Due to the unilateral and undiscussed implementation of the lightwaver bot we failed to consider using such projects. We should have a pinned discussion on the desired features of the bot, and then once we have a general consensus, have a discussion by domain experts (programmers etc.) on how best to implement it. I feel the choice to roll a completely custom bot system instead of using existing frameworks was premature, in part due to a lack of discussion on the topic beforehand, and that as a result we have therefore failed to thoroughly consider alternatives that may be easier and more valuable in the long run, and we should step back from the recent events and start over and try to do this the right way instead of trying to recover from a seriously flawed start. There is a reason most "real-world" software projects begin with a design phase, and it's because finding issues in the design of the software is much cheaper and easier to fix than trying to build the software with no description and then tack on features. ([[https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-equivalent-to-a-blueprint-when-it-comes-to-programming][relevant quora on software design]])
2. Firstly, for example, [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][linkffn]] was mentioned multiple times in the discussion of "what should we put in a custom bot" as far as I'm aware in the discussion, and though I haven't looked hard at the licensing on it yet, it's already up on Github as a ready-to-use bot with installation and operating instructions. The only modifications I assume would be needed to get it running on this subreddit and meet most requests are to modify the fuzzy search to search the wiki titles instead of fanfic sites, and perhaps modify a few strings to “brand” the bot for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and prevent it from triggering elsewhere. I feel that backing off and having a pinned thread for perhaps a week for a long discussion on the features we need in a bot, and only then discussing whether to write a new bot or to repurpose an existing codebase, would be the best way to accomplish our goal of implementing a bot with our desired features.
3. The bot lightwaver is designing seems to be written by someone with little knowledge of the domain. This isn't intended to be an insult, it's simply an observation. While reading lightwaver's postings about the bot to understand exactly what is being considered for implementation on our subreddit, I came across a recent comment and question in a bot development subreddit that concerns me. To paraphrase, a question on how the bot could avoid posting multiple times in the same thread. This should be “free” (very, very minimal / no extra work required) in almost any “designed to industry standards” framework, which means that the framework lightwaver is developing is not something architected in a way most people would be able to immediately pick up and transfer domain experience to when maintaining or improving it. This was further confirmed when lightwaver stated the solution they decided on was to have a separate text file for each thread UUID and keep track of postings there. Having a folder full of hundreds of text files, one for each thread, is not under any interpretation an “industry acceptable” way to track and maintain the behavior of the bot, and more importantly should never have been considered as a design for a production database. A “pre-coded” third party database system of some sort should be used instead of self-designing some system for storing data in and parsing text files, as the database system has been written and tested by people focused on that chunk alone and the text file solution is a horrific solution that will cause problems (for reasons I won't explain in this post but am happy to dive deeper into if someone wants).
4. (I will preface this by saying I am trying my best to avoid starting an argument about recent events and I will happily remove this section if a moderator feels the chance of this starting another argument will outweigh the value I feel it adds to the discussion on this specific reasoning.)I feel very comfortable assuming many people here have had their model of lightwaver's goals, models, and “acceptable methods” significantly and somewhat permanently altered regardless of the “validity” of the updates and therefore will be understandably upset if lightwaver is seen as retaining anything that could be viewed as a degree of control over any part of the subreddit; therefore, lightwaver should not be involved in any way, shape, or form with this bot. I don't suggest this because “it is guaranteed lightwaver will abuse this” but rather because “some people believe lightwaver might abuse this based on recent behavior, and the drama that would be generated by any association in conjunction with these concerns outweighs any benefit of keeping lightwaver involved in the design, implementation, or maintenance of the system regardless of the true likelihood or possibility of the association being abused”. In my thoughts, that exclusion would include the backend or any components that go into the bot (and I would similarly request lightwaver publicly provide source code under an MIT license or the like and not just build artifacts if their bot is implemented by the moderators to prevent drama over that, for example).
5. Finally, I was looking at lightwaver's described implementation and read something which brought up a huge red flag. I maximally oppose having the bot link to lightwaver's personal subreddit wiki, for various reasons but mainly for #4. I understand that this could likely be easily changed with a few lines in lightwaver's codebase but it's something I wanted to bring up explicitly in case this wasn't already discussed privately by moderators.
6. Finally finally, I understand the new account may draw some suspicion but I hope that saying “I don't want my main account to be connected to this controversy or get involved in arguments with people that follow me out of this thread” will be accepted as the simplest explanation.
7. EDIT: Thinking on it, I came to the conclusion that I should make it clear here that after initially posting this I've privately offered to write a bot that links to the wiki, or to one that meets community requirements as determined by a pinned discussion. I claim that this is not the primary reason I'm not eager to see lightwaver's bot implemented, though you have no reason to trust me, and I won't argue with any claims of conflict of interest. All I'll say is even though it would be in my best interest not to, I feel the ethical decision is obviously to disclose this.

In short

1. The subreddit did not have a chance to go through a proper implementation process for a bot. We should have had a pinned thread for the desired features of a bot, and we also should have put together a team to implement the bot in the best way possible. Recent events caused us to skip that process, but it is an important one and we should not allow recent events to hamstring the deployment of an ideal bot as designed by a proper process. Instead I propose we start over from where we should have started to begin with.
2. Code to do everything people have requested from the bot [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage][already exists]] in production as visible source on github (and they may be amenable to opening it) with much higher quality and years of battle-testing, with simple and minimal changes required to get it running on our subreddit.
3. The choice to custom-design a text parsing system and filesystem-based database instead of the industry-standard of using a prewritten and battle-tested database engine concerns me with regards to the code and design quality of the rest of the bot.
4. lightwaver should be completely removed from this project preemptively to avoid a chance of the community being further damaged by unneeded drama. Again given the events recently, I don't feel this is something I need to explain my reasoning on, but I am happy to do so.
5. All bot components and databases should belong to this community's subreddit
6. Alt is to disassociate any drama from my main account.
7. I've offered to write a bot to replace lightwaver's.

** John Carmack, known for the technologies behind Doom, Quake, and his recent work on Oculus, is winding down his work at Oculus and is pivoting to work on GAI:

#+begin_quote
  Starting this week, I'm moving to a "Consulting CTO” position with Oculus.

  I will still have a voice in the development work, but it will only be consuming a modest slice of my time.

  As for what I am going to be doing with the rest of my time: When I think back over everything I have done across games, aerospace, and VR, I have always felt that I had at least a vague “line of sight” to the solutions, even if they were unconventional or unproven. I have sometimes wondered how I would fare with a problem where the solution really isn't in sight. I decided that I should give it a try before I get too old.

  I'm going to work on artificial general intelligence (AGI).

  I think it is possible, enormously valuable, and that I have a non-negligible chance of making a difference there, so by a Pascal's Mugging sort of logic, I should be working on it.

  For the time being at least, I am going to be going about it “Victorian Gentleman Scientist” style, pursuing my inquiries from home, and drafting my son into the work.

  Runner up for next project was cost effective nuclear fission reactors, which wouldn't have been as suitable for that style of work. blush

  As reported in David Kushner's Masters of Doom, when Carmack was 14, he broke into a school to help a group of children steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole, and opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested, and sent for psychiatric evaluation (the report mentions "no empathy for other human beings" and describes Carmack as "a brain on legs"). Carmack was then sentenced to a year in a juvenile home.[6][7]

  Around 2000, Carmack became interested in rocketry, a hobby of his youth. Reviewing how much money he was spending on customizing Ferraris,[citation needed] Carmack realized he could do significant work in hobby aerospace. He began by giving financial support to a few local amateur engineers. Carmack funded the company out of his own pocket, for "something north of a million dollars a year."[20] The company of hobbyists made steady progress toward their goals of suborbital space flight and eventual orbital vehicles. In October 2008, Armadillo Aerospace competed in a NASA contest known as the Lunar Lander Challenge, winning first place in the Level 1 competition along with $350,000. In September 2009, they completed Level 2 and were awarded $500,000.[21][22][23] The company went into "hibernation mode" in 2013.[20]

** I've been kind of amazed by PC video game art design recently.

Sure, there are some obvious clones of other games, but there are so many that have some unique look. It is quite usual to see something weird and fantastical coming out every week.

Now if only the writing on these games was as good.

Speaking of... are there any video games that have rational-leaning plots or other aspects?

I'm finally getting around to playing the first XCOM, that's been fun so far.

*** Once you're done with X-Com (I assume you mean the first new one, not the really old one), I recommend X-Com 2 with the expansion, really a strong game.

Something I think some in this sub would like is Dwarf Fortress, which is notoriously difficult to get into but is very rewarding. The world is constructed with a new geology, geography, ,mythology, and history when you start, and then you're tasked with building a dwarven settlement. When it inevitably fails, you can start a new one or become an adventurer and visit the ruins of your once-mighty civilization. TheAI for the dwarves is pretty cool, they have complex thoughts and relationships and managing all that is a big part of the game. The building an economy stuff is all pretty interesting, as well, and you can make weird superprojects, some people have even built [[https://www.pcgamer.com/meanwhile-in-dwarf-fortress-players-build-computers-powered-by-vampires/][working computers]] inside the game.

Something that isn't rational but is quite cerebral is Slay the Spire, a card game rogue like. Just a verydeep game with an interesting style.

That is the plan. I need to finish the first one (Enemy Within), but I've already restarted it five times. I get a little ways into it, and then learn that I messed up something (sub-optimal base expansion, for example) and start over. I've actually started Divinity: Original Sin at least 10 times without finishing it yet. I'm not going to say how many hours I have in it already.

I've read about it here and there. Maybe when I retire... it seems like a lot of work. There's also various games where you are building factories and such I might try someday.

I'll check out Slay the Spire.

Edit: spelling.

***** Sounds like you're a perfectionist. Have a few of those tendencies myself. Especially with Divinity 2, I think you're better off just banging through the game, at least the first time. Might help to find someone to play with to help move things along. Happy gaming!

****** I'm a crazy gamer, really.

One the one hand, I want to squeeze out every advantage, to get the maximum result. But then I would win all the fights easily, which is boring, and I don't want that either. But I don't want to play a game either that requires the utmost careful optimization, because I doubt I'd have the patience for that either. And I don't want the game to silently up the difficulty, because I want to "beat it" by creating an excellent build.

Like I said... crazy.

*** Have you seen gwern's anime face generator? If fresh graphics amaze you, perhaps we could supersaturate that desire by using the same technology to write a game engine where generating a new art style on the same polyeders is a matter of adjusting some sliders.

**** Along those lines, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayPqjPekn7g&feature=emb_logo][NVidia research published some really neat stuff in AI-generated graphics last year]]. They performed image segmentation on a real scene of driving to turn it into a blocky, mono-colored image, and trained a neural net (I think some sort of GAN?) to do style transfer back to the real images. Then they set a game engine to just render single colors for what type of object it's showing, and had the neural net turn that into new video.

** I've developed kind of a lot of emotional intelligence in the past ~2.5 years, and I'd like to offer that to the community. Possibly as a start to life-coaching? Not sure yet. Regardless, if you're interested, PM me and we'll exchange numbers, see what happens. Experiments! :D
