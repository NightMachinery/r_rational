[Contains spoilers]

In MoL many things are explored relatively in depth but one thing that I feel I still don't have a firm grasp on are the mind. Clearly the mind is where emotions, memories, (skills?) and personality resides but where is it and what is the structure? Below I've compiled what I know or think likely, hoping to spark a conversation.

#+begin_quote
  Where
#+end_quote

Given that both soul and mind seem to be preserved through the loops, as opposite to the improvemens to the body, I initially thought that they were intrinsicly connected. Maybe minds were a part of the soul. However since Alanic needed to cast a spell for Zorian to preserve his mind when he was doing the intense soul training, the soul and mind are clearly different entities altogether.

The spidies seem to think that there is a non-physical network of minds although we don't know if there's any actual merit to this. Since anyone Open can detect nearby minds *nearby* it seems likely that the mind either physically resides somewhere on the person like a soul does or, in the case of some non-physical 'web of minds', have a detectable point of contact.

Further evidence that are going against the idea of a alternative plane of minds, rather than minds being just adjacent to the body and soul, is that the loop is cut off from other minds. If there was a single plane of minds then this plane would have to be cut off from the original world. Or I guess a chunk of it could have been cut out but that seem awefully complicated.

Does anyone know if minds are actually located in the body similarly to souls or have anything that I missed or misinterpreted?

#+begin_quote
  Structure
#+end_quote

It is unclear how the different parts of the mind are structured. Based on discussions with Aranae it seems like there are two layers, deep and surface.

The deep part seem to contain memories and personality and it seems that this both is pretty fragile since it's so easy to do permanent damage as a novice mind mage. It seem that minds don't regenerate after damage but this might make sense since the mind needs to be ever changing to learn and adapt. Are skills also stored in here? Could personality in theory be altered by mind magic(rather than just memory), even if very complex? What about, say, relationships?

The surface layer seem to contain things such as surface thoughts, sensual impressions and maybe(?) emotions. It seems like it's virtually impossible to do permanently damage by manipulating this layer. And given that it's also virtually impossible to damage someone permanently with a strong mental attack then I imagine that this layer forms a somewhat protective layer about the deep layer and absorbs impacts. Maybe the mind somehow observes this stream of conciousness for processing and it's possible to fool people by changing the stream of conciousness.

It seems to be conventional wisdom that thoughts and emotions fundementally are different. In particular psychics seems to claim that all people, psychic and otherwise, project emotions, maybe in some kind of mental body language. I am failing to find any passages in which Zorian says that this is how he experiences it but I could easily imagine that this would simply be a lie that the psychic community reinforces whenever possible. They certainly have an incentive for it and mind mages, of all mages, are the most capable of keeping something under wraps.

Presumably memory packages are in the deep layer and there explicitly are some storage capacity for these. It seems unlikely though that the mind has designated areas for storage so presumably memory packages are somehow compressed(think zip files) memories that use the same space that regular memories use. If that's the case though, it seems a little weird that Zorian doesn't observe that his older memories disappear when he learns new things and had the Aranea package stored.

Mind blank are said to make people paranoid when used for further time. It is possible, however, that only people who are likely to be paranoid in the first place have consistent mind blanks running, and that mind blank doesn't actually cause paranoia. If it does however this might be because even non-psychics have some capacity to feel the projected emotions and that lack of exposure from these are unhealthy.

Does this seem to match with other peoples' impressions? Feel free to point out anything I missed or interpreted incorrectly.


** In regards to where the mind is, I think that the soul stores a copy of the person's brain state at every point in time, but the soul isn't naturally able to run the mind. As an analogy, a hard drive can hold a multitude of programs such as games, but it can't really do anything with said programs other than copy them somewhere else. This is in line with the stated purpose of souls, in that they allow the deities to look back on a person at any point in time. The brain would be the device that actually runs the mind, and it obviously stores a copy in itself to work with, but it doesn't store a copy of the mind at every point along its existence like the soul does. The time loop thus creates the body of the controller, attaches the soul, and writes the most recent mind state onto the brain for it to then run.

The purpose of the magic brain spell that Alanic cast is to use the soul to run the mind even without a brain. This is somewhat similar to animation spells where the user copies a part of their mind for making the spell "smarter", except in this case the spell copies the entire mind.

*** It makes sense that the brain is needed to run the brain.

What makes you think that the soul stores a copy of the brain state all time time, and as such holds multiple copies of the memory/personality states?

It seems simpler that there is a data-bank stored in the soul and that the brain simply access this data bank and acts as a processor. This also would make Alanic's potion simpler. Giving a magical processor is one thing. Creating a magic processor, creating a magical data bank from the brain, and overwriting the actual brain witht the magical data bank, is many times more complicated.

That does open the question, why do people forget things?

  "They have many functions, most of which we can't even understand, much less influence. But their most important function is not, as many mages believe, that they allow one to produce and shape mana. It is the fact they serve as a living, breathing record of everything a particular entity is."

  Zorian raised his eyebrows in incomprehension.

  "The gods originally gave souls to living beings in order to record their thoughts and forms, so that their lives may be preserved after death and their deeds properly judged in the afterlife," Batak said. "For that reason, the gods, who had intimate knowledge of how souls worked, were capable of many miraculous things. So long as they had access to a person's soul, they could bring them back to life, even if their bodies had been reduced to ash and scattered into the winds. They could peer into their soul to examine their entire life from the moment they were born. They could restore a person's youth by regressing their forms to the state they once possessed. According to some stories, they could even create an identical copy of a person, indistinguishable from the original in every way."

*** Not going to say much except that souls are unable to actually 'run' minds. Like [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]] below said - without some kind of processor to do the actual thinking, souls are mindless.

If you asked an in-setting scholar where the mind resides, they would tell you it's in the brain. Clearly the brain has deep (and mostly unexplained) links to the soul, but that's where a person's thinking happens.

**** It seemed clear enough that minds are soulless.

I get that you don't want to say anything to spoil stuff but I would be super excited if you went more in depth with this sometime along the story.

The idea of the mind being a processor makes a lot of sense. I guess a fundemental question is whether the brain have local copies of the deep layer and the soul makes copies of this all the time, or whether the soul has a single deep layer that the mind can access.

I think that the latter would explain the most. Like how it's difficult to do permanent damage without diving into the deeep layer, simplify Alanic's postion, simplify the whole loop memory conservation business.

It does open the question as to whether you can trick the gods by changing your own memories.

I am also curious as to whether skills actually are in the mind. Clearly Zach's ability to throw giant boulders implies that his accuracy have caried over which would imply that skills are either in the mind or in the soul. I suppose they might just come from a connection of many different memories rather than being their own thing but it could be pretty cool if a sufficiently advanced mind mage could copy skills from other people onto themselves. People are already doing this with monster abilities.

  Clearly for most people in the loop, the mind does not go back on reset. There's still a lot we don't know about the function of the soul markers. One function might very simply be to make sure that the mind stays attached to the soul when the soul is moved back to the recreated body. So instead of re-emerging as the result of the physical processes, in Zorian and Zach's case the mind is impressed onto the physical body recreated for them.

** It seems that the mind is simply an emergent property of the brain, the soul has no actual use in the process of consciousness. This is in contrast to traditional notions of souls which are the consciousness of a person.

** I'd like to point out that shifters have two souls. Ever since I've done a reread I've felt that that fact could be a potential Chekhov's Gun. When you consider the link between minds and souls the ritual is even more interesting imo.

If you don't remember the two souls thing here's a direct quote of one of the early mentions ([[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/29/Mother-of-Learning][in chapter 29]]):

#+begin_quote
  "Shifters are people with two souls," Vani said. "Long in the past, the ancestors of the shifters enacted rituals that fused their souls with the souls of their chosen animals, allowing them to take the forms of the animals in question and even access some of the abilities of said animals in their human form. It is a very old form of magic that predates the Ikosian invasion of Altazia, and I'm sad to say that most shifter tribes have lost the knowledge of the original rituals they used to create their kind. These days, they grow in numbers purely through mundane reproduction, with children of shifters inheriting their parent's dual soul. There exist, however, tribes that retain the knowledge of ritual magic and soul mechanics necessary to perform the ritual in the modern age. While the purpose of such expertise is to turn regular humans into new members of the tribe, it may very well be general enough to help you with your issue."
