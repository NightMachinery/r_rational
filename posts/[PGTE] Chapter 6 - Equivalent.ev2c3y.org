** Damn, talk about rubbing salt in the wounds.

More then ever I agree with Blacks Rage Against The Heavens speech.

“None of it is earned. It is handed to them, and this offends me.”

*** Does her anger at the Heavens really make sense though? In this situation we see that the Heavens used their influence over creation to help the Stalwart Apostle while the Hells either did nothing or actively made things worse for the Scorched Apostle.

Shouldn't her Hatred thus be directed at the Hells for their poor treatment of their Champions? The decision of the Heavens to protect their champions and bend things in their favor in such a manner as to ensure that they can avoid excessive suffering seems like it is something that should be admired rather than disdained.

**** It's less that they protect their champions than that they fail to protect everyone else. They have the power to answer every prayer, but do so only sparingly. It reeks of hypocrisy.

The Hellgods, on the other hand, help nobody but themselves. They make their stance clear: do what you will with the power you bargain from us. We will not intervene to prevent your mistakes, or to temper your successes.

***** Do the Heavens have the power to protect everyone ? I understand that this appears to be what Catherine is assuming but I don't believe that this is accurate.

My understanding of the setting is that Creation was established as a something of a game between the forces of Heaven and Hell where they can compete to prove some kind of abstract point on the nature of Good and Evil. The status of Creation as a Contest between two sides would seem to mandate restrictions on the ability of each side to shape Creation. If the Heavens have the ability to "protect everyone" or otherwise ensure that everything always goes there way than the entire point of Creation would be made meaningless.

My perspective is that the existing evidence and logic indicates that the ability of Heaven to interfere in Creation is tightly limited. The absence of Heavenly providence saving the Scorched Apostle or other random individuals suffering all across Creation can be best understood as a need to most effectively use limited resources and work within the confines of the Game of Creation rather than a moral decision to give some humans a higher value than others.

****** It's less that Good doesn't give to everyone and more that Evil is the ones who give to the deserving. Evil is meritocratic, it gives to those that want power and are willing to work and sacrifice for it. Good meanwhile gives power to the virtuous who will use that power for good. In Cat's mind simply wanting to do good is useless. For twenty years her people were ruled by corrupt Praesi and while everyone agreed that they should be stopped no one stepped up and did it. Catherine is insulted by the thought that those people who /would/ do something, if only they had the power, would simply be given it when people like her who actually have the drive must earn every scrap.

******* Indeed. It is easy to forget that in Calernia it is Praes that is the meritocracy. Obviously the results haven't been what one hopes for (Black is not wrong when he says that Praes is a mould that must be broken) but, at least theoretically speaking, that meritocracy is just as good if not extremely preferable to say:

 

the Holy Roman Empire styled mess of Procer

the eternal dictatorships of Keter, the Golden Bloom and the Empire Ever Dark

the plutocracy of Mercantis

the hereditary oligarchy of Levant

the hereditary monarchy of Callow

the messier monarchies (or monarchies in all but name) of Helike, Penthes, and Nicae

the literal slavery of Stygia

the bureaucratically-enforced castes of Ashur and Delos

the theocracy of Atalante

the Orwellian nightmare mixed with true mob rule that is Bellerophon

******** I think that, at almost any point in the settings history, you'd rather live in Callow or Procer than Praes. Praes is a /terrible/ place to live, and that remains true under the Calamities.

And calling Praes a meritocracy is certainly misleading, what with the nobilities extreme inherited wealth and power and eugenics and such.

**** Now that she's working with heroes, I'm sure she's (generally) grateful for the bits of providence that swing her sides way. But I think I'm more sympathetic to Cat's view than most commenters I'm seeing. I'm willing to take Cat at her word that the vast majority of the time, putting one's trust in the heavens doesn't actually work---at least for people who aren't already Heroes/Chosen. My reading of the chapter is that neither the Scorched Apostate or the Stalwart Apostle were actually Named until they made their various choices in how to address the seeded plague problem (I was confused at first by Apostle but I think 1. she was a mage who used magic to detect the plague seeds 2. she responded by praying to above, and was given special Light powers and made the Stalwart Apostle 3. she was attacked by Revenant/zombies, and Grey Pilgrim stepped in.)

So we have two people faced with a horrible situation to be revolved, with very high stakes. One person decided they needed to step up and do whatever they could to resolve it---and as a "reward" he was branded a villain by the system in place, rejected by the heavens and embraced by below, no helping hand of providence for him. The other decides not to step up with her magic and try to solve the problem, and instead sits back and hopes that the Gods Above will solve things for her---and although this usually DOES NOT WORK, this time she happens to get embraced by the Heavens and given the benefits of providence. I don't think it's nutty for Cat to be enraged at a system that works like this, when in her view it is the Scorched Apostate who actually made what she considers the "right" choice.

Anyway, that's my take on it. It's not about whether it's good that the heavens step in and help some people---it's about the system of deciding who is worthy of that sort of protection.

  The relationship between those two was best described as cordial dislike, though I'd never quite managed to put a finger on the source of it.

** I really like the Kandra/Mistwraith esque feel to the new undead. Its conceptually not super new but the idea of infiltrators doing the whole kill and replace is at least uncommon. Like there's also the Callidus Assassins of Warhammer 40k but it's somewhat unusual of a trope.

** I get that Cat is hurting from her own failure and stresses, but she really needs to woman up, here.

The way her world operates, when a new Villain comes into existence with the blessing of Below, then Above gets its turn to grant power onto a mortal who becomes a new Hero.

Up until now, this process has been going on for awhile, and almost invariably results in one killing the other or the two 'paired' hero/villain being set up as potent rivals for a duration. Over time, those balanced out.

Cat was the first one to take what is essentially a zero sum game and make it into a net positive benefit against the Dead King. Instead of just one useful hero or villain out of every 'spawning', now she gets *two* to add to her cause.

All she has to do is protect them and train them well until they can have a group to work with or at least take care of themselves, then set them on her Enemy.

Yeah, she screwed up, and it hurts, but she really doesn't have to change much. She has the ability to win, as she will invariably unbalance the 'game' in her favor. She just has to be smart and *extremely* proactive about recovering the new Hero and Villain ASAP. If she can't do it herself because she's just one woman, then she needs to assign an 'Adventurer Team' (composed of at least one Hero and one Villain) to the specific task of finding, acquiring, and safely evacuating these Hero/Villain pairs as quickly and efficiently as possible. Get them lots of practice and experience, so they get very good at their jobs, and if they aren't enough, they can train the 2nd and later generations of these 'Adventurer Teams' until she has enough supply to meet the demand.
