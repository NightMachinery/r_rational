** Narratively kinda a weird chapter.

The first half was telling us about how great Vesena was. To the extent I was wondering why they hadn't steamrolled the rest of the drow, if they were the only ones who still had meaningful tactics and these special seige engines, and and why we haven't heard about these super badass soldiers before. But then they spent the second half of it being absolutely slaughtered.

Feels like a weird worf effect situation where they are bigged up only to fail showing how scary the dead kings army is, which was already pretty well established.

In universe, the shift is partially explained by the recognition from Cat that although they had the appearance of a true army it was only skin deep, and they reverted to the same bad tactics as the other sigils when push comes to shove. But I'm still not sure how much of the original positive description was accurate, and how they are meant to fit in with the relative strength of the other drow.

*** I was a bit taken back too, as we've had Rumena built up as such a badass, but in retrospect I think it's fair. Cat did not penetrate deep into the Empire Ever Dark, and when she emerged it was not with the bulk of drow, just those on hand. Since it was made explicit that sigils get tougher as you go further inward, it makes sense to me that there are numerous sigils and mighty we haven't heard of who would put the drow we've seen to shame---and there's no real reason they would have been specifically named in the last book, since they weren't the ones to initially emerge with Cat. I imagine that just as everyone else in Rumena's city formerd into a cabal to keep him from running rampant, various powerful sigils in Vesena's areas similarly formed a cabal for mutual protection.

I think this chapter more about showing how strong the Dead King is. Because of how the Drow were built up last book, I'd started to get the impression that the drow were really going to tip the scale here and change the whole nature of the war. But here we're shown a devastatingly powerful group of drow suffering heavily once the Dead King has had a chance to adapt to them.

Another in-universe explanation is that the Sisters want to convey both that the current relative equilibrium on the southern front is mostly the Dead King going for attrition rather than overwhelming wave of undead vulnerable to Named, and that the troops that would otherwise be waiting to stamp down the breakthroughs in Procer can't be faced by the human armies alone. They picked something Rumena has already assessed to be a showcase of how Neshamah can exploit the vulnerabilities in an opposing force he's had a couple of years to study: sure, the Revenant is the same one a young Named like Blade of Mercy fought close enough to think that he killed her, but the whole point of the buildup is that the reserves they'll have to fight through are deeper than it seems from Cleves.
