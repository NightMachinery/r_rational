Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I propose a new term, "retrodictable", to refer to events whose causes are clear in hindsight, even if they may not have been clear initially. In other words, a "retrodictable" event is one that you can look back on and say, "I /could/ have seen that one coming, if only I were quicker on the uptake."

Right now, we use the word "predictable" to encompass both this usage (something that you /could/ have predicted in advance, e.g. "Ugh, that was so /predictable/, how did I /miss/ that") and the other, more obvious usage (something that you /actually did/ predict in advance, e.g. "Haha, that was so predictable, it was almost too easy"). Given the prevalence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias][hindsight bias]], I think it's important to distinguish between cases in which you /did not/ predict the event in advance (even if, looking back, there were obvious indicators that you could have picked up on, potentially) and cases in which you /actually did/ predict it. Hence, "retrodictable", if successfully introduced as a term, would specifically refer to the former case, thereby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_overload][freeing up]] the word "predictable" to refer purely to the latter.

Examples:

1. The notion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank][measuring the importance of a website via the proxy measure of how many times that site was linked to by other sites]] is an example of something that is /retrodictable/ but not /predictable/: obviously a good idea in hindsight, despite the fact that it took [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine#History][over a decade]] for said idea to actually be implemented and achieve prominence.
2. My drive to work taking longer than usual due to traffic is an example of something that is both /retrodictable and predictable/. More generally, anything you /actually/ predicted in advance is obviously and trivially retrodictable. (This means that even if "retrodictable" becomes accepted terminology, you'll almost never use it when talking about something you successfully predicted.)
3. Finally, for an example of something that was /neither retrodictable nor predictable/, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump][this guy]].

*** Is it worth making up a new word just to make "predictable in hindsight" two syllables shorter?

People do already say "predictable in hindsight" or "predictable in retrospect" all the time, so to the extent that new terminology would give people a new concept to use, the new concept already exists.

**** The idea is not to introduce a new concept, but to prevent a single word (in this case "predictable") from referring to two distinct concepts. While it would be nice if people could effortlessly maintain mental distinctions between similar concepts, in practice all of us associate words with particular mental "buckets" or "categories", and associating two different categories to the /same/ word can cause people to commit [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/nw/fallacies_of_compression/][category errors]]. Adding the words "in retrospect" or "in hindsight" does little to change this, unfortunately, and also (from an aesthetic viewpoint) makes about as much sense as saying "the day after yesterday" instead of just "today".

*** I don't think they really refer to two different concepts.

Consider a puzzle that you solve after an hour of effort. The solution is simple and elegant, so you wonder how it eluded you so long. You might say to yourself, "Ugh, that was so easy, how didn't I get it?".

Likewise, if you did get it instantly, you might think to yourself, "Well that was easy."

If you want to separate the two types of retrospective hindsight ("I was right, it was X." and "I was wrong, turns out it was X."), I'd recommend using a modifying word or phrase rather than inventing new words for all possible X.

*** I think example 3 is flawed. Just because you don't currently understand the causes, even in hindsight, doesn't mean that it couldn't be predicted; we might not have enough understanding yet, but in time it will probably come. Many people did correctly predict the outcome. So as not to remove all meaning from the word "predictable", I'm willing to say that since the vast majority of people incorrectly predicted the outcome with a high level of certainty (betting odds on the night of the election were 4-1 against), that it was in fact unpredictable. Then again, if [[http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8889][this]] is correct, then perhaps it really was retrodictable.

What you really want as an example is something like the outcome of a die roll. The outcome cannot be predicted from the initial conditions, no matter how much analysis is performed. Or, sufficient analysis would be complex and take too many resources to be performed before the event actually occurs.

  talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/JapaneseGameShows]]
#+end_quote

OK, I don't watch any Japanese game shows, but last year I watched the entire catalogue of The Genius, a korean reality/game show (apparently they're called variety shows, as in [[/r/koreanvariety]]). I think it's a show that regulars on [[/r/rational]] would enjoy; people do mini strategy games (of the werewolf/mafia sort of genre, of the nim sort of genre, games requiring alliances, logic games, etc) and there are often ways to break the game by thinking laterally. The contestants are almost universally extremely smart and come up with strategies that leave you in awe.

The first season is on youtube; the other seasons are linked from the [[/r/TheGenius]] subreddit or the tumblr of bumdiddlyumptious (the fan who subs it).

Season 1: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpwIgWPfNvc]] (there's a playlist on youtube)

Note: It's in Korean with subtitles. You get used to it. I'm face blind (for real) and can tell the contestants apart after a few episodes (but I can never remember their occupations; they're Korean celebrities and apparently some of them are more than a little famous). That said, a cheat sheet will no doubt be useful at least at the start: [[http://www.purplerockpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Genius-season-1-cast-cheat-sheet-by-Angie-Caunce.jpg]]

Note 2: Each episode is 1 hour 10 minutes long. It's divided into two segments, a main match and a death match, so there's a natural pausing place at least.

Note 3: There's a death match game that they use a couple of times called tactical yutnori. It is a traditional korean board game and it's... not fun for a westerner to watch. The subber does quick subtitles explaining the rules. Either suffer through it or just skip it. There's a couple of really excellent strategic moves that happen in tactical yutnori but it's probably not worth 30 minutes of your life.

** So, random question for everyone:

If an alien confederation invaded earth tomorrow, and made the following two offers:

1) Humanity would have free access to all of its non-war related technology, including space travel to terraform and colonize other planets and medicine that could extend lifespans.

2) Earth is now a vassal planet to the alien's civilization, and, while very local matters would most likely be left alone, all countries must give up their sovereignty and all humans must follow alien laws.

Who here would be inclined to accept alien rule, and who here would be inclined to resist it through violence? I understand that the particulars of the two points matters a lot (particularly what laws might be required for 2), but I'm curious how much the core concepts push people to choose one way or another.

*** The devil is in the details here. We have to follow alien laws, but do alien values match human values? If so, then we've got a sort of benevolent dictator, but if not, it might not matter how much autonomy we ostensibly have if they're imposing their laws on us.

Do they outlaw life-extending technology? Big minus.

Do they have laws which effectively reduce government corruption? Mid-size plus.

Do they have laws which prevent nuclear weapons from being used without alien-tech-level retaliation preventing the devastation? Mid-size plus.

I'd hear them out, though. I'm not dedicated to 'the human species' being fully dominant above all else. The extent that the human race is thriving relates more to the tech level, material wealthiness, and intellectual freedom of the world as a whole. Right now we're doing pretty good with that, what with science and computers and machines, but the title of 'independent' is rather hollow compared to improving that further.

*** Unless the laws we have to follow are extremely horrific, I would accept alien rule. My reasoning is that every time a similar situation in human history with a more powerful nation interacting with a weaker nation occurred, the smaller culture has almost always been wiped out (intentionally or not) via conquering or assimilation. Better to live on as an independent minority rather than an assimilated one.

While things would be different with aliens instead of humans, it's still unlikely to be easy for us to sustain our culture in the face of technological superiority and rapid societal change. Agreeing to become a vassal would allow us to adapt to transitioning to an interplanetary civilization without having to deal with fighting against a superior foe.

If the aliens make the same deal /and/ we don't have to worry about being conquered at all with the only con is that we lose out on access to the technology, then I would still agree to the same deal as above.

I would only argue for resistance if the gap is largely in space-faring technology and that we could catch up to the aliens in a fairly short time span (maybe two decades?) or if their laws are so horrific that dying would be better.

*** 1) is a bit unclear because almost all tech is war-related, but I don't think it matters a lot. It also depends on what the alien laws are. Lastly, is their an actual choice? Or would the aliens assume direct control if we refuse?

I think there will be a clear division in the population itself. After a few weeks of considering the implications, I think most pro-science people and people who don't accord value to silly things like borders would agree. But that group would be very small. Patriots, traditionalists and religious people would never agree to give up their sovereignty and their ways.

Either way, governments cannot just agree to terms like these. But the good choice in my opinion would be to accept.

*** Relevant: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq4SSlsZ_p0]]

It really depends on how alien law works, but I don't think there any possible set of laws that would stop all ongoing conflicts. War and violence don't happen in a vacuum; even if you removed all of the guns in Syria, you're still left with a ton of people, some of them with very legitimate grievances (the government killed/oppressed my kin), with strongly incompatible opinions of how their country should be ruled.

Peace-keeping aside, I'd expect most countries to flat out refuse the alien rule. Countries are really touchy about their sovereignty, and no one would seriously consider submitting themselves to an alien empire, especially if the first thing the aliens do is announce that the Earth is now part of the Galactic Federation whether Earthlings like it or not.

I mean, even if their laws seem reasonable, we have no reason to believe they're not just trying to get us to disarm so they can more easily enslave us or whatever.

*** I'll take autonomy, please.

This scenario isn't all that different from ones we've seen on earth. A more powerful nation comes along, and starts colonizing distant lands. Colonial governors don't generally impose their will too much on the local populace, while providing various forms of infrastructure and technology... sometimes it's worse for the local populace, sometimes better. Worst case, we end up being killed off like various Native American tribes. Best case, we end up like Hong Kong. Still not a great deal.

Then again, perhaps if we don't take the deal, we end up in an even worse position: perpetually a third world planet in galactic civilization that can't get it's act together, can't unify, and is perpetually asking for handouts. We end up as the Nigerian scammers of the galaxy.

I think I'll risk that. Besides, I'd hate to take a crappy deal just because it was the first to come along and be forced to pass up better ones later on. Satisficing is a real risk.

*** As a personal decision that effects only myself, I instinctively lean towards 1. Even if the alien society isn't much better than our own, I still like the idea of participating in something larger than myself and I have found the process of doing so in our world needlessly difficult thanks to my mental disorders. I'm in a depressed enough state of mind where I automatically envision this choice as an escapist fantasy purely because I'm dissatisfied with my life as it currently is and improving it isn't easy. I'm ready to hand over some autonomy in exchange for increased general happiness, which makes me think I can't be trusted to weigh the pros and cons of such a decision.

However, it's not clear what the pros and cons actually are from a political perspective. You didn't give any specifics about what consequences there would be for alien rule aside from their leaders being able to overrule our leaders. It's hard to have a concrete debate about whether it's better to be a nation or a state when the only known difference is access to technology/trade we don't currently have. I think it comes down to whether you generally value freedom or security over the other, which I go back and forth on depending on the specifics of each. I'm comfortable with Big Brother watching me despite the risk of abuses of power, but I zealously oppose banning human-operated vehicles even though I know it would save lives.

--------------

So the deadline for the voxel prototype is up! [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0LYycfi-K18eXdXS3NWd0pTQnc?usp=sharing][Here is a folder with various zip files to download]].  There are builds for Windows, Mac, and Linux, in x86 and x64 builds whenever possible.  If you download it, please let me know below if it ran and how it ran, on what OS.  I only really have a Windows 10 machine, so getting a feel for how things run on other setups is valuable info to have, if only so I have a heads up for issues.

In the demo, use ESDF to move your cylinder avatar around (because screw WASD).  I would not advise running in fullscreen mode, as I didn't actually hook up any way to exit the program, so stick to windowed mode.

For those of you too lazy to download anything, here's a gif showing everything you're missing:

[[http://i.imgur.com/5P3SqCa.gifv]]

That gif pretty much shows all of it, lol.  Each color is a separate chunk, and as you can see in the upper half, chunks are dynamically being loaded and unloaded as you move around.  Having a restricted camera angle that doesn't include the horizon /really/ helps keep everything manageable.  

--------------

The intent was to get as far as setting up a wrapping map, but that didn't happen in the two weeks I gave myself.  The game will have a game world shaped roughly like a cylinder: if you go east or west, you'll wrap as one might expect, and then if you go north or south, eventually you'll hit a special zone that will permit you to take a shortcut to the other side of the world, while preserving the mirrored nature of such a layout.

Here's an image illustrating what I mean:

[[http://i.imgur.com/Gzyqr9C.png]]

The black outline represents the actual map.  Going past the east/west borders will spawn chunks that are just referring to data within the main map.  Going past the north pole boundary will flip the world; from that point on, traveling up will mean heading south, and everything will be laid out the way one would expect. If you travel past the south pole (or go back over the north pole), things will again reverse to the original view.

At least, that's the goal.  I didn't actually get to the point to see if it will be technically feasible; if it turns out to be too big a headache, I'll just go with a torus-shaped world, where crossing the northern border will plop you at the bottom of the map, like old final fantasy games.

----  

This prototype month has been quite enlightening.  Plenty of important design decisions were made, but most importantly I discovered how /not/ to try and keep the motivation train going.  I will not /ever/ in the future place two deadlines back-to-back like this.  Having one after the other left me zero flexibility and more than once the stress simply piled up, resulting in me playing Dota for six hours as a coping mechanism. This is the direct cause of why I didn't attain my goals for this voxel demo, as I spent the first week stressing out before I reeled in my aim.

It was also an important lesson in scoping (again): trying to make a meaningful voxel prototype, /and/ explore a brand new game engine (Xenko) /and/ clean up the previous prototype was a foolish pipe-dream.  I should have done one, then the other, and not tried to do it all at once.

I /did/, however, enjoy having /some/ sort of deadline, and I also enjoyed letting the community vote on what to work on.  I doubt that things will be so open-ended to just let people pick what they want me to work on, but when forks in the road come up, I'll try and give y'all a chance to chime in.

--------------

Visual Studio 2017 has been released, which was what I was waiting on to begin the project proper.  However, given how close both of the prototypes are to /actually/ being complete, I'm going to spend another week getting them both to the point of, y'know, containing the thing they were designed to explore.  So next week, I'll have two shiny new builds, one for each prototype, hopefully able to be freely configured so I can ask your opinion on the way certain things feel.

*** Also, I had a "holy shit" moment while working on the chunk loading/unloading. The gif (and the demo) makes it look like all sorts of chunks are coming in and out seemingly at random, but it /is/ following a pattern.

See, I already have code in place that maps coordinates: if you try to request coordinate [1001, 1002] and the grid is only 100 x 100, then my code will automatically transpose your request to [1, 2]. This was in anticipation of getting wrapping working, but I didn't really have a use case for it.

A day later, I'm getting the chunks to load and unload and it looks like it's just throwing up garbage and hoping it works, but after some experimentation I realized that it's loading the right chunks, they're just not in the right place! The loader is expecting such-and-such a coordinate off to the right, which my code dutifully translates to the left, which then gets loaded, a full phase out of position.

Some pictures to illustrate:

*** T-T it's my fault. I stuck a link shortener in my weekly post to slyly get info on how many downloads went out, and got shut down by the spam filter. I removed it and messaged the mods, hopefully it's reapproved. I don't think I'm supposed to just repost in such a situation.

** Would anyone be willing to argue for, or at least steelman, the artistic value of Warhol? My current opinion is that he's ok, but a bit over celebrated for his early work, coasted off Pop Art, and then did typical weird-but-not-really-good stuff like filming someone sleeping for six hours.

(Caveats: I'm not an expert in art, and although I try to overcompensate for stereotypical STEM anti-art thinking, I can't tell if its affecting me here)

My understanding of the modern art scene is that much, if not most, of it is a dialogue with other artists. At some point, they stopped trying to talk to you and me and focused on talking with each other, which is why so many art movements are responses to one another.

But art remains high-class, so you still get people going "ooh" and "ah" over stuff that they don't actually understand because they haven't studied art history (or at least the history of that movement and artist).

Imagine that it became popular for American poets to write in Esperanto rather than English. You and I wouldn't get what they're saying, and would wonder why particular pieces of work were so popular when they're unintelligible gibberish, but that's because we aren't fluent in Esperanto.

*** So to establish a basis for this argument,

- Andy Warhol is a well-known artist
- Thus, many people have seen his art
- And to have gotten to be so recognized, many people need to have /enjoyed/ his art

So since his art generated positive utility, it has nonzero artistic value.

But that's not quite what you asked me to argue.

For the question of whether Warhol is celebrated disproportionately to the artistic value of the works he created, We kind of need to define what "disproportionately" means in this context. Since you're the person that asked to be convinced, I'll let you come up with your own definition, whether objective, or with reference to other artists.

Though a short draft of an argument would be artists like warhol that can create iconic works (ex. the soup cans, the neon portraints) they wouldn't have been created, were it not for that artist are far rarer than, say, interchangeable pop singers who sing fairly derivative works yet are celebrated at about the same level. Therefore Warhol falls solidly on the right side of the originalness to popularity bell curve, albeit not far to the end like the true visionaries.

** [[https://lostboyevsky.bandcamp.com/track/were-living-in-a-golden-age-but-humanity-might-go-extinct][This awesome rap]] has been making rounds across the rationalist-sphere.

I'm really enjoying it.

Awesome rhymes like "reading Venkatesh Rao in Bangladesh now" and "broadcasting live from a cottage in Bulgaria let's build some eco-cities and eradicate malaria".
