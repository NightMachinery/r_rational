** So I tried reading this and got maybe 8 chapters in before I realized I just wasn't enjoying it. I loved MM, and the worldbuilding they did is clearly very good, but there's nothing compelling in the plot or characters yet early on. Do others have opinions on where it really kicks off, or is it maybe just not for me?

*** You could make an argument that it kicks off in Ch. 18 (the beginning of Volume II), but I don't think you're more likely to enjoy the story at that point if you don't by Ch. 8. That's not really a major divergence point.

I might suggest reading Ch. 17, the interlude between Volumes I and II, which is a stand-alone story set in the late 21st century, even if you don't read anything else afterwards.

**** Okay, I read it and it was enjoyable, though again it just felt like it had good worldbuilding rather than engaging characters, and the plot was hard to enjoy because I already knew where it was going. Might have enjoyed it more if I didn't know it was a magical girl story already, but even then the detective just felt... soulless, somehow. Dunno, maybe there's just something about the writing style that isn't meshing for me. Ah well, thanks anyway!

** I literally caught up this morning, and was disappointed that there seemed to be such a long interval between updates and that I'd probably have to wait a while. NOPE, wait 12 hours and BAM.
