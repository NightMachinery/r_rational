Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** This is a somewhat meta:

How do you organize your worldbuilding documents?

For me, the biggest things tend to be Geography (what's where), History (what happened), Magic and Technology (what people can do), and Movers and Shakers (who's who). Everything else is subordinate to that; climate, crops, and trade all go under geography, religion, corporations, organizations all go under Movers and Shakers, etc. There's a lot of cross-filing though, since there's obviously a ton of overlap.

One solution might be to have a wiki, but in my experience that's a little bit heavy-weight, and you end up with a lot of stubs, and it can spread things out too much to actually be satisfying as a picture of an imagined place.

(I'm generally happy with my organizational method, but would be curious to know what practices other people use.)

Edit: I tend to share these often, but here are four examples of how my docs look, in various states of done: [[http://maguseuropa.wikidot.com/][Magus Europa]] (done on wiki), [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13O76ht9K_WfkL__kmGG0meklYffpYcDsJqlFBNADxmc/edit?usp=sharing][Altered Chorus]], [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcIpahJPMl5xKgd3Fz_fghCANHI-e8y8F9FmyWh4Y6g/edit?usp=sharing][Red Stairs/Blue Stairs]] + [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8Jl1IVj-kObdCAd_CGTYxfddsFusgiQ70aAALsYajY/edit?usp=sharing][timeline]], [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEEMqsW05SEGhp42JLmHOTVy_elHOXIXGJfpKbvqH-U/edit?usp=sharing][Island Critters]]

*** With both game-mastering and writing, I tend to work bottom up rather than top down: What will matter to the characters and how will that be revealed to the players or the readers in a way that keeps them intrigued?

So my world-building is usually organized by major character, branching out like a tree (backwards and forwards, roots and leaves) into the corners of the world that made them and the ones they'll interact with later: Who and what they know, who and what will get in their way, how these forces tie together.

Minor characters that become major can peel out into files of their own, sometimes pulling information that directly relates to them from several previous files, where it becomes references to that character instead so that I keep my cast as manageable as possible. What was once history, bureaucracy, or background color becomes personified... and this figure becomes the go-to source for exposition on whatever.

All of this also tends to hamper scope expansion. Individual characters rarely wind up changing the world because everything's defined by its local relevance and connection rather than its fundamental traits and over-arching purpose. That's what I tell myself, anyway... players left to their own devices still want to kidnap the president.

*** Often, I don't actually /have/ documents. I keep things mostly in my head, and plan out plotlines based on the personalities and abilities of the characters involved; the geography and history are merely /what they need to be to make the story work/, whatever the story is at the time, and are subject to change any time that the story needs something else (and the original idea hasn't had any major impact on the plot yet).

(The one time I did actually draw up a document, it was because the story involved time travel, and the antagonist was experiencing the events of the story in a different order to the protagonists - keeping that straight did require a document).

There will often be hidden things in my stories - forces that move at a layer beyond the most obvious. But, unless it actually turns out to be important to the plot in some way, I couldn't tell you where the nearest ocean is to my protagonists, or when their country was last at war (or with whom).

** so, this is just an idea if anyone is familiar with the material maybe it would be fun to discuss here.

I am going to run a game of mage the ascension in a few weeks (we are making characters on sunday hopefully) where my plan for the main plot of the game (I encourage players to setup side plots both in the game and during character creation) will be a technocracy version of star trek. The original idea was to run a post "false technocratic victory" and "post ascension war" game but the players were mostly running technocrats and based on some of their character ideas and listening to "the greatest generation" podcast I thought this could be a fun game idea.

My thoughts on the mechanics would be much more hub based than star trek giving them points to set up a base and ship to start out, making some drama at home for them to need to go back to reality every game or two to keep them grounded while they explore the umbra.
