** While thats a common outside look of how some superpowers work, actually changing physic laws is a bad idea*TM. Depending on how technical you want to get, actually changing the mass of your arm is a terrible idea unless you have some sort of protective effect especially for the user. Its called Manton Effect in superpower setting Worm for example.

Why? Take your mass increase example. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_chemistry]] Electrons around a heavy atomic nuclus experience relativistic mass increase, gold for example about 20%. This changes the electrons orbits, enough so that gold is gold instead of silvery!

Biochemistry is finicky enough that random mass changes would seriously mess it up.

TLDR: physic law benders can just hurt people by directly changing their opponents bodies. Increase van der waals forces until their blood sticks in their veins. Negate electrostatic force to have them crumble into radioactive dust.

** There's a phrase ‘the map doesn't equal the territory'.

Everything is relativistic - at what level is physics manipulated? Quantum levels? Subatomic? Newtonian levels of physics understanding? Unless you plan to write a comprehensive physics system then you need to have some form of cut off where you can hand wave questions away - you could for example have the main user have some form of addition organelle which connects to the brain which links to some extra dimensionary physics manipulation device which transcribes the users intentions to real world effects. You can decide what level of intent the system requires and leaves the requirement to explain every in and out of how it actually works. This is how most magic systems set in a real world environment get around the problem - in Harry Potter set phrases and motions result in set effects for example

** Wouldn't it amount to being able to do anything at all? At least if you don't limit it by saying that your character must explicitly calculate in his mind what and how much does he want to change, accounting for all relevant side effects (i.e. if he thinks "I want to increase my arm's acceleration a hundred times from what it is now", he gets exactly that, but the result quite likely wouldn't be pleasant to him).

To paraphrase Terry Pratchett, seven-league boots seem like a great idea until you think about the consequences of putting one foot twenty-one miles in front of the other.

** If you want it to make sense, creating a power based on manipulating physics seems like a bad idea if you don't have a good grasp on physics.

** Your power: control of collisions with gaseous molecules.

Air is made up of a bunch of molecules, mostly O2 and N2. These molecules are moving quickly and bouncing off of everything creating air pressure. How fast they are going depends on the temperature. Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy, but it doesn't manifest as wind because it's disordered - going every which way. Because of this disorder, movement from temperature is not visible except on a very small scale - it's called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion][Brownian motion]].

This superpower redirects any air bouncing off the skin in a single direction. If you wanted to do less math about how fast it would go but violate more laws of physics, you could concentrate the kinetic energy from most of the air hitting you to a small amount of gas that is shot out in a specific direction. The randomness of the universe is decreased as this superpower is used, which breaks some of the laws of physics, but superpowers have to use handwavium somewhere. It would be more complicated but possible to pass the entropy on to whoever or whatever receives the wind as some sort of decay effect.

To make it cooler, it could either take heat away from the air super or the air could be cold when it hits the target. I'm leaning toward the first as it is a better use limiter (can't send too much air or you'll freeze) and makes more sense with the physics.

Factors that influence your powers:

- Skin/power surface exposed to air (more surface area = more wind)
- Ambient temperature (warmer air -> more wind)
- Wind (wind on skin -> increase power but decrease range in any direction except with the wind)
- Air pressure. If the air pressure and wind pressure combined are high enough, you could possibly fly by redirecting the air in the right direction. This would take some math I'm not ready to do right now to find the minimum pressure.

You can use specialized gases as part of your equipment:

- Heavy gases (e.g. radon, CF4) would make a stronger attack
- You are immune to poisonous gases and can send any you're in contact with out as an attack. You can store them inside yourself (lungs, large intestine)

** What exactly does "altering physics" mean? Physics is just our description of how the world fundamentally works. Isn't it just "alter the world"?

** Yeah, unaccounted-for side effects will get you here. Greg Egan has written whole book series about how the world would be different if you flipped just one of the signs in one of the equations of relativity, and even he had to fudge some things. Hard.
