Games in fiction face a lot of challenges. The first big hurdle you have to get over is the exposition one; if you want a game to be central to the plot (or even tangential to the plot) you need to establish for the audience how the game is played, what the goals are, etc. Picking a popular game you can expect your intended audience to be familiar with (chess, poker, baduk, etc.) mitigates this somewhat.

How you /show/ games is a particular problem in prose fiction. Chess is somewhat notorious for being a "smart guy" game, in part because it's easy to say "he was playing a mean game of chess" and no one expects the author to actually show some good chess moves, since a full description of the board would be tedious and/or incomprehensible to most people. Physical games (sports) lend themselves better to description in text, probably because there's more to describe.

It's also possible to skimp on the actual rules and just go by the story beats, which I've seen used effectively a few times; by positioning the narrative a few levels up from the actual mechanics of the game itself, the author doesn't need to invent a game from scratch. However, this means that you aren't as able to use the game to solve plot problems, lest it just seem like author fiat (and doing games in prose by skimping on the rules is, I feel, inherently less rational).
