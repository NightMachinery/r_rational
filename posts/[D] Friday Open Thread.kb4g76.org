Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  "There's no question this has been a neglected issue," said Jones, who has drawn on lessons from his long career in public health epidemiology and disease prevention in sounding the alarm throughout Massachusetts and with former CDC colleagues over the past few years. The first step, he said, is "letting people know what the risks are - particularly when they can be substantial, life-threatening risks that can kill kids."

  One of the clearest signals emerging in the scientific literature is the connection between cooking with gas and childhood asthma - a disease suffered by people of color and lower-income groups at much higher rates than the rest of the population. A 2013 meta-analysis of 41 studies found that children living in homes with gas stoves had a 42% higher risk of experiencing asthma symptoms, and, over their lifetime, a 24% increase in the risk of being diagnosed with asthma. That study confirmed, in turn, what a 1992 meta-analysis found: Children exposed to higher levels of indoor NO2 (at an increment "comparable to the increase resulting from exposure to a gas stove") had an elevated risk of respiratory illness. More recently, a 2018 study from the University of Queensland found that in Australia, where 38% of households rely on gas stoves for cooking, more than 12% of the total burden of childhood asthma was attributable to their use.

  Meanwhile, troubling new findings suggest that exposure to NO2 - the primary pollutant of concern from gas appliances - could compound the dangers of the novel coronavirus in communities that are already at higher risk of infection and of dying from the disease. A recent peer-reviewed study led by researchers at Emory University examined Covid-19 mortality data in more than 3,000 US counties, and found that long-term exposure to elevated NO2 was correlated with a higher risk of death from Covid-19 - and that NO2 appeared to be more dangerous than particulate matter or ozone.

  The hazards now have a growing chorus of scientists and public health experts insisting that better and stricter oversight of burning gas indoors - a health threat that has been hiding in plain sight for decades, they say - can no longer be ignored. "It's fundamental and imperative," said Jones. "We ought to get up on the rooftops and shout about it."

  The cumulative evidence was enough for the venerable New England Journal of Medicine to publish an editorial in January recommending that "new gas appliances be removed from the market." It was co-authored by Howard Frumkin, a former director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, which is responsible for investigating environmental drivers of illness and promulgating guidance about those risk factors.

  Despite such calls - and despite compelling evidence that gas appliances can produce levels of air pollution inside homes that would be illegal outdoors in the US - indoor air quality remains entirely unregulated in the US today, and gas appliances largely maintain their industry-manufactured reputation as "clean." The Environmental Protection Agency only monitors pollutants in outdoor air. And while building codes typically require natural gas furnaces and water heaters to be vented outside, many states lack requirements that natural gas cooking stoves be vented to the outdoors.

****** The kitchen in the home I lived in from 3-years-old to 19-years-old was in the middle of the house and didn't have a single window in it. It was a newly constructed home when we moved in. Not everyone has a window in their kitchen. And even if "having a window in the kitchen" is the norm, not everyone thinks that way - I actually feel like opening a window to vent out the kitchen every time you cook probably isn't the norm for most people. People like the smell of cooking, and I don't think people in general would think they needed ventilation unless they were cooking something particularly pungent.

I had this stove that always has this smoky-smell despite best efforts to clean it out of food stains, so it had to air out with an open window just to keep the smoke detector from going off. And now it's a quirky habit of mine I guess.

***** Then you will probably really like these two books! You will probably also like Penelope Leach's "Your Baby And Child" when the time comes.

I am also going to offer two pieces of totally unsolicited advice:

- Get two dozen cloth diapers. Not to use as diapers; to use as "burp cloths" (aka something for a baby to regurgitate or dribble mostly-undigested milk onto, which they do more or less constantly for about six months). I'm not kidding about two dozen.
- everyone will be judgmental about literally everything. Ignore them. As long as your baby is fed (breast milk vs formula matters not at all compared to fed vs not adequately fed), is kept warm enough, does not suffer spinal/cranial damage, and is given affection and enrichment, you're doing fine by the baby and should worry about making sure you and your wife are happy and loving each other.

Anyway, mazel tov! Welcome to the parent club! We talk about nothing but our babies because the sleep deprivation means nothing else actually serializes properly to disk!

**** Seconding /Cribsheet: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool/. I haven't read the other, pre/post natal nutrition is even more socially hazardous than regular nutrition. I'd have your wife read it if possible, although ideally you both read everything "parenting" anyway.

Cribsheet is full of good information and entertaining, but it's biggest benefit is making you a more robust parent. It helps you understand and evaluate the millions of different pieces of advice and parenting philosophies you're going to hear.

Good luck!

  Young children have the highest risk of having a serious case of disease that could cause hospitalization or death. Delaying or spreading out vaccine doses leaves your child unprotected during the time when they need vaccine protection the most.

** A note for anybody who reads, or used to read, Pyrebound: I'm aware it's been like four months now. I've written and rewritten update 15.4 so many times I've quite literally lost count, each time deciding after four or five pages of writing that it just wasn't how I wanted to tell it. I could also bring up school or work or what-have-you, but mostly it's that I'm getting close to the end and I want to be very careful about sticking the landing here.

I just finished the semester, and looked forward to spending break finally finishing the update. I got home from work yesterday, popped open my writing laptop which had worked just fine that afternoon, and got a warning that a cooling fan wasn't working right and if I tried to run it I'd risk melting the processor or some such. Fun. So, yeah. I'll get the thing fixed and hopefully that will be before school starts up again. Argh.

Bottom line: I haven't given up on the story. It's just run into one hell of a rut. Thanks for your patience.

I'd always known that animal agriculture was harmful, but around the beginning of this year someone here prompted me to do a utility calculation on just _how_ harmful, per person, the impact was -- something on the order of ten years of worse-than-death suffering per year per consumer, plus many other negative externalities

This is the most important thing this community ever brought to my attention, and perhaps the absolute highest impact area for effective altruism due to the sheer scale of suffering, as well as environmental and climate damage, so thank you

**** That infographic is excellent! but I find that a full commitment is much more tenable; until this year I was of the mindset of just reducing consumption under the idea that if everyone reduces consumption and influences each other to reduce consumption, it is more impactful than if only a couple people stop completely.

But, I found that instead of influencing people to reduce consumption, instead the people around me influenced me to increase consumption. Since stopping completely, the opposite has been true -- the people around me have started going vegan as well.

What really pushed me to full commitment was that even a small fraction of the average consumer's lifestyle still has a _massive_ impact on the animals -- dividing a decade of unnecessary suffering each year by two or three is still unacceptable.

Plus if one is to campaign on behalf of the animals, too, it is even more important to have a full commitment.

*** Congrats! My new boyfriend just recently told me he was going vegan again, and it's just thrilling to have more people in the fold.

I am excited to have you. It's great to have the cognitive dissonance leave your brain, and feel yourself able to consider things more genuinely. That was the most unexpected benefit.

Make sure you pay attention to your nutrition - people overblow how difficult it is, but it's not trivial especcially if you started from a bad diet. I read the book /Vegan For Life/ a few years back and found it very accessible.

(Do you have any idea who it was? I wonder if it was me - doubt it, but I did post some stuff about veganism early in the year)

** I've been getting into old-school RPG randomizers. Played SMRPG (great!), Earthbound (good but pretty intense), and FF6 (so many rough edges but a lot of potential and impressive work by the dev). I'm going to tackle FF1 randomizer next, but I'm still psyching myself up for it a bit.

Routing for RPG randomizers isn't as interesting as for adventure games with item-based progression, like Zelda and Metroid. However, randomized equipment and stats and stuff give them a more reliable source of things to randomize that might be interesting, so more of these games turn out at least okay than that genre. Randomizers for Metroid-esque games tend to yield unapproachably hardcore results, while most Zelda-esque games have hub-and-spoke world design that doesn't randomize well (with ALTTP and LA being the big exceptions).

I think game randomizers might become mainstream in some way in the next few years. The communities are very organized and committed, and a lot of them are growing. Simultaneously playing a game while figuring out routing decisions is a pretty fun mental juggling act (the part this community might be interested in). And randomizer races make an entertaining spectator sport due to their mix of skill and random elements.
