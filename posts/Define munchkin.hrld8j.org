This is about munchkin in the context of rational fiction.

- Define munchkin in your own words
- Is there a canonical definition besides [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin][tvtropes]]?


** Someone that abuses the technical content of the rules to violate the spirit of the rules.

Except the rules are the laws of physics (or whatever counts as physics in whatever world they find themselves in).

** A munchkin is someone who min-maxes for some aspect (usually power) in a way that others have not (usually due to the "spirit of the game").

Classically, the munchkin took the "short" disadvantage in exchange for an advantage (better eyesight?), with the assumption that the GM would not punish them for being short often, but that the advantage would be useful in combat situations, as a +1 to hit with a crossbow or something. The idea is to take penalties in exchange for benefits, but to have the penalties be something that does not come up often (generally for narrative reasons) and the benefit be in terms of combat.

If your penalty is you need to eat twice as much, but your GM thinks that keeping track of food and hunger is boring, then that "disadvantage" doesn't matter.

Even outside of such exchanges, you might build a character who gets lots of powerful abilities that can be used once per rest, taking advantage of the fact that your GM rarely attacks player characters in their sleep. This means that for every fight, all of your once-per-day powers are available, so they never run out, whereas the players with many-times-per-day powers just seem weak.

Outside of TTRPGs, it might be taking advantage of a quirk in the rules system. For instance, let's say we have a system with health, mana, stamina. Spells use mana, skills use stamina. Now, you take a perk that turns your mana into health, another perk that lets you turn stamina into health, and a perk that let's you cast spells/skills using health. Call it a bloodmage or something. Then you use a perk that doubles your health pool. Ordinarily, not that big a deal, but for you, that means 6x a normal health pool. Munchkins often try to stack multipliers.

As to "canonical", what does that mean in this context? There is not an "author" writing the English language and deciding the meaning of words. They mean what we think they mean. Within the game community, munchkin's definition is understood, but there isn't an authority who defines gaming terms

I see at least 3 definitions of Munchkin. In plain English it means "child or short person", then there is the game community one which you gave, and then there is the way it is used in this subreddit, e.g. in the "Saturday Munchkinry Thread". I was looking for the last one.

I would also say that Naruto in "The Waves Arisen" by Wertifloke ([[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/]]) is a munchkin.

*** re: what "canonical" means... in the online writing community, especially fanfiction and litrpg, "munchkin" is often used to refer to characters who are like the munchkin players you describe - sometimes, in the case of litrpgs, quite literally. Except the rules being exploited are those laid out, explicitly or implicitly, in the canon material (the original work), in the case of fanfic, or in the work itself, for original works.

Few things in fiction make me roll my eyes harder than authors inventing rules, specifically for their character to exploit, then writing smug dialogue where their character pats themselves on the back for being so brilliant as to immediately figure out the exploit that literally nobody else in the history of that world had ever thought of. Often they squeeze in some meta-self-pats by having the character talk about how well-thought-out the rules are before effortlessly exploiting the hell out of them. That said, munchkiny characters can be done well - many call Taylor in Worm a munchkin, because of the creative ways she leverages her bug powers.

*** Online, people saying "Define <foo>." are almost /always/ engaged in semantic quibbling rather than trying to actually poll people's opinions on what the term <foo> means. The (based on lots of experience with internet arguments) assumption was that the OP already had a very specific, rhetorically-useful-to-them definition in mind and was going to start a series of tedious arguments with any top level commenters who supplied a contrary definition. Possibly to try to shape the community's conception of <foo>, but also possibly to use [[/r/rational]] as an faux-authoritative source to win some outside argument by attributing the rhetorically-preferred definition to us.

That assumption didn't pan out, despite OP's unfortunate choice of title. Once it became clear that OP was not using this thread to drag people into tedious arguments over semantics and that there was going to be actually good content to be had (again despite the unfortunate title), the downvote train reversed and now this thread has modestly positive upvotes.

** Munchkinning as a verb has a more positive connotation than Munchkin as a noun.

People cite various origins for Munchkin. One of them is that it comes the 'munchkin', read as younger, players that joined the Tabletop Roleplaying hobby /after/ it had become such a big influence in videogames and brought with them a kind of feedback loop effect, applying videogame logic to the more narrative/social game, exploiting its more numerical systems. It's not the only origin but the idea is the same for all of them.

Munchkinning is now a looser, softer verb that refers to exploitation and optimization, but without the negative connotation of undermining the spirit of the game that munchkin would have, probably because it's not applied in those contexts any more (it has been replaced by powergaming and powergamer in the hobby's slang).

** Munchkin is the player that ignores story and roleplay for gameplay and mechanics.

I'm not sure if a character in a fictional world can be a munchkin, in my mind munchkinism is a meta property that means nothing in-universe.

If your character grinds dexterity and gold crafting candles 16h 7days a week for a year and then once he hits level 20 goes to kill the final boss - you're the munchkin, the character is just excentric :)

** A "munchkin" is someone who treats everything (or at least one thing they shouldn't by social convention) as an optimization problem.

​

Its roots in tabletop RPGs refer to players who apply that attitude to the game. Often resulting in things like the "commoner railgun" from D&D that clearly make no sense, but obey the rules as written, or characters who are specialized beyond plausible levels (usually for combat).

In fiction it will usually mean finding novel McGuiver-esque uses for some system in the fiction (magic, economics, etc.).

** As you've noticed there are a few different definitions. I think that most definitions involves an element of optimizing for something specific. Some of the negative versions of munchkin involve that the munchkiner is selfish and ruins the experience of others.

Wikipedia's definition of munchkin leads to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_%28role-playing_games%29][Powergaming]] which might give you an as canonical definition as you can get.

The result is a character who is excessively powerful in one particular way (or few chosen ways), but exceedingly weak in others (which are assumed non-essential).

*** This is basically one of the secondary subjects that was popular on 2011-2014 Lesswrong. I have a hard time telling how well that has worked out, having not moved to Silicon Valley to become a programmer living in a group house with a dozen roommates. Everyone who talks about it from the inside sounds like they really like it, even though from where I'm sitting, it sounds super awful.

So far as min-maxing is concerned, I think of things like meal replacement/optimization, extreme frugality and budgeting, optimizing for income, having a diverse investment portfolio consisting primarily of Vanguard and getting into Bitcoin early, nootropics, carefully picking the optimal workout routine, etc.

When I think about how I would min-max, if it didn't feel like it was way too late a long time ago (so, if I woke up tomorrow to find myself somewhere between 1990 and 2012)... I'd probably still be hamstrung by ADAHD and crippling anxiety, but assuming I actually had enough AP to somehow obtain an AP recovery ability... I'd probably try to focus on doing the SV programmer thing for the shortest timeframe possible, then when I can afford to retire to the Ozarks, do so. I don't do this now because ... ... ... ... hey, look, a bee!

(Also "eat right" and exercise. There is the category of sociality, but I haven't the faintest idea how to go about improving that, never mind optimizing. That's probably the only path toward useful AP boosts, which is probably why this never actually happens when I do something resembling try.)
