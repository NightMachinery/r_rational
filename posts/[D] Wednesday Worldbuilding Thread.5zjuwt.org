Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I was toying with the idea of a D&D game where the players were a band of bards who's performances caused magical effects (someone else already posted here about a magic system based around music, which I recommend if you can find it), and it grew from there to a way of reimagining D&D-style classes in a modern-tech setting who each draw power from a different source. The setting is vague but would have to be as adventure-friendly as D&D tends to be.

Bards are now celebrities who gain power from their fame and channel it through their artwork (why limit it to music?). Reproductions of their work don't have much (if any) power, which is why people obsess with getting original copies and even just autographs for a piece of real magic. The paparazzi are especially dangerous since they can leech power off of their subject by affecting their public image.

Clerics are geeks and fanboys whose power come from ritualistic "worship" of ideas more generic than traditional gods. A cleric based around music, for instance, doesn't necessarily see musicians as gods just figures in their mythology. The larger the fandom they're in, the more power there is out there, but the more they have to share it. For them, discussions about the meaning of art and abstract ideas are very serious since they can alter the rituals and power they grant.

Wizards ideally would be scientists and engineers, but since their magic is built around money businesses tend to have the most power even if they're technically only intermediaries. Spells originally consumed material components of recipes, but since money is a medium of exchange for materials it can be consumed just as easily. The only disadvantage over material components the cost changes based upon the value of the materials in the location being targeted.

Fighters are athletes who don't have any magic, but instead receive magical items that boost their abilities in the form of awards and sponsorships. Of all the classes, they are the only ones who are expected to go on heroic adventures. Sporting competitions are important, but there's still monsters to slay and damsels in distress. They've got the brute force to take on what no one else can.

These are all pretty abstract ideas probably more suited to a narrative game like Fate than D&D, but I still found them interesting. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to come up with cool ideas for all the classes. Druids could probably be New Agers and health nuts (or environmentalists who are reward by animal spirits if they're boring) while Barbarians are survivalists and conspiracy theorists, but I can't think of any way to make Rogues weirder than regular criminals.

*** Sounds like a cool idea. Basically extending the Pratchett esque idea that gods are fueled by belief into a modern celebrity context. You could add into the backstory that past culture heroes, kings, etc. were powered by that sort of belief. Same could apply to modern politicians etc as well.

In narrative terms you probably need to impose some costs and limitations on the power that fame can give you. Perhaps your fame empowers you only in ways that fit with your persona, e.g. the singer with the bad boy persona is empowered when doing reckless things, but not in other situations.And over time the persons original personality fades and is overwritten by the simplified archetype, which could be played for existential horror.

I'm less convinced by the latter ideas like wizards since they seem to be moving away from the core idea of the setting and trying to hammer in more generic fantasy classes. Sticking to the core idea and expanding on its implications is often more interesting.

*** I can't believe I missed this problem with wizard spells. Since money is only a medium of exchange, spells would have to transfer it rather than consume it in order for them to make any sense. I could just have it that the materials being "bought" have to be physically purchased from vendors in advance and put in a state where nearby wizards can draw on them, but I worry that is too thematically dissonant from the concept of money powered magic.

Then again, the concept is kind of absurd from an economic standpoint. If I had to do something else, then I'd just say mana is a natural resource that corporations gather and convert into a power source like gasoline and electricity that anyone can draw on if they can afford it. However, this lacks the feature of how spells change based on the local economy, which I thought was especially creative of me. I liked coming up with these zany ideas.

The only example I've even seen of a magic system based around money was the anime C: The Money and Soul of Possibility, which I do not recommend since it is about economics but the economy makes no sense.

**** How about: A ritual can make material components "available for purchase" at any price. Summoning these components can be done as part of spellcasting. A fraction of the summoned material is lost based on distance. (Plot hook: Unbeknownst to all, that fraction or part of it actually goes to the inventor of the ritual who built in a backdoor to that effect and then went on to market it as the only sane form of spellcasting) The user automatically summons from that source which costs him the least money.

***** That could work, though I would have it so that everyone knows about the "tax" because it's how spell writers collect licensing fees on their products. There is still a limited range so materials need to be physically transported over long distances, but that's what ties it into the local economy through domestic and imported goods.

*** I'd go a different direction and make barbarians drug abusers. Specifically things like PCP, steroids, and magical variants with more potent advantages and disadvantages. The survivalists and conspiracy theorists would suit rangers more, I think.

As for rogues, maybe make them hermits and hoarders? As in sort of bard-inverses, where their complete lack of human contact powers their ability to go undetected, glamour themselves, magically persuade people (diplomancer-style), and acquire hard-to-get things.

* Concept:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: concept
  :END:
It was almost the same story on every world. Once humans built farmlands and cities, they ruled the world. Not even the mighest and most powerful of beasts and monsters can challenge the might of their civilization. With the wilderness posing little threat, they turned to their attention to each other. They did many wonderful things in building their civilizations. Art, science, and philosophy flourished. There also however, negative impulses. They quarreled and warred against each other, commiting atrocities that only led to further revenge.

That was not to last on this world.

Nobody knew exactly when, but strange beasts powered by QI made their appearance from the West. At first those beasts only threatened the locals who were unforunate to live near them and the armed force that had to dispatch them. That was just the beginning. The Qi beasts also brought seeds, which then began to overtake the local ecosystem. This in turn, brought even more strange beasts to the land of the humans.

The invasive species also threatened the farmlands. The Qi creatures feasted on the crops, or more frequently, the new plants just overtook them. The cows, horses, sheeps, chickens, and other animals were not spared either.

Humanity fought back, but their knowledge and capability was outpaced by the new ecosystem growth. They couldn't adapt both to the threat posed by the Qi beasts or exploit opportunities posed by the new ecosystem.

Then, there were the quakes, which gradually became more frequent and more powerful over time. That was the last straw that broke the civilizations of old. The destruction of infrastructure led to a population crash, and scattering the rest.

--------------

Centuries passed, and humanity lived on. The reminder of human civilizations huddled together in heavily fortified settlements.

Still, the settlements couldn't provide everything humanity needed or wanted. There's still plenty of reasons to explore outside world, such as trading and obtaining rare resources which cannot be found in any settlements' farms or mines.

Enter the elite soldiers known as lanterns, who wield the power of qi better than any other in a combat environment. They are heavily specialized for movement and parkour, and their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters rather than hunting them, perfect for the environment and challenges they contend with on a day to day basis.

There are three classes of lanterns in this setting:

- *Scouts* - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers, such as useful plants or animals, or dangerous beasts who can threaten supply lines and routes.

- *Runners* - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements.

- *Heavy combat* - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

* Environment
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: environment
  :END:
Centuries of constant earthquakes shaped and broken the grounds until it became impossible for any wheeled transportation. Walking wouldn't fare much better in this environment. However, given the danger of the ground floor below, human begun to travel by branching and jumping through tree lines.

The wildlife were unsurprisingly, very dangerous, and very big, much like the trees which had grew very high and wide since the emergence of the Qi ecosystem.

Another dangerous force of nature to contend with are the fast moving waters at the bottom, which had became unpredictable and torrential. It carved cave systems and created further elevations, making the land even more unnavigable except for lanterns.

It is rare for lanterns to venture so far below, but there are dangerous water beasts lurking beneath the water.

* Resources:

Qi crystals are the lifeblood of settlement everywhere.

- *Light crystals*: Useful crystals of varying qualities that emit light. The best light crystals emit no heat, and only the wavelength needed to support plant growth. Those light crystals are the primary mean of growing food for colonies, or otherwise it would be impossible to practice agriculture. Certain colors of lights are better than others for growing plants.
- *Ice crystals*: Crystals that generate ice that usually come in a variety of cool colors. It can also be distinguished from other crystals by its coolness.
- *Fire crystals*: Crystals that generate heat that usually come in a variety of warm colors. It can also be distinguished from other crystals by its heat.
- *Tuner crystals*: Crystals that assists sigilmasters with creating sigils. It can be distinguished from other crystals by its thumming while held.

* Power and Abilities:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: power-and-abilities
  :END:
Every human beings born uses qi, and have roughly the same basic powers, though only a fraction of the population will be scouts and warriors.

- *Adhesion*: Using a basic qi technique, it is possible to stick to objects using bottoms of their feets and their palms. However, nothing can stick to the body elsewhere.

- *Enhanced Kinesthetic Sense*: Anybody could easily fall to their death if they made the wrong move, so it's important for people to be highly aware of their own bodies and what they are doing at all time.

- *Enhanced Upper Body Strength*: Since the world is three dimension, all four limbs must be used.

- *Sigilism*: A relatively undeveloped science. By drawing diagrams certain way and aligning tuner crystals in a three dimensional space, it's possible to create qi effects independent of a person.

- *Signs*: Any techniques casted by the user in the form of body motions and gestures to create effects. Although those motions were not strictly necessary, and could be omitted, it makes creating effects easier. Using a sign without making any gesture is an indicator of the mastery of that technique.

* Sigilism
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: sigilism
  :END:
The art of creating magic through the drawing of sigilism and its infusion by qi and tuner crystals.

- *Sigilmasters* - Scientists, engineers, and craftmen who study and practice sigilsim.

*Type of Sigils*:

- *Storage Sigil*- A standard sigil store objects in a pocket dimensions at the volume of one cubic meter with one-fifth the mass. This is what make lantern logistic and trade between colonies possible. However, since movement is life, carrying those storage sigils are an encumberance to the lanterns who carries them.

* Signs
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: signs
  :END:
Magic which are performed through equal part concentraction, motion and bodily gestures.

- *Elemental Ball* - Cast an elemental ball against an enemy, such as the classical fireball.
- *Boost jump* - The first sign that any lantern recruits learn and one that must be mastered before graduation.
- *Qi sense* - A very basic sign that can be powered by being continuously aware and alert. It is also enhanced by motion through the forest. It gives the qi user a partial 360 degree awareness of the world around them.

* Ranks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: ranks
  :END:
This is the Lantern Military Structure for all the villages.

Colors indicate skill levels and experiences. Chevrons indicate rank. The two systems usually go hand in hand with each other, though it was not always the case for various reasons.

- *Purple* - The elite and the very best.
- *Blue* - Veteran.
- *Red* - The basic grunt.
- *Green* - The rawest recruits who had just graduated from the academy.

* Colonies
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: colonies
  :END:
All humans live in colonies. Colonies, are self contained supporting environment, heavily fortified, more akin to acrologies than cities as we know it.

Colonies are usually underground and organized vertically into levels. The lowest level is the mine, followed by agriculture, the city, and finally, military installation.

*Mine:*

The mine is the most important level in any colonies, for it support agricultural production. Mainly, it contains access to qi well or veins, allowing the cultivation of light crystals vital to agriculture.

*Agriculture:*

The wilderness is extremely rich, supporting a density of biomass not found anywhere on Earth. It is therefore perfectly capable of supporting the human populations larger than any cities combined, but due to the amount of danger, this is not possible.

Agriculture in this context is having a safe place to farm, which are made possible by light crystals, freeing humanity from their dependence on sunlight.

*The City:*

The city levels are the beating heart of any colony, and also where everyone live irrespective of their position in society, from kings to miners.

Like any city, it is also where workshops and businesses are located.

One exception to this is any sigil workshops, which will be explained in the next section.

*Military Installation:*

Everything military-related are located here, including boot camps, obstacle courses, gyms, and so forth.

It is also where the sigil workshops are located, due to the nature of their work. Sigil infusion failures are known for their danger, thus it must be located away from the city below.

It is also the most ideal location to disembark from, as it is the highest level of any colony. Even in a three dimensional environment, the high ground is still an advantage.

*** From the last time I post this, I deleted pretty much almost all ninja inspired mythology by implementing Chinese? mythology.

The only thing left is adhesion, which only works on the soles and the palms and storage, which works more like a bag of holding than a pocket dimension.
