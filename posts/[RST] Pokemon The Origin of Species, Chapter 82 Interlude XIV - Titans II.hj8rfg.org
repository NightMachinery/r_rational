RIP Doctor, it was nice knowing you. I wonder if M2 can prevent the switch from triggering purely by mechanical telekinesis means? If it's a button or an actual switch, could it be held from being activated (as if jammed)?

Thank you for the amazing chapter as always! Every plot thread is so gripping I can't even decide which I'm looking forward to the most.

I'm not at all worried he's going to seek revenge to the point of disregarding collateral damage.

Having said that, I am extremely worried his Victory tulpa is going to go rogue since it seems to be a textbook dangerous daemon from AI horror stories.\\
Do I still want him to be free, because M2 is my favorite character and I'm way more invested in his happiness than any harm he will bring in-story? Absolutely.

****** Not looking too kindly on enslavers is miles away from eradicating the whole species, innocents included.\\
Most people are also not powerful telepaths, capable of feeling their victims emotions and thoughts as they “eradicate” them, so that would also push it further into “evil” territory.

Besides, he doesn't see pokemon as anything else than animals, and have himself used them for his own needs, even if they died as a result (when he was testing if he can make nearby pokemon dig towards the facility, they always died to the defenses, and he didn't feel particularly sorry).\\
So what Giovanni did to him is one thing, and “humanity as a whole should be eradicated” is quite another.

**** Well, I don't know. Team Rocket really hasn't put him through all that much grief, tbh. They've locked him away for 10 years, and they've distrusted him from the start, but none of their action have been positively cruel or unwarranted.

Dr. Light has already said that "Killing it might set this project back a decade" and that this event is an "opportunity". In that mindset, if M2 were to lay his cards on the table - to say that he knows about TR's betrayal and suspects their involvement in crippling him, and yet he is still explicitly going to try to stay on good terms with them - I'd give him a good shot of an amicable conclusion. Unless Dr. Light, even after hearing that, still decides to push the big red button, in which case TR's lives are forfeit and M2 will just go apeshit.

****** Well, if my kiddo, badly trained, might intelligently attempt to destroy humanity and had a good chance of succeeding, I might be a little understanding. The only reason the Endbringers of Worm and the Legendaries here do not immediately destroy humanity is because they are uncaring forces of nature. If Groudon, rather than getting anywhere near Kyogre, first headed straight inland to kill off humanity first, while Kyogre flooded in behind him, there would be zero counterplay - and everyone knows this, as background to growing M2.

How easily might M2 kill humanity, if he desired to do so?\\
- He can mind-control and mind-screw any pokemon within a seemingly immense radius, through solid objects, without notifying targets unless they are trained psychics.\\
- He can shield his mind perfectly from mind-reading.\\
- He has a psychic blast strong enough to kill a kangaskhan.\\
- He is intelligent enough to prepare himself adequately before striking and ally himself with friendly trainers.\\
- He can Recover his telomeres to prevent aging and Recover his brain to prevent decay due to buildup of plaque. None of the other legendaries seem to have an age limit, so why should he?

As in the movie, he might capture pokemon himself and become an immensely strong psychic trainer, which he might use as a stepping stone to capturing weaker legendaries. The thought of a free M2, with a team of legends, arbitrarily deciding to destroy humanity, must weigh heavily on TR.

Should he be unable to kill a legend on his own (which would be a stretch given his anime and in-game appearances, but might be the case here for narrative purposes), he might simply leave for some rock across the sea, get an internet connection, and do research on the governmental structures of the various in-universe countries. What could an intelligent being with arbitrarily strong psychic powers do to a wholly unsuspecting world leader? What secrets might M2 extract from trainers' minds?

Yes, I can definitely understand TR's perspective here.

*** Live the continues development on the Legendaries.

So based on the comments, the Titans roam around Sinnoh already? I am curious how that would effect things as their lack of pressure is less likely to cause a Tier 3 event, but being unstoppable forces means they cant be directed away from a city that they can just walk through.

Have you had any thoughts on Sinnoh in general? Such as the roaming legendary birds from Platinum? I imagine the Lake Spirits and the big 3 are largely inactive on modern Sinnoh society, but beyond them and the other trios there is still Heatran, Shaymin, Cresselia, and Darkrai.

Plus the Battle Frontier in concept of this world intrigues me.

** I think this is the part of the story that signals the end of the second act and the beginning of the third. Stakes are raised, major pacing changes, villains playing their final trap cards... I'm excited. Everything's coming to a head. Mega evolutions being uncovered at the same time as Team Rocket, Titans and Rayquaza being uncovered at the same time, the Latios duo entering the frey, and of course, Mewtwo's finally going to get his due. I don't believe Kyogre actually died here, I have a feeling Daystar will make that more dramatic when it happens. As the pokemon power levels begin to get ridiculous, the humans are going to get left behind by a lot. Megas and the Latios will help somewhat, but its already been established that these legendaries completely sweep through armies of the world's best trainers, and many of the legendaries coming out now are implied to be even stronger. I'm a little worried about the Giovanni plotline here. He was built up to be a capable and prepared villain, but now he's both lost his gamble with the Hoenn myths and lost his prized possession. And its going to be hard for him to be a threat when you have multiple unbeatable legendaries around. Which brings me to my last point - How do we fit this big shift in story with the all the bits that came before it? If its a struggle for even Giovanni to maintain any sort of threat power, its going to be very hard for me to believe our protagonists being able to do anything. Blue is the only with with decent combat abilities and he's not even half way through his badges. Blue's whole motivation is becoming a strong enough trainer to kill a god, and right now he could barely handle a couple of renegades. And that's because the main characters don't feel anywhere near the end of their storyline, which is weird considering these sorts of catastrophes usually indicate you're nearing the end of the story. Or maybe that's not correct and this Hoenn thing is going to be resolved and everything is going to progress from there. It's going to be really hard to increase the power level from Groudon and Kyogre.. unless maybe Lugia becomes a thing? You do have almost 20 chapters to wrap it up (assuming you're going for the clean 100). On the otherhand, I do like the aprubtness of this random event. I don't know if you timed these chapters this way on purpose, but it feels very fitting right now that world wide disasters don't give a shit where you are in your "plotline".

Also am patiently waiting to see mewtwo fuck some people up. I don't think I should be rooting for him but I kind of am anyway

*** I dont think this is the end of act 2. To me it seems like the start of it. To me act 1 ended with Vermillion. This has been them apart before coming together. We still have 4 more gyms. Saffron is kind of covered, but there is still Fuscia and Cinnabar to at least visit. Of course HPMOR really threw a cork screw arouns this point, so who knows.

The Rocket Casino getting exposed doesnt necessary end Giovanni. His greatest strength is his organizations resources.

Plus Mewtwo escaping doesnt suddenly expose him. He will likely go into hiding for a while, potentially by Cerulrean while the Renegades attempt to track him, creating a backdrop for the upcoming story since this will lead to increased activity with most not knowing why.

What with the possibly-fatal fall, I'd think Red's first action if he stayed alive and conscious (and checked Blue and Leaf was alright) would be to check everyone in range to gauge the number of survivors. So feeling something as weird as relief then death (as opposed to shock/horror/resignation then death, or straight-up unexpected death, from being crushed by building materials) might have outed Ramin already, even if he's Dark.

Of course, with Ramin planning to continue killing, he's pretty much guaranteed to be outed by Red eventually if he keeps up his psydar for any appreciable length of time.

  Even if [the magnetons/magnezones] don't draw the ire of the sea god, their magnetic levitation is hard to sustain for long, and he has no way to recover them once they sink underwater.

Surge really could've used a couple of balloons there, if not to keep his pokemon levitating then at least to keep them near the water's surface once they drop and help spot them easier from above water.

  Latis
#+end_quote

I was thinking about the timeline of the battle against Kyogre. Birch said Brendan and May were traveling at the speed of a jet (plane), and assuming that the speed of sound is about 340 m/s (pulled off of Wikipedia, assuming dry air at sea level and constant temperature 15 degrees Celsius), even a Mach 0.5 would be 170 m/s or 612 km/h. The fact that they were over the sea suggests they came from Southern Island, the latis' in-game home, so if Hoenn scales to Kyushu (and with a bit of fingertip-approximating the distance scale bar on Google Maps) that'd put the distance between the island and Sootopolis at 200 km at max? (Steven reached Groudon and Kyogre after teleporting to Sootopolis and flying a few minutes. Presumably the coast of Sootopolis is also where Groudon walked off from?) As a rough estimate, that'd mean it took Brendan and May twenty minutes at most, and probably less, from when Birch was watching TV and calling reinforcements to reach the clash, assuming they didn't need to do something else on their way.

So it took most of the other (lower-case) elite trainers less than twenty minutes to drop whatever they were doing, teleport to presumably Sootopolis (or maybe somewhere to the east of Route 122, since people seemed to have different teleport points), and then fly in to join the battle. These people work fast. Guess it's to be expected in a world where Pokemon can make things go to hell at the drop of a hat though.

Also, Surge probably should have told Brendan and May about his magneton/magnezones that he left as area controls. Assuming that the two are also attacking Kyogre while it's out of range of the landlocked pokemon, they might accidentally get too close to Surge's pokemon and run afoul of the "attack any pokemon that approach" command.

  and [Wallace] fights the urge to pull out his phone to take a picture.
#+end_quote

I feel like he should've taken it anyway. Documentation being the difference between science and playing around, and all that. I think it would've helped corroborate whatever outlandish story he would've had to tell later, which he probably would have to tell if he intends to take the blame for unleashing the Titans.

  Someone once set a recording device at some ruins for days until they captured enough samples to turn into a haunting song of sorts (someone else then took the sounds and applied enough autotuning to actually make pretty catchy club music).

  everything about the unowns
#+end_quote

Now that opens up a whole can of interesting worms.

Firstly on just how language developed on the Japan-based regions, since unown letters presumably far predated the warring states era where Japanese was the official language before giving way back to (spoken) Unown (though the games' dexes have also raised a similar question). Secondly on people of that far earlier era apparently knowing enough about this power of the unowns to write it down, presumably using it for themselves, and why that's no longer the case. Were the trapped Regis the result of something natural, or something intentional? And if the latter, something human, or something non-human? (This is me bringing up the question of the motivation behind the Storm Birds' attacks all over again...) And lastly, is the Regis already being free in Sinnoh an indication something similar happened there in the past? Like, say, an attempt to quell one or more of the Creation trio, or perhaps even the big G (big A?) himself.

#+begin_quote
  "No, Doctor, I am quite well. I believe I'll take a walk."

Now that was a smoothly made request, that played on sentimentality and might just open up a sure path to escape, as Dr. Light realizes in her thoughts following this. All those years of yearning for freedom, and this might be it.

** Just caught up with this story, first time commenting.

If people from other regions are about to catch their legendaries, that sure puts a lot more pressure on the Kanto people to catch theirs, too. It's a good thing people from Kanto are participating in the fight against Hoenn's, but will that incentivize the Hoenn people to not ask for/allow help with new titans? Just because Maxi blew it with Groudon doesn't mean a real champion would fail with a Regithing.

It amused me to imagine how obvious Dr. Light was grabbing the remote.

I predict that the Rocket Casino's new pokemon is a rotom in a broken coffee machine. But he's sleeping. He sleeps a lot, which is why it just looks like a normal broken coffee machine. The clogged, soggy grounds are what make it a ground-type. Thanks for playing.

Not entirely sure, but I think this was meant to be "never /close/ enough to risk touching each other"? And the opposite would've been phrased more naturally as "close enough to risk touching each other"...I think.

"wasn't" -> "weren't", technically. Apparently that's the more correct conjugation of "be" for any past hypothetical/subjunctive form, though using "wasn't" for first-person past subjunctive occurs commonly enough.

Also in chapter 14 Leaf's joke on Red's "unknown unknowns" comment was "What, you think there's more than 28"? Which probably should be 26 with the revelations of this chapter. (She's going to be so surprised she's right though, assuming the fact comes out.)
