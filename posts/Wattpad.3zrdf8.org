What is the opinion on this subreddit on Wattpad?

Obviously many of you write fan fiction, but I don't remember anyone ever linking to a piece on there. Is there a reason why it is not used more regularly by this group?

(Full transparency: I am currently looking for a new job and a friend has a lead on a role in the organization. Before I speak to anyone there I'd like to understand how actual 'generators' feel about the website).

Thanks!

Edit: Thanks everyone. Really appreciate your comments. Spoke with an ex-employee today and she was able to give a lot of context in why they set up their site the way they did. Your comments were great for giving me question fodder.

*** The login form blocking use was my first complaint too. Imagine if YouTube required you to login before you could see a video? Seems like a bad idea.

They have a user base though. They get 2mm unique visitors a month and about 40mm views - so lots of people and a high engagement rate...

**** Isn't a high percentage of that people googling assignment solutions and that kind of thing? Wattpad isn't only a fiction website. You'd have to know which people go there for the fiction.

** I am primarily a reader, and write rarely.

The UI looks pretty good, though the focus on images rather than descriptions for the list of fanfictions is a bit unnerving. I prefer descriptions to book covers, but some may prefer that. The site itself is reasonably pretty.

I found a fanfiction that looked interesting, clicked on it, and was required to log in to read it. Seeing this, I closed the window.

*** Seriously, how am I supposed to decide to read something with no more information than "HP AU." Why do so few people seem to include descriptions?

**** Discovery writers, creating a new "story" object on a site before the first chapter is yet written, have very little idea what they will end up writing about.

Once they /have/ written it and know, it doesn't occur to them to go back and update the metadata.

One of my favorite thing about adaptations, remasterings, etc. is that they already have all the content of the original available, so they can create really rich and lovely metadata: cover art that actually reflects the imbued themes of the text rather than the theme intended at the beginning; quotes from evenly-spaced sections within the story, rather than all clumped together from an introductory segment; etc.

Which is all to say: if you're writing a serial, sometimes it's best to write the first five-or-so chapters entirely offline, and only /then/ make a site, slap those all up on it, and begin with periodic updating thereafter. After five chapters, you'll have enough down on paper to know what the story---and thus the site---are actually "about."

** I tried it out a few months back. The very first thing I noticed was that the site expects you to actually write the story using the site, and has no way to import pre-written stuff. Or if it has, it's sufficiently non-intuitive that I had been unable to figure it out in the short time I spent messing around with it. Copy-pasting things causes text to lose all formatting.

I pretty much gave up on the site after that. I will admit I was already a little suspicious due to never having seen a link to the site on any of the story recommendation sources I usually use, so I didn't try very hard. I just took a quick look and made a snap judgement.

** Forced login is a bummer. If I'm posting stuff I wrote online, I want it to be as highly read as possible, which means getting the barriers as low as possible.

Wattpad is aimed at a slightly different market than ff.net and AO3; it's geared for heavy serialization and community interaction. ff.net does a piss-poor job at most things, but interactions with fans is a particular low point. I've only posted a few stories to AO3 in the past, but it's only a little bit better (and still obviously a labor of love). I find the interface for Wattpad to be better for most things, but that's partly because I like a clean, sleek, modern look.

I personally think heavy serialization in shorter chunks combined with heavy author/user interaction is likely to be the way of the future for web fiction, but I don't particularly like user interaction^{*} and I like my chunks to be large, so I'm probably not in the right demographic as a creator. As a reader, I prefer bingeing my way through long works instead of reading them spread out in drips and drabs, so I'm probably not their target demo there either.

* I love reading reactions and speculation, I like being able to get corrections and sometimes offer clarifications, but most of the time I want a work to speak for itself without me waggling my eyebrows or pulling back the curtain to show how the set was made.

*** To me, it's another site to post on, which is great. But it's also yet another site to post on, which is a chore.

If you want to max exposure, you would post on all the sites, except FF which is only for fanfics.

But at the same time, it's more work, unless it's automated by software tools.

** If someone were to post a link to that site, I'd probably downvote the post and suggest the user post a link that doesn't require login. If it sounded interesting I may even try and google for it on a different site, then I'd make up some login info with a throwaway address and not bother remembering the password.

The search feature is practically unusable. From what I can tell it must search the entire story instead of the title and description. While this is an excellent feature to have, it is a horrible feature to force. Even if there's a way to use syntax to limit it, it shouldn't be the default.

** Can't speak for anything but fanfiction, things might be different for other genres.

FF and AO3 have found their own definite niches. I just can't see Wattpad having the same draw, especially as its competition allows anyone to read and review anonymously. From a quick comparison of readership stats between popular fics on all three sites, this seems accurate.

Strangely, despite Wattpad's integration of social media features, it doesn't seem like there's as much audience feedback as on FF. Take all this with a grain of salt, though; I just eyeballed the numbers.
