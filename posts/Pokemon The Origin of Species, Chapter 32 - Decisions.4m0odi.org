** "Red didn't mean to imply with his comments that Yuuta wasn't a Renegade. He was just reacting automatically to potential bias or irrationality. Blue has accused him in the past of getting too much enjoyment out of being a devil's advocate to infuriating extremes, but Red never means to do it maliciously. Something in him just naturally pushes back at things that look too sure or damning."

This is something that I sympathize greatly with. It's an issue I often have, too. Regardless, this was a fantastic chapter. I really felt the tension Red felt in my gut when he made his decision.

** Hey all, welcome back! A few quick notes: first, my website is up! Thanks to my patrons and their continued support, you can head over to [[http://daystareld.com][daystareld.com]] to find the whole story uploaded there, including a FAQ page, an updated team roster, and a Disqus comment system. I've also uploaded some other things there, including writing/tabletop RPG advice and some board game reviews. Hopefully I'll be able to continue adding more work soon: any and all feedback on the site design, articles, or comment system are welcome!

Second, this chapter includes the first bit of poetry I've written in years. Feedback on it would be particularly welcome, including any suggestions to improve lines or sections: I don't plan on doing much more poetry writing anytime soon, but since I'm so out of practice with it I feel the least confident in its quality.

And third, if you're looking for new rational fiction to read, I recently finally started Unsong, and am devouring it as fast as I can. Without going into spoilers, imagine if the God of the Old Testament was real, and speaking parts of his True Name (in Hebrew of course) let you cast magic spells. Then imagine corporations patented parts of the Name to monopolize their use, and were resisted by an underground coalition of Unitarian Universalist communist kabbalists. Then imagine the whole thing was written like a cross between Douglas Adams and Good Omens.

It's pretty fantastic, is what I mean to say. Head over to [[http://unsongbook.com/][unsongbook.com]] to check it out, and thanks for reading, as always!

** So, few things. First the renegade system seems a little more abusable than it should. In general I find it interesting, but they should have to sign something, or officiate their stance in some way. As of now I cannot decide wether this is a comment on the story, or on the world.which in general means you're doing a good job of writing it. I would be afraid that a ranger would just say "yes, they witnessed and went on their way"

When spoken out loud "I'd teach you and you'd teach me" Sounds worse than "I taught you and you taught me" with the same general flow to the poem, but I am in no way a poet, so keep a few grains of salt on hand.

I was finding that line a little flow-breaking, and going from "I'd" to "I" and "you'd" to "you" definitely helps; just slightly shortens those syllables. Occurs to me that "I teach you and you teach me" would also fit, but maybe that would be a little too much of a direct quote.

Finding myself /slightly/ tripping over "Our nights" too, but that may be an issue of accent/pronunciation with "Our" being more elongated in a British accent (more like "oww-er", rather than just "are")

**** Shin Sekai Yori is really good if you like psychological horror and fantasy. Has that creepy vibe the entire time of "Something is very VERY wrong but I don't know exactly what it is." I'd put it in the top 5 horror anime series I've watched. That said, it's not really "rationalist." Just good horror.

Do yourself a favor though and ignore the manga. It's much more about fan service than story building. Which, well, I guess can be good in its own way... but doesn't hold a candle to the anime.

** Great chapter! Reread 31 again right before it, and man, what gut punches. I feel for Red, but honestly I think I took the deaths harder than he did, and felt more like Blue when it came to witnessing for Yuuta.

Something I might have just missed or misunderstood - is Branding a physical brand? It doesn't sound like it, as it's implied that Yuuta is to be executed and not simply marked, but I was wondering if the Brand is actually something more solid than just a Kill-on-sight order.

No, self defense is allowed, which is why Yuuta pointed out that Maturin attacked his abra, trying to justifyung him summoning sandslash and attacking with it.

** The Renegade handling makes the judiciary system in /Ace Attorney/ seem fair and procedurally sound.

More seriously, as I said in a comment to the previous chapter, I think it's a bit inconsistent that at the same time there are "Pokemon lives matter" activists, and they also execute people without anything resembling a fair trial for "reckless Pokemon handling with malicious intent". That's not the level of America's stereotypical "being tough on crime" (years in prison for weed), that's the the level of trials at the dawn of the Soviet Union where they "disposed of the archaic capitalist notion of 'guilt'" (replacing it with the notion of "danger for society"). I think the story is going in the direction of lampshading the flawed system (unlike, e.g. /Harry Potter/ were in a supposedly "wonderful" world the judiciary system is fucked beyond belief, and not a word is said against the system as a whole), but maybe it's starting too "dark", at this point of the world's progress there should've been some reforms already.

In the sense that if society progressed to the level that a significant number of people start caring about animal rights, a significant number of people (possibly, not the same people, but there should be an overlap) should already care about human rights and not be okay with summary executions. The chapter almost makes Leaf look like those radical eco-terrorists: she's pretty vehement about Pokemon abuse, but she's kinda just a bit queasy about summary execution of a human.

This is happening "out of sight, out of mind" to "evil foreigners". If it was the case that you could be executed as a terrorist by a police officer and four random people basically on the spot without even right for attorney or /habeas corpus/, there would be more outrage.

So in the end I understand that it won't happen (and I don't begrudge you for that, it's a minor point), because it would require a major restructuring of a story, and also I'm just one person, but I think what would work better if there were separate Pokemon courts that tried trainers with a simplified procedure, but still adhered to standards of courts-martial, or at least courts from /Ace Attorney/.

The perspective of Renegades in culture has a lot to do with this: it's drilled into everyone's head from an early age that these are the lowest of the low: in a world where monsters threaten humanity daily, a human choosing to use monsters to kill others is an unforgivable act. Human rights are for those that do not prove themselves inhuman.

Most Renegades are branded out of sight as well other than by those who are their potential victims, like Blue and Leaf, and who are not usually the kind of people particularly interested in giving the Renegades the benefit of the doubt. The idea that people deserve all these safeguards our society has in place for preserving innocence are basically tossed on their head for Renegades: if an accused murderer goes free, maybe they'll murder a few more people before they're caught again. Renegades command creatures that can wipe out entire towns, when directed with human intelligence.

The legalized lynch mob is kind of an important point in the structure of society though :) I don't want their government and society to be too perfect or progressive in every field: I think living under constant siege would cause certain aspects of society to be more draconian than less, and how they treat "treason," which is what being a Renegade in such a tight-knit, everyone-helps-each-other kind of society is akin to, is one of those areas.

** Red seems confused real Renegade aren't as blatantly odd and different to the average person as media has portrayed them. Amusing, and yet it makes sense such a hated and feared profession would be exaggurated by people.

Seems everyone's pretty tense after the Renegade judgement is passed too, and Red's pretty sore about the loss of two of his pokemon. Snapping at Blue due to something he thought was implied condensation when instead it was concern, after all...

Unsurprised that Red's more bothered about the dead humans than his Rattata. He knew the scientist less time-wise, but they were also the same species as him, and thus he's hardwired to care for them more. I think.

Checked the names on a whim, and realized the second's referencing a town from Pokemon Colosseum and XD. Those games and the region they take place in canon to this story, then? The first's an anime-exclusive kanto town, but I'm unsurprised you borrowed that considered the sheer unlikelihood of only having the number of towns and cities in the games populating Kanto.

Good explanation for the heroes obtaining fossils akin to the game progression, and I like how all three got to pick one of the canon pair. And in the case of Leaf, one you would normally obtain from a scientist at Pewter Museum.
