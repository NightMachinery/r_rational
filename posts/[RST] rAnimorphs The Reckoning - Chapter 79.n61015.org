  Work has been busy, as has life (I got engaged!!!), hence the three-day delay. I will still try my best to get the next update out by May 16 (i.e. eleven days from now), but I may again need an additional few days. It will be absolutely no later than Sunday, May 23 (and if there are any late edits to this chapter, they'll go up then, too).

[[/u/TK17Studios]] I vote that you edit this to make the 23rd your default and the 30th your last resort fallback, getting engaged is a big deal. Chapter 78 was spectacular and earned you a lot of reader trust, so you can definitely afford to delay, and you deserve a nice break.

*** I need to reread Livingston's section. What I tookaway is that morphing will draw Crayak's attention, because he's assuming that the Animorphs were poofed away, and also that Eddris is up to something but being secretive because Marco knowing the details means that Crayak know's the details.

I feel kinda dumb for underestimating Eddris as a resource. She's apparently gotten to play with the still-enigmatic Time +Matrix+ Lattus, and her story contains plot holes and contradictions which are being played off as the doing of C/E/T. I don't think this is the key to solving the problem, for meta reasons, but ugh Ellimist put in effort to bring Eddris into things, here; why /didn't/ I pay more attention to Eddris?

His predictable Georg-Elser style of rationality combined with him having no idea what he's doing (or if there even is something he can think of doing, where he is), maximizes the computation cost to figure out whether to call the bluff and not intervene [at the risk of him blowing something up] or to fold and kill him [at the risk of there not being anything that he could have blown up].

** Oh my, what a chapter! Thank you so much TK17Studios.

Is Cassie's plan to aggro Crayak and die, or does she really want to xenocide 2*10^{9} hyperviolent babies?

(I'm guessing the answer is 'yes')

It feels like it kinda makes sense in a weird way, but also what? Could someone please put into words why the previous desperation-fueled xenocide looked like a bad idea to her, and this one does not?

Obviously a lot of things changed between the two answers, but I fail to model her thought process and locate the tipping point.

*** My read: Previously, her decision not to xenocide was directly influenced by Toomin, or rather assumed by Toomin and used to effectuate Toomin's final gambit to ascend the Chee. Now, having passed that phase of the plan and having used it to accrue brownie points for Rachel, there is less benefit to be had from keeping the Chee alive. Like, Cassie has just been told, "Your decision was explicitly suboptimal, and I just used your suboptimal decision-making to fool a God-being." If you've been told that your thought processes are so idiotic that God himself can't account for them, you're apt to reevaluate your life.

*** It's because the stakes are raised way higher now. The Animorphs have one chance to act, and that's it. They either win, or Crayak kills them all and then goes back to eating galaxies starting with Earth as the epicenter. None of Cassie's or Elfangor's arguments about de-escalation and not crossing lines really apply in the face of that ultimatum.

So they need to pull on any and all levers that are available to them, and attempting to QV the Howlers is one of the biggest ones they've got.

Which makes me wonder ... when you're put in a situation like this, is Pascal's Mugging a remotely applicable concept? It's like a trolly problem whose stakes have gotten so enormous that normal huristics fall apart.

** Great chapter. Short, doesn't really blow my mind too much, but you're putting the final pieces in place. Can't wait to see what the other plans are.

BTW, this isn't rational fiction but I found a podcast/ARG related to Animorphs called "Sporadic Phantoms" (it's an anagram). It's about three investigatory podcasters trying to figure out what The Sharing is...takes place in the modern day, and the three hosts do not have /any/ idea anything about yeerks, andalites, morphing, etc, so it's all from an outsider's perspective. IT's very well made for something that I can't imagine more than like 60 people listen to.

Sorry to promote something else here, but this rational fanfic and that podcast are like the two greatest pieces of animorphs non-canon content made, and they're being made simultaneously, which is pretty cool. I love finding these treasures on the internet.

Are there any other pieces of rational fiction that are as good as The Reckoning that I can read after this story is finished? I'm really going to fucking miss this story. It's been a wild ride.

** Really though, /fuck/ being in Leeran hypersight.

I mean yeah, if the stakes are this high do it obviously, but argh it would suck so much and I completely get where Cassie is coming from. Knowing about the spotlight effect doesn't help, and people making soothing noises that you know beyond doubt are genuine just makes things worse. Love this segment so much.

In a fandom that regularly uses Cassie as a punching bag, I've always appreciated that this story depicts Cassie trying to be good as something hard and confusing instead of childish and stupid.

And Cassie changing her mind like that once she has to also mirrors canon, because /of course/ it does. In 43, when the group has a plan to blow up the Yeerk Pool, Cassie bows out. Then in 52 when they're past status quo and shit is really hitting the fan, she still thinks that it's just as wrong but goes along with it anyway.

--------------

Anyway, I want to talk about something more important, /Ko/.

+We don't have the full rules so maybe I'm misunderstanding the game, but moving sideways isn't about denying the block, it's setting up for the next move.+

+As someone who has thought about this game for ten whole minutes, my opening move as attacker is moving sideways, and I would not have expected the standard meta to be charging down the middle and hoping the defender doesn't play directly in front of the pawn (6-4). Moving forward as attacker seems like a meme opening, or if you're playing the same people regularly you do it just enough to force your opponent to play 6-4 against you just in case.+

+Is Helium just a /Ko/ snob?+

+This meta reeks of Ellimist/Crayak meddling-+

Blargh, nevermind. The board resets after every round, doesn't it? Yeah that makes much more sense and clears up the confusion I had about the rules and Helium's commentary.

Yeah I like the first round, even if it should be effectively meaningless and I'm playing X-4 as defender / move forward as attacker every time in a serious game.

I normally can't stand simultanious action board games. Someone eating my lunch with a move is fine, but having to watch the rest of my now worthless move play out without being able to change tactics sets my teeth on edge. But weirdly I don't think that would bother me with /Ko/, since that's the entire point of the game to begin with.

What's the victory condition for the defender? Holding off the attacker for X number of rounds? Or does a match have both players play take turns as each position, and the better attacker wins?

Speaking of victory conditions. The Ellimist's win condition has always been pretty vague, even in canon. It seems like the Animorphs are overestimating how much Crayak cares about certain things. Presumably all Crayak has to do is stop them from winning and run the clock out; the Howlers seem like something he doesn't need anymore.

Even if part of the plan is blowing up the exposed part of the hypercomputer, that may be annoying to Crayak but still secondary to stopping whatever the Animorphs are going to try to do to win the game.

So, okay, if the win condition is something along the lines of harmony between Yeerks, humans, and Andalites living on Earth... could you just kill every human and Howler on Earth, then send an infested Tobias and Helium to Earth and call it a day? That might be too dangerous to try though, killing /almost/ every human seems like an easy way for Crayak finish the job. Then again, maybe there just aren't any good options to begin with so take what you can get?

And bringing it back full circle, why is /Cassie/ the one going on the genocide mission? Helium even says that they were able to send people on missions suited to them, and Cassie is, well, maybe not literally the last person I would send but she doesn't make the shortlist.

#+begin_quote
  I can do this. I can get to Mars, and pull the trigger, if Crayak doesn't stop me.

  And then---at that point---

  I would already /be/ on Mars.

  Once more, understanding flowed outward, spreading throughout the circle, followed by acceptance, acknowledgement, agreement.
#+end_quote

This seems extremely relevant, but I've spent some time thinking about it and can't figure out why. Cassie is going to Mars to genocide the Howlers, but that's only step one. She has something else to do there, something that will help against Crayak and be particularly suited to her and has to be on Mars paritcularly... yeah, I don't see it.

The other time when Mars comes up in this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  /There's also---uh---/

  It was very hard to not-think-something on purpose in Leeran hypersight.

  /---life, on Mars, these days./
#+end_quote

I had read this as not wanting to bring up the pure ick that is the human colony, but did Helium /succeed/ in not thinking about something, and pivoted to the humans still on Mars? After a quick ctrl-f of the story, the only thing on Mars should be the Mars base which has the bio lab, the automanufactory, the cache of earth military tech, the holochamber with the Howler morph in it, the ships and humans that were assaulting the base, and the human colony (along with Cassie's parents).

I do think the Howler genocide is a screen for a bigger play Cassie is going to make, but I don't see what it would be.

  /If you're playing Magic or---or blackjack or something, I don't know---if there's no way to win/ unless /you draw a specific card in the next three turns or whatever---/

  The parts of us that were Aximili and Elfangor had nodded in recognition of a core military principle.  It made no difference whether the odds of drawing that specific card were one in three, or one in three thousand---if it were genuinely the case that /all/ of one's hopes of victory hinged upon it, then one should behave as if one were /guaranteed/ to draw it, and take only those actions which were optimal in that swath of possibility.

Hmm... came up with that one myself. Not sure where I needed it. Some turn-based card game I think. Also use that as a general life-strategy.\\
[justifying high risks, because I'm not terrribly interested in the futures, where I don't win all the things]\\
Does it have a name?\\
Seems somewhat related to convex vs concave dispositions, except it's something different:\\

** Wait isn't Livingstone /already/ in z space?

  I was caught like a fly in honey in the middle of the Z-space rift---had been traveling across it at a snail's pace for days

If Livingstone is already in z space, new coordinates should just change his direction but he'll still be stuck in the rift, right?

Maybe just have him already across the rift at this point in the story? But then again my impression is that the rift takes months to traverse (or does it? Someone look up the reference), so there's no way he'd be able to have crossed it already...

*** Oh, yeah, I should tweak this a bit, thanks.

Basically, he's either going left in Z-space and should change course midstream to right, or if we want to pretend like there's no problem with what I wrote, he dropped out of Z-space to calculate a new jump.

(You can drop out of Z-space into normal space even in the middle of the rift.)

But yes, he would still just be not-even-in-the-middle-of-it, still subject to its effect. Wonder what's up with THAT, hmmmm?

** Congrats on your engagement, TK! That's huge :)

Another pretty abstract chapter. A lot of /talking about plans/, and /talking about talking about plans/, and /thinking about plans that are being talked about offscreen/. I think maybe I was hoping for something a little more concrete, narrative-wise, after the last one was such a major domino setup chapter - like, I'm probably just fiending to get into the really meaty fight-against-Crayak stuff. But this is fine too! Now I get to look forward to the next one.

Plus, like, it's hard to imagine I'll ever be /disappointed/ in a chapter of r!Animorphs. Everything here was great.

Livingstone's quiet, reflective sort of march to the grave was very somber and cool.

I REALLY liked Helium's /ko/ stuff - everything felt so natural, and the gameplay interactions Helium described were such logical developments of the ruleset presented. It felt like the author was casting around for some sort of metaphor for the situation with Crayak, some sort of streamlined translation into intuitively relatable game theory, and realized he could just make up a game that elegantly hits all the major points ("We move at the same time without knowing what the other guy's doing") instead of trying to force a comparison to chess or go or whatever. I vote someone fleshes it out - establishes the new types of walls and pawn moves per round, figures out a first-to-X-rounds win condition or something - and makes it into a real game. :P

Aaaand Cassie's freakin' out again. Poor thing. She's such an interesting character - she's like two or three (or ten?) people crammed into one head, fighting and jeering and sniping at each other. It was a little difficult for me to empathize with the internal conflict when it was all trotted out under hypersight, I think. (That Leeran must know so much tea by now. What's his story? Who is he? Why is he never in the mindmelds? I smell a spinoff fanfic.) I mean, with Cassie's fractured nature laid bare for everyone to look at, you'd think the others would see her and feel the way she operates, and it almost feels like they /couldn't/ do anything but accept her for it. And then you'd think she would feel their acceptance and feel a little better about herself.

It feels like the others would see her good ideas, and then they'd see her sneakily start second-guessing herself, and they'd think, "Well this second voice is obviously useless, let's just ignore it and go with the obviously good first voice." And Cassie would see how genuinely the others appreciate her ideas, and she'd be more able to discount the sneaky second-guesser voice.

I think this happens a little bit in the chapter, but she panics too quickly for it to take hold and be a good thing. I'm also confused as to how she had... time, maybe? ...to come up with that whole shower argument with fake Marco and fake Jake, when she was watching them not-have those reactions right in front of her.

I know that's all a confused jumble, but I have to eat dinner, not proofread.

Great chapter! Eager for more!

/I've been hoping someone would talk about ko./ Actually, this is a preexisting game that I've been tinkering with for the past few years, and it occurred to me as I was wrestling with the chapter that I could make it an Andalite thing. =)

** So I'm commenting on this blindly without having read the chapter or other comments:

I haven't left feedback on the last few chapters because recent events in my personal life have made the r!Animorphs subject matter unusually triggering to me, and I just had to put it down for a while. I'm nearly at a place where I can start reading it again, and I'm really excited to finish it, but I just wanted you, TK17, to know that I'm still a big fan of this work.

** I'm lonely and sad so I'm going to type a bunch of thoughts and hopefully they won't come across as unorganized.

I feel like this last act of Reckoning has gotten somewhat bogged down. I'm going to write it straight in the thesis because the rest of this comment is brushing back towards the positive.

Even as far back as the post-Jake chapter after the Arn mission, I was feeling a certain sense of the plot losing the characters. In early adventures the rationalizing the characters did dovetailed with their personal arcs and felt grounded, like what a literate young high schooler would work through in a given situation. As the Ellimist and Crayak acts have heaten up, it's naturally been harder and harder to ground out the characters as they grapple with the changing nature of their challenge.

This is why I've particularly enjoyed Visser Three throughout the work. Recasting the Harry James-Evans-Potter hyperrationalist as the villain, as this completely alien figure contrasted against the more human depictions of "rationality" with the Animorphs has been the strongest element of the fanfic. And I definitely think he lead into the Animorphs pondering the same metaexistential questions he was pondering towards the beginning of the fic. Hell, I feel awful I didn't comment on the chapter where he was like "here, I'll just blow up the cube so we can get on with the plot" because that was legitimately one of the biggest "Oh my god!" moments in rational fic. Golden.

The comment that said you'd built up a ton of goodwill after the last Racheal chapter was spot on. Before that I was telling myself "okay, professional writers can't stick landings, don't pile expectations on this fanfic author" but I have to say, you still have me hoping. Even if you half-execute on a satisfying ending my reaction is going to be "Oh man, that was worth the time the whole way through. What series can you say that about?"

But I do want to be, real with you as a fellow author and as a huge fan of rationalist fanfic that maybe this chapter clusters with sections and bobs of recent chapters to be /a bit much/. That's a natural peril of writing by the chapter and far from a criticism of you as a writer - like I said, you don't have me pre-apologizing to myself for your ending - but I want to be honest with you. Might have left yourself with not enough character meat to hang so many chapters of endgame on when it's all so remote and divorced. I mean you had them coming to terms with increasing divorce from the heart of the war like half the fic ago. Did we benefit from all this time spent relitigating their internal litigations?

I post this more as a thought exercise for future rationalist fics, that when you have an endgame that's going to play out to this level, think about how far you can stretch the characters over it. TK17 should always be seen as a trailblazer to this community in its infancy, and we shouldn't be afraid to say "This could have been better", or else we as writers-reacting will never rise above. But we can say that kind of thing, because this fic is firing on more cylinders as you could hope from a fic and TK seems forward thinking enough to take it in stride.

If I'm wrong I can spend some time typing the gushing praise I don't bother with every week because I assume you have a discord full of it, dude. Sorry if I brought you down, love the work
