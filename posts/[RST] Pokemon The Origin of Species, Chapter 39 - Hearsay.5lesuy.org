** Very interesting indeed.

Giovanni seemed to know Leaf wasn't planning on publishing as soon as Leaf /thought/ it, even though she didn't say anything. Leaf seemed to think the conversation was oddly like Giovanni could read her thoughts.

Theory: Giovanni isn't psychic himself, but he was getting notifications from someone who was, hidden nearby. He easily has the resources. Probably spoken directly into his mind, with the phone being a red herring to disguise the psychic involvement. Hence the lack of noises from the phone.

*** Giovanni wouldn't be able to hear a message spoken into his mind, being Dark and all. The rest of the theory seems plausible. The phone could simply be on silent mode, to make it less plausible for Leaf to notice that he received messages.

Besides that, if it was not necessary to use a phone, it would be far more reasonable to not give any sign that communication took place.

**** Yeah, I suspected this too; psychic readings via the phone.

Listing reporters names would have probably been enough for the psychic to monitor Leaf's reaction and identify which ones (Zoey) she responded to. I wonder if anything will happen to Zoey in the next chapter or two.

I also wonder what would have happened if Leaf started suspecting Giovanni during the meeting.

**** Since it's the only Psychic/Dark pokemon besides the mythical Hoopa Unbound, I just imagined that Malamar's evolutionary line has two brains, one dark and one psychic, hence the whole upside-down thing. Maybe that'll prove to be a silly fancy, if Gamefreak adds in more, but so far it would preclude any human from being both.

Good thought though, that would definitely make for a terrifying antagonist :)

*** Yeah, and the fact that he didn't follow up with Leaf about the other reporter looking into it after realizing she wasn't going to publish was a dead giveaway. Forgetting to get that information is not a mistake you'd expect Rational!Giovanni to make, therefore he most likely got the information.

Rather than having a human psychic nearby though, I suspect he was using Mewtwo somehow, possibly in conjunction with the phone. The suspicious chrome ball on his belt is also probably related.

**** That seems unnecessary.

First, Mewtwo's range is apparently "over five times" (IIRC) that of a human psychic, so he'd still have to be relatively close, he couldn't just do it from a lab two cities over. Mewtwo's capabilities may actually be significantly higher than that, but the interlude doesn't suggest that Giovanni knows about that if it's true.

Secondly, why use Mewtwo for such a mundane task? I got the feeling Giovanni does this thought-reading thing a lot. He probably has one or more psychics on payroll who literally just follow him around for this exact purpose. Leaf is a fairly minor player in the grand scheme of things. Even if it is possible for Giovanni to get Mewtwo to help him in important discussions, this is unlikely to qualify. It's not even the most important discussion he's going to have TODAY, since Giovanni's going to follow up with Leaf's source. And the reporter Leaf got the story off is more established and experienced, and thus more of a threat.

As for the chrome ball, I'm not sure. There are non-Mewtwo explanations for that though. It's a rare (or Kanto-exclusive) type of Pokeball which Leaf isn't familiar with, or Giovanni, being a rich man, has custom-made Pokeballs to look impressive. Or it's a special type of ball developed by Team Rocket to try to contain the Mewtwo line. Either way, I don't think it actually contains Mewtwo, or is directly related to 2.351.

It is unnecessary. I guess it was more of an argument made based on story tropes and foreshadowing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if I'm wrong.

#+end_quote

Practice? Testing/training range, obedience, or something else? Teaching Mewtwo that Giovanni wants to use his powers "for good"? I dunno, there could be a bunch of reasons, and while it's an argument based on tropes and outside knowledge that he's probably a "bad guy", there are plenty of possible rational /justifications/ for him to use Mewtwo for this. Sure, I wouldn't rank it as the highest probability explanation if it were the real world, but it /is/ a story, even if it is a ratfic.

You're probably right. That'd be the efficient way of going about it, though risky if he ever unknowingly tries to use it on a psychic who can notice what's going on.

** My interest in signals intelligence had me thinking very hard through that Giovanni meeting and made me all too aware of how Leaf's thinking about the wrong things throughout. Her earlier sensitive phone call made in the clear from a room that was provided for her put me in that frame of mind, and Giovanni showing up sealed it. Going toe-to-toe with such a significant figure who's clearly operating at least one meta-level higher... poor Leaf never stood a chance, even without a psychic next door feeding him info.

Helps to have outside knowledge that he's almost certainly villainous, of course. I feel like he needlessly tipped his hand by leaving when he did, but there could always be reasons for it.

** Hey everyone, welcome back! Aside from the holiday crazyness, I worked on a lot of other projects this month, so I'm glad this chapter didn't suffer in terms of length as a result, and in fact ended up holding the longest-chapter-yet ribbon. This is the first full Leaf chapter too, and as I've always been less sure about her sections than others, any and all feedback is more welcome than usual. Hope you all enjoy it!

Also, I was super tempted to end the chapter at the second line of dialogue in the final section. Not just because of all the busyness of the holidays, but for the sheer cliffhanger value. Consider me finishing the section here rather than another chapter my new year's gift to all of you :) Happy 2017!

I think Leaf needs to do some introspection and think about how much she really differs from Zoey.

** So based on the final section I think we've confirmed Leaf isn't a Dark type. That really isn't surprising. I've never had a problem with Leaf sections, but the research segments I've enjoyed the most have fed us details about other regions or were fantastically original like one old woman's tale on rock-humans. The way Leaf chooses to interact with her Pokemon is a pleasant contrast from Blue. She doesn't just tell us, but shows us that Pokemon aren't just for battling and we rarely see that in the anime.

Barring another event I'm guessing we'll see Blue battling Misty within the next two chapters. It will probably be a mostly underwater battle, but we've seen water Pokemon that are less-than-dexterous underwater (psyduck). And she might use an odd foreign Pokemon like togetic. Or she could've evolved an eevee from Bill into a vaporeon which I'm suggesting just because I've never seen her use one before. The last thoughts I have for Blue are how he'll react to hearing about Giovanni meeting Leaf and if he will meet any of Misty's less famous sisters from the anime while working on the Cerulean lesson.

I don't see any major reasons for our heroes to stay in Cerulean while watching their Clefairy and Abra sales. We'll probably hear from Bill at least one more time- oh man do I feel dumb. The thing Bill wanted Red for has to do with that ticket for the S.S.Anne doesn't it? I can think of a few things the kids could do there. Anyway what else could happen before we get back on the road? We could learn something about the cave Misty found (and someone other than Blue could snag a high level Pokemon since he set the precedent), Bill could get involved, the Abras could be stolen by team rocket, something related to coordinators, someone's Pokemon could evolve and we get to see some training/behavior differences, we could learn about shadow Pokemon from the Orre region, or Xerneas could wake up thus activating the fairy type.

** Although I find Leaf to be the least interesting character of the trio by far (she seems a bit bland) this chapter was quite enjoyable. Started a bit boring, then the tension slowly rose, and kept rising, and then SUDDENLY FREAKING GIOVANNI HIMSELF. That escalated quickly and Leaf's reaction pretty much mirrored the reader's! As for the cell phone, it might Mewtwo shenanigans. Although he could also be dwelling in the Cerulean cave after his escape, based on Misty's mysterious trip. The plot thickens! Now I'm looking forward to Abra silliness and Cascade Badge battles. Thanks for providing us with our monthly dose of OoS :)

** The Grimer/Muk outbreak in Celadon makes me want to draw a connection to the earlier Paras/Parasect outbreak on Mt. Moon, since both locals are associated with Rocket activity in game canon. Maybe it's just coincidence... or maybe both were planned. This is an older thread, but I came up with an essay-sized post, so hear me out?

Grimer and Muk have no real-world animal counterpart (that I know of) to use as a basis for interpreting their behaviour, but in the game canon they do not occur in outbreaks. So I find thier outbreak slightly suspicious (unless DaystarEld is just using it as a metaphor for a backed-up sewage or pollution treatment plant).

In contrast, Paras and Parasect are strongly based on cicada nymphs and the Cordyceps fungi, and the outbreak conflicted a little with what I expected of their ecology.

I acknowledge that Paras do swarm in game canon, but so far that has only been in Unova, possibly as a reference to the real-life periodical cicadas (genus /Magicicada/) found in the USA, which emerge from underground in large numbers after maturing as nymphs for 13-17 years. So in that sense, I can kind of see Paras outbreaks as a natural part of their ecology -- even if Parasect does not advance to an imago stage (it could be relict behaviour from an ancestor), and the outbreak behaviour is transplanted between regional breeds.

(Aside: Isn't it fun to think about what lost metamorphic stage the ancestors to the Paras line might have had, before the entire species and its descendants got ‘jacked by the parasite fungus?).

However, in our world, a Cordyceps fungus needs its spores to reach and infect another member of its target species, rather than purely maximize the dispersal distance. If the Paras are already living and breeding in a colony, then the spores already have access to new hosts without the need to mass migrate to the surface (the Pokedex supports this with a very reasonable statement about Paras being doused in spores at birth). Some sort of breeding migration between colonies could help maintain genetic diversity for both parasites and hosts, but then the most efficient behaviour would be to find other Paras colonies first, rather than head directly for the surface and release spores enmass. Although, perhaps that was what was occurring when the other Pokémon caught in the way panicked in an effort to avoid poison, paralysis, sleep, or fungal infection, resulting in Chp 31.

Since the Paras-fungus spores were described as infecting other species* (the wild Graveller in Chp 31), a breeding migration could also be an opportunity to try infecting new species as hosts, which in turn would learn to flee to avoid infection, also leading to the events of Chp 31. Ants have adapted to recognize and evict Cordyceps-infected colony members before the fungus sprouts. If the breeding migration is seasonal, and a threat to other species, the local species populations would likely adapt to avoid the migration and the threat it poses, reducing the numbers caught in it.

In addition, the Rangers in Chp 29 were aware of strange Pokémon displacements beforehand and wary of something, but never voiced that a large Paras migration could be responsible. And the security personnel Leaf interviewed in this chapter said they did not expected the Paras to chase stronger Pokémon out in front of them. This suggests that Paras migrations do not usually have such a disastrous effect. Perhaps it's a 1-in-10 or 1-in-100 year event. Or climate change.

Or perhaps Team Rocket(?) intentionally agitated the Paras into migrating early, which in turn panicked the other species. Or, the Paras and other Pokémon were agitated into an outbreak altogether. And then Yuuta uses the planned distraction to steal the fossils, rather than waiting to capitalize on a chance opportunity. Later, the same or a similar method is used to agitate Grimer and Muk in Celadon, in order to... distract attention from the Rocket Game Corner? Maybe I'm reaching too hard to justify a chance correlation. But the ability to trigger uncontrolled Pokémon outbreaks at will would be hugely useful for Rocket shenanigans. In GSC canon, they used radio waves to agitate Pokémon into maturing early, so similar experimentation towards agitating them into sudden outbreaks doesn't seem far off.

*The fact that the fungus can infect species besides Paras also surprises me. For the degree of parasitism involved in hijacking the brain, I would have expected the reproductive spores to be highly specialized to only Paras biochemistry. I am not a mycologist or entomologist, but I have never read about a Cordyceps species that targets multiple, let alone distantly related, species.

  the arbitrary limit [of six], seemingly modeled after the standard League maximum

Years ago, I read another Pokémon fanfic (Pokémon 0 by Afroshock) that explained the 6-mon limit as a legal imposition on Trainers. His ideas were that it limited the severity of the threat posed by any rogue Trainer, and it limited Trainers to a number of Pokémon that they could reasonably be expected to care for adequately. That story also implied that Pokéballs were an imperfect stasis and that certain licenses permitted a higher number of carried Pokémon.

*** Heya, thanks for the write-up! I won't spoil anything, but can respond a bit to some of these:

  (unless DaystarEld is just using it as a metaphor for a backed-up sewage or pollution treatment plant).
#+end_quote

Yep, this is basically the understanding those in the pokemon world have of why this sort of thing happens. Some treatment process somewhere broke down, or some influx of substance caused a population boom, or some major sewer artery got clogged, and they basically just overflooded the local area.

Yep! Same with a lot of other plant pokemon hybrids, like the bulbasaur line, though theirs is more symbiotic a relationship.

I should clarify that the fungus doesn't actually hijack other pokemon in a sustainable way: it just uses their biomass as food and keep spreading through spores, without controlling their movements. The paras family is indeed the only species where they can essentially take over.

That's a pretty neat idea too. Hard to enforce, but not if there was a strict ball registration process and the ability to force pokeballs not to work for trainers who try to break it, or straight up teleport them away like in the cartoon (If there's one technology I've basically ignored it's the ability to teleport pokemon into PCs from anywhere, since that feels ridiculously broken and unexplainable)

So the fungus is kind of using Giga Drain? I can live with that.

Agreed. For example, have the Pokeball 'lock' immediately after capture and have it unlock during registration with the Pokedex (or whatever device non-Pokedex trainers use) if and only if the trainer has fewer than 6 unlocked, occupied Pokeballs. The extra Pokemon have to be either deposited or released at a Pokemon Center or other institution. And voila, Pokeball-control; this idea could be used for some neat parallels to real-world gun-control debates.

And naturally, you'd have hackers and cyberterrorists (Super Nerds with grudges?) who would try to break this system, to either unlock their own Pokeballs, or trigger mass lockdowns during an emergency. This becomes an added dimension to each region's cyber-law enforcement, and each department starts commissioning Sliph Co. for Porygon (2 and Z?) specially-coded for this task, and maybe also Bill?

As for Pokeball teleportation... study Abra and other Psychic-types until teleportation is understood well enough to be technologically replicated, as Bill referred to. Miniaturize the technology until it can be integrated into Pokeballs (if it's possible), and have the 'home' location hardcoded to a central depository for each region. At the depository, Pokeballs are sorted by the Trainer No. registered via the Pokedex.

....Maybe I got a bit carried away in places, but that was fun.

***** Thanks for the feedback! I was afraid the Laura scene would come off as a non-sequitur, and it kind of is, but I wanted to show that the trio isn't always at the center of the world's big events, and have Leaf recognize that her sense of responsibility has changed since becoming a trainer.

****** Feel free to disregard this but I think making this about Laura still keeps the trio pretty much front and center in the story. I think reminding the reader about the larger world would be better done by placing the disaster in another country --Leaf can find out by seeing a newscast as she's walking by somewhere or maybe someone else talking about /their/ relatives. I think this would have the following benefits:

1) Makes the digression shorter and more on point -- more focused on what you're trying to accomplish with it

2) Leaf being worried about strangers rather than red's mom would also help underline her sense of responsibility since she would be worrying about randoms as a trainer rather than just about her friends, like any random civilian would, of any occupation.

3) Helps expand the world. Now the digression would be less of a non-sequitur and more of a way to bring out more details about other areas of the world and what's going on there. You can also maybe use this to foreshadow a place that will be visited in the future. Or maybe have one of giovanni's factories blow up to give an alternate explanation to his typing and curtness/hurrying.

******* Yeah, I definitely considered just having it be some random event completely unconnected to any of them, but internally I felt like it was too removed from Leaf's perspective for her to do more than just feel a vague sense of worry and frustration. This first time, it needed to have someone she knew there to really drive home the worry. I also wanted to communicate the idea that their loved ones aren't safe just because they're not out in the world adventuring.
