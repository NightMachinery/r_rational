** I've been waiting for Elodia and Lucia to show up, I love them both so much. Hopefully you will, too! Once you get to know them a bit better :)

Elodia becomes our major antagonist, and Lucia is just chaotic neutral. (Lucia was meant to be more generic but when I wrote her she came out super /sassy/ and I was there for it.)

Vampire politics discussion: I never wanted this to be the focus of the story, because it's a romance novel, but hopefully this adds some tension and some context for the next chapter.

Basically, Elodia has noticed a way to put a wedge between William and Cassius, who are great friends. She wants Cassius, who is her King, to be more loyal to her than some rando Australian guy. Plus, she thinks William might have a weakness she can exploit. Let's see how she goes about it... :)

** Delightful! I just read the entire thing. I like the slow reveal through Red.
