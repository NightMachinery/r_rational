Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are a supernatural entity that feeds of death, with a catch. You know and are aware of your lifespan, which is always a fixed, set limit. It cannot be ended earlier or later than that point, though you may be restrained or damaged to the point of immobility. One thing that differs you from humans, however, is that all parts of your body can regenerate, so the loss of the limb can, eventually, be recovered from. This regeneration isn't sped up from the human norm, however. You can choose where you are initially born, though you appear for all intents and purposes to have come out of thin air. You have one goal: to maximise the number of deaths experienced by sapient beings that occur within your lifespan. Deaths that occur before or after don't matter to you at all, only deaths that happen during it. You are the only entity of your kind, and you know this. Apart from this, you are essentially a normal human being. You feel pain, but only care about it incidentally. You can be augmented as a human would, are about as smart as an average human, and have basic knowledge that a thirty-something human would have in order to end up in the position where you are initially born, as well as the knowledge described here. The final important note is that for all intents and purposes, you resemble an un-aging thirty-something year old human to outside observers, no matter the tools they use. At the end of your lifespan, your body and mind will irrecoverably perish.

Given all this, how do you maximise the number of deaths within your lifespan? For sake of argument, I've got 12 different potential lifespans here, but I'd suggest just looking at the most interesting ones. These entities do not coexist.

- Ten seconds

- One minute

- Ten minutes

- One hour

- A day

- A week

- A month

- A year

- A decade

- A century

- A millennia

- One million years

Finally, for a bonus round, let's say that you are in the position you are now (as a regular old human) and are aware that some time in the next ten years, each of the previously mentioned entities will be born, though they will be unaware of your knowledge. Do you change your life at all knowing they exist? And if you were determined to minimise their impact, what would you do?

For these, I think the way to get the most deaths is by spawning in a hospital nursery and going on a murder spree on infants since you don't have the time to get weapons or use them on adults.

Or maybe spawn in a shooting range, take a gun from someone and start killing. Depending on the people at a range vs. the security of a hospital it's a bit of a toss-up.

#+begin_quote
  Ten minutes
#+end_quote

Spawn in a room where guns are kept, maybe in the house of someone who lives alone and doesn't lock them properly, and go on a rampage in the streets.

Or maybe you'd have enough time to cause a plane crash if you spawned in an airplane cabin and tried to kill the pilots. Maybe punching them as hard as you can could at least render them unconscious?

#+begin_quote
  One hour
#+end_quote

Plane crash definitely. A plane crash into a city if you can choose the right plane.

#+begin_quote
  A day

  A week

  A month
#+end_quote

I don't think you can do more than a plane crash even with this extra time. Even if you manage to kill some people after regenerating from the crash, the police or some authorities are definitely going to stop you.

#+begin_quote
  A year

  A decade
#+end_quote

Now I think the best choice would be to spawn somewhere far from modern civilization to get away from police. Maybe near an uncontacted tribe and be a serial killer murdering them one by one. You could also combine this with a plane crash with a plane close enough to a suitable region.

You might also be able to spawn in a lab experimenting on diseases and release them into the public? Although there's the problem of getting past security.

#+begin_quote
  A century
#+end_quote

Now the goal is to get as many people born as you can while also striving to lower average lifespan. Run as a politician maybe and make policies supporting fast food chains? Something in that line.

#+begin_quote
  A millennia

  One million years
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure by this point you'd just have to wait a while until you can make lots of copies of an AI and then kill it over and over again. Maybe make a popular video game like Sims with actual simulated sapience but hide the fact from players.

Or if AI turn out to be impossible, genetically engineer a sapient species with a high reproductive rate and very short lifespan.

Kinda hinges on whether you count newborns as sapient. And if they do, wouldn't some other mammals count too? If pigs did you would have a much easier legal way of doing this, and could even make money off selling the sausages.

*** Over the scale of anything beyond a decade, deaths are a function of births. So for all of those entries, you need to figure out a way to stop climate change.

For all of the others, global thermonuclear war is the way to go, but how do you provoke it, that's the question! (For the century one, you want climate change stopped and a paradise on earth, /then/ global thermonuclear war.)

*** Are we also allowed to choose /when/ we are born? Obviously, for most of these being born later is better than being born sooner, since that makes the population higher and the background death count (independent of anything you get up to as a nascent death god) higher. For the ten second lifespan in particular, the biggest choice is finding a 10 second window where a natural disaster is abruptly killing a large number of people. But for any of the ones less than a day, you'd want to time things so that you appear around 11AM UTC+8, since that's when the most deaths are happening per 24 hour period, simply as a matter of demographics.

*** The ability to appear wherever you want seems pretty useful for the short time frame ones. Not a lot of security precautions out there that can handle someone suddenly popping into existence.

Ten seconds - Pop into existence on a semi truck driver's lap and jackknife it into a crowd.

One minute - Same thing but with a plane and a building.

Ten minutes to a year - Pop into the White House at night and steal the nuclear football, with the goal of inciting a nuclear war. (I don't think you really have a great chance of pulling it off, but the potential death count is so high that, in terms of expected value, I think this still wins)

Decade - Use your healing powers to convince people you're a messianic figure, run for president of the US, then incite a nuclear war.

Century or more - Use your healing powers to convince people you're a messianic figure, run for president of the US, then push for policies to improve general public welfare and decrease access to birth control. Transition into a public figure with the same goals once you're done. Count on natural human lifespans to do most of your work. Maybe make a play at a nuclear war when your time is up.

*** Can you pick a location already occupied? Can you publicly 'telefrag' a world leader and cause widespread panic?

Failing that, can you appear in front of a major event being live broadcast and say something about the rapture starting and only claiming those who die before X date?

Can you choose your appearance? A Jesus lookalike suddenly appearing would cause chaos, as would a sudden telefragging of Trump by someone who appears Chinese.

** Controlled respiration;

The user can generate heat from anywhere on their body at will, the way this heat is generated is respiration, high temperatures require large amounts of respiration therefore the user needs to be careful that they do not use too much of their body's resources, heat themselves up so high that their body sets on fire, etc.

The above can be seen as a common side effect of using the ability carelessly but can be used to the user's advantage.

The user has a very efficient fat storage capability that can store fat with 100x less space and weight than normal fat cells.

The user has blood cells with 100x greater oxygen carrying capabilities and lungs with the ability to hold 100x more oxygen and 100x faster absorption rate from the lungs to blood cells.

Respiration can be aerobic or anaerobic.

Heart, veins, capillaries, intake and exhale of air in a breath, etc. Accommodate these physiological changes so that they don't break or get damaged under the strain (if you utilise this ability to run for a very long time then muscles will be damaged as normal, this protection only ensures living won't kill you, will not protect you from the ability's use) and you appear like a normal human being externally.

Edit 1: Reverse munchkin: A medieval time period, you are a loyal knight in England under oath to protect your liege and his lands, you also serve as his advisor. A strange new pretender to the throne has risen up, you've heard stories of people and homes he's touched igniting in flames, he's a skilled swordsman and his strikes sometimes possess inhuman strength and he fights for long periods of time as if his stamina is endless, those who are lucky enough to land a hit, ending up seeing his blood on their sword, end up watching their sword burst into flames or exploding and his injuries immediately close back up. He has taken over a small plot of land previously owned by an allied kingdom, all 50 remaining knights were subdued, some out of fear, some out of respect, some like his meritocratic approach to governance and some bloodthirsty who strive to assist in his domination of England. Your liege commands 500 knights, including you, you have no allies or enemies at the moment and there is just one small kingdom in between you and the usurper, the small kingdom is currently terrified and has only 100 knights. The usurper doesn't wear a crown as they believe that those who provide benefit to his claimed lands and goals should be rewarded proportionally so even though the usurper is hot headed and they could die, the peasants have the best chance at moving up in the world and holding titles under his rule so desertion is a possibility, the main reason lots haven't yet is because only one place has been captured so they haven't proven they are strong enough yet to warrant peasants risking their life and joining him, they believe they are safer on the defence from him than on the attack for him at present. Using your position as advisor to your liege and as a knight, guide the kingdom to safety. The usurper does not make truces and won't stop attacking until the current ruler of the land they are conquering is dead and the populace is under control, once subdued they live a pleasant safe life though, kind of like Nilfgaard from the Witcher.

*** I'm assuming the objective in your edit is about beating the dude? Because if not making a job application for becoming his knight seems a good path.

If that's not tenable because of your oath, sending someone else to make said job application that decapitating the bloke in his sleep sounds hard to heal from.

Or juat spread as much propaganda against him among the peasants as possible to ensure his isolation, and to try to turn the small kingdom against him, which may also serve as reason for them to seek an alliance with your kingdom against that usurper.

If you're leading an actual fight against him, his views on meritocracy imply some degree of empathy, slaughtering anyone vaguely allied with him en masse to piss him off without having to fight him to both stress him out and bait an ambush would work, just keep up the slaughter from a number of spread out knights told to split up and flee on horseback if he tries to intervene, since 1 sword can only do so much if no one is trying to fight him.

For the ambush, usurper's been setting other things on fire, but not himself and not directly breathing fire or anything, so leading him somewhere you can encircle him and then set everything around him on fire could work. Alternatively, stamina and a super strong sword arm is mismatched against a deep enough pitfall trap. Oil the sides and base of a pitfall trap, lure him in, then set it all ablaze.

**** Yes the objective of the edit was to create a reverse munchkin scenario :) I shall edit it to make that clearer.

The ideas you have about beating him were super interesting! I didn't even think about the possibility of using pitfall traps, oil flame traps and sleep assassination, I bet they'd be successful :)

By the way, the reason he goes for meritocracy is because he sees people as tools rather than that he has empathy, instead of only allowing people born in certain families to do stuff for him he prefers using whoever works best for the particular task at hand and encouraging them to work harder for him and gain their loyalty through rewards. :)

** *You can give people the sum total of your knowledge and skills, by high-fiving them.*\\
Once high-fived, they instantly know every piece of textbook/encyclopedic knowledge you have (not your personal knowledge), plus all your skills, ATOP of their already existing knowledge and skills.

If there is a conflict between what they already know and what they learned from you (like, say, conflicting scientific theories and definitions) they will remember both, but it would be up to them to decide which is more correct.

EDIT:

They do not realise they gained new skills/knowledge unless they try to access it.

NOTE: Knowledge here is not defined as objective knowledge. It is simply the sum of information you have, whether it is right or wrong.

Munchkin:In your lifetime, improve the life of humans and the progress of science to the point that life these 5 goalposts are acheived: a self sufficient colony on Mars, renowable sources of energy provide most of the power, human lifespan is extended to 130 years in good health, global warming is prevented, general cure/therapy for cancer is invented. Achieving personal or societal immortality is an additional bonus goal and means to extend your time to achieve the goalposts.

Reverse Munchkin: you must stop such person from succeding. You are not given knowledge who they are, and have to find out. They know you are coming to stop them, but do not know your identity either. Neither of you can kill, imprison, or harm the other, this is a gentlemanly game of wits. Reverse munchkin wins if by the time of the natural death of the munchkin, the no more than 2/5 goals are achieved by humanity. To help the Reverse Munchkin: he receives a power to give one year amnesia to people he slaps (they forget the slap as well). This power does not work on the Munchkin.

** Shallow agreement;

The ability to force anyone you look at to agree with you, the form the agreement takes is up to you (what words they use to agree), when people agree with you they don't consciously change their mind about your opinion they just say whatever you wanted them to say.

Munchkin: use this power to become the ruler of as much as possible e.g. country, world, humanity as a whole. I think it'd be interesting to see how your strategy changes due to the time e.g. picking a medieval setting, modern day setting or futuristic setting and seeing how your strategy changes.

Reverse munchkin 1: The person using this ability is an American politician, you are a logger living in a remote part of Canada, you are aware who has this power, how do you stop their world domination?

Reverse munchkin 2: A cat and mouse game, much like death note, scenario, you both have this ability, and are both aware another person has a similar ability, but you don't know exactly how their power works or who is wielding it. How do you achieve the munchkin and reverse munchkin 1? I was thinking the ideal time setting for this would be modern day so that the opponent munchkin can have a variant of the ability that uses touch as opposed to having line of sight, but since this is more obvious and requires close contact they also have the ability to use their ability on illustrations of people that are visually accurate enough to be recognisable (therefore enhanced effectiveness on well known faces that are more easily recognised and attributed to them, more paintings of them, more tv appearances, etc.) and the modern time setting would give them greater access to these things but using other time settings would be interesting too or playing with the variant ability against the default/standard one.

You get a psychic message that informs you:

1. You must survive ten years. After that you will receive a chice to be teleported back to your world.

2. You get ONE minor superpower: you can copy any object. The object must fit through a ring between your index finger and a thumb: extra copy will appear out of thin air nearby in about 2-3 seconds.
