** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylors-gotta-power-worm-dragonball.34428/][Taylor's Gotta Power [Worm/Dragonball]]] is not particularly rational, and has some ridiculous powerleveling implied by the crossover, but there are some neat ideas that I believe you'll appreciate:

- Dinah's power works by giving probabilities of posited scenarios, usually yielding 20+ decimal digits of precision, limited by number of questions per day. Here Taylor devises a scheme that trades this superfluous precision for extra questions.
- Scion is invisible to precognitive powers. Subsequently, putting real-time video feed of him into your glasses and predicating your own actions on his, you become unpredictable to any precognition further into the future than it takes for the signal to reach you.

** Dies the Fire is the first book in the Novels of the Change. The premise is that after a brief light show over Nantucket, all electronics and anything that requires a significant amount of gas compression (like cars and firearms) stop working. As these things are all fairly important to society, the book explores it's collapse as well as the people who work to rebuild it within the new laws of physics. If pikemen riding bicycles sounds wonderful to you, this series is probably for you.

Edit: just thought of another: The Guns of the South, where South African apartheid supporters use a time machine to send AK-47s back to the Confederates in the civil war in an attempt to keep slavery alive. Just as good as it sounds.

** [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/485510][/Nioh/]] is a fun combination of:\\
- The maze-like levels and slow, cautious combat of the /Dark Souls/ series;\\
- The quick, flashy combat of the /Dynasty Warriors/ and (rebooted) /Ninja Gaiden/ series*; and\\
- The endless equipment-effect combinations of the /Diablo/ series*.

I personally think that the game's levels are a little /too/ maze-like. Still, I can't complain about the combat, after beating the campaign and nearly all the optional missions. (50 $ ÷ 80 h = good value, and I haven't even attempted the DLC or gotten very far into into New Game Plus yet.) The sheer quantity of equipment gets to be a little annoying---but at least the player can exchange his unwanted items for a currency that (/inter alia/) unlocks character skins, from the alchemist antagonist to the blacksmith waifu!

*Though I have no personal experience with any /Diablo/ game, I /did/ play a lot of the similar game [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/246840][/Fate/]], many years ago. Likewise, I haven't played any main-line /Dynasty Warriors/ games, but I /do/ have extensive experience with the first three /[[https://www.gamefaqs.com/search?game=dynasty+warriors+gundam][Dynasty Warriors: Gundam]]/ games.

**** Nioh is faster than darksouls but slower than bloodborne. The biggest issue I have is that I am about 2/3rds of the way through and trash mobs can 2 or 3 hit me. It really sucks because your recovery time (from being hit) is longer than dark souls (if you get hit, you will continue to get hit until the end of the enemy combo. You can't really recover from stagger to dodge or block before the next hit comes). To counter this combos are harshly cut short. You and your enemies cannot chain attacks together until you run out of stamina. Each combo has a set number of attacks in it and there is an enforced break after your combo is. That being said I have no other gripes with the game and I Am still playing it. I love both dark souls and bloodborne.

*** I've been playing a GURPS game on a mostly-weekly basis with the same guys for like 5 years, now. It's remarkably deep, but you can wade in slowly.

It has let us run a couple long high magic fantasy campaigns, as well as many shorter stories in other settings - sci fi, post-apocalypse stone age, modern eldritch horror, and one sci fi/fantasy hybrid that felt a lot like Shadowrun set on a fantasy world instead of Earth.

But a word of warning, only use the rules you find interesting. A story about an emergency survival situation you should track food, meals, FP loss, poor sleep, HT rolls to not get sick... in that story, it is the crux of the story. If you're magical heroes battling dragons, on the other hand, the story hinges more on combat and the rules on eating and sleeping can be handwaved.

Unless you're doing an emergency survival situation story in that high magic setting for a session, then you use those rules and they integrate with the rules you were using for combat, and being tired, cold, or hungry makes the next fight that much more difficult.

GURPS is wonderful.

** In another thread I recommended the Jane the Virgin TV series to anyone looking for "rational" drama or romance - it's on netflix and it's really good.

It's got a ridiculous premise (young virgin woman saving herself for marriage is accidentally artificially inseminated during a pelvic exam), and it's in the style of a telenovela so it's ridiculous in general (lots of evil twins, people disguising themselves perfectly as others, etc), but within those constraints it is really rational /especially with interpersonal relationships/ - the mother/daughter relationship shown is very rational, romances start, stop and fade for "rational" reasons, there's absolutely ZERO "let me explain" type of shenanigans.

It is also absolutely hilarious and very clever.

** I tentatively recommend the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime]] series of books.

They start off a standard portal fantasy uplift; more specifically, guy is somehow taken from our world to another (fantasy-type) world. By coincidence, he happens to have sufficient knowledge to attempt to introduce rifles to this medieval type world. There are enough twists to keep it interesting. And no harem.

Plot is interesting enough, and the writing is very competent, but what I really liked was the worldbuilding.

Mild spoilers:

The magic works by a sort of cannibalism. Every sentient being and some animals produce a substance in their brains, called tael, which confer powers after eating a certain number. So if you eat the average output of 16 dead humans it gives you the first rank, then another 32 gives you the second rank, and so on. (it's not specified if it keeps duplicating like that or not, but higher ranks are implied to be very, very expensive. Tael is treated as currency, and ranks are treated as, well, social, military, organizational rank.

These ranks of power can be used for lots of different things. If you're a priest, it allows you to select a certain number of spells from your chosen deity a day. If you're a warrior, it gives you strength and durability and some minor combat spells. There are even craftsman specific ranks, like alchemist, blacksmith, and so on, each with their own unique spells.

**** Forty milleniums of cultivation is good, you've probably seen it recommended around here. I also like Spirit Blade Mountain.

A lot of them fall into the trap where the author isn't sure what to do, so they just write more words. So you need to enjoy them while they're good, but realize that there you're not necessarily going to reach any end or conclusion, and should just quit when it's a good time to quit.

So, for example, I really liked Way of Choices, but at the end of the really big arc, I just decided on my own ending and stopped reading. Or with History's Strongest Senior Brother, I just noticed it wasn't fun anymore and stopped somewhere in the early-middle. Ditto King's Avatar, Legend of the Moonlight Sculptor, etc.

***** I have noticed that. I like the slow building of power knowledge and resources that these types of fiction do well. There is something very satisfying about that. But the “and after they won suddenly another thing happened, and another” it gets.. very draining after a while.

*** Is Prequel the one in which there's a four-leaf clover singularity fairly early on? I came across it a couple years ago and haven't been able to find it.

** I recently discovered [[http://www.nofna.com/index.php?chapter=10%251][Nature of Nature's art]], a series of webcomic graphic novels drawn with the Paint BBS oekaki. The stories all take place in a shared alternate earth where animals of all kinds mysteriously gain "halo brains", and gain sapience, and each of the stories centers around individuals trying to build and understand what society is, often through the medium of creating art. Plus the action scenes are clearly inspired by shounen manga.

It's not perfect, falling into the common trap of far out sci-fi of often making things overly confusing to a newcomer, but I still loved the passion and the story.

** I've finished re-reading Greyjoy Alle Breve, probably my favorite isekai/self-insert fanfiction works, and I'm just utterly blown away by how solid the new world the story develops into. It's a wonderful blend of the historical Westerosi attitudes with the inspired desire to innovate the SI has spread. With a majority of the story told from other viewpoints, and the SI not being the exclusive innovator, and even his enemies seeing the power of innovation, it's a far more realistic depiction of an uplift technological revolution than many other uplift stories I've read.

So my request is, is there any other isekai/uplift stories out there where the actual displaced individual isn't the POV character, or at least not the only primary one? I'd also love uplift stories in something isn't the generic feudal faux-european or Tolkienesque world.

*** A few months ago someone recommended [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/][Paths of Civilization]] which seems exactly what you're looking for, besides not being an isekai and not having MC at all. It's a quest (kind of like a cooperative choose-your-own-adventure story where readers pick what happens from chapter to chapter) that focuses on the development of a civilization starting from stone age nomads. The POV changes frequently, from chiefs and shamans to ordinary farmers and warriors. It's pretty good.

**** I've been meaning to get around to reading that for a while. Jeeze that is a massive thread, I can't help but worry over the fact that roughly a quarter of the threadmarks are staff warning posts.

Some forum threads sure get surreal after a few thousand pages, just look at the one true thread on the xkcd forum...

***** Recommendation:

Use the "Reader mode" button (top right of every page) to go to only threadmarked posts, aka story only.

or use this link: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/paths-of-civilization.36410/reader]]

Takes it down to a more manageable 18 pages, with less clicking/scrolling between the content...

*** I like the genre, but I can't really point at any book that I've read that is particularly great. They all seem to end up being power fantasies featuring a Gary Stu MC. A rational take on the genre would be awesome. Even just one that flips common tropes, like having a female MC or the MC failing to introduce guns.

Anyway, here's some that I remember reading:

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime][World of Prime series]] | 7.5/10 | Recommended elsewhere in this thread. Good so far.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible][Destiny's Crucible Series]] | 7/10 | The last book was pretty disappointing. Sometimes it seems that authors forget why people like a particular genre. In this case, the author focused to much on the antagonists and not enough on the tech and development of the island. I want to watch this guy playing civ IRL, not read 300k words on troop maneuvers and shit. And the epilogue was a travesty. Still, it's passable if you get them cheap and have a dearth of books to read.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43333-conrad-stargard][Conrad Stargard series]] | 6/10 | The MC is a Gary Stu, as always in these books, and the first few are interesting. By the 5th book they get lost in these weird tangents and fantasies by the author. Like, a rotating harem featuring every female in the book, pretty much, and the MC being worshipped as god emperor(a bit of exaggeration, but not much). I never finished the 5th book, but I have read summaries of the sequels and they apparently get pretty dumb.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/144936-daniel-black][Daniel Black series]] | 8/10 | These books are the literary equivalent of deep fried twinkies. Pure, unabashed junk food reading. The MC is a rather bland reader stand-in(male equivelant of Bella Swan from twilight, I guess) and every female with a line of dialogue wants to get on his dick, [[https://pics.me.me/begone-thot-18089971.png][which he valiantly demurs on]], in favour of staying faithful to his (literal) harem.

I still enjoy seeing him build stuff and wreck shit with magic.

**** just finished World of Prime.

Liked it a lot (more or less as Daniel Black). I think is the first consistent world with D&D rules I have seen. They have goblins, gnolls and those-who-can-not-be-named (less form the cost wizards will come and sue you to hell)
