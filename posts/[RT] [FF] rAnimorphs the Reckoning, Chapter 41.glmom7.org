** I found this chapter much more confusing than most. I really enjoy Helium's perspective and am sorry we did not get to see his impression of Jake's black box from the inside. But... The chapter felt like it jumped sections in ways which were confusing. I'm not sure what specifically to point at but I liked the flow much less than usual.

*** I was a bit worried about this, with the biggest concern being the backwards jump to the conversation between Helium and Edriss (which came chronologically first but felt like it shouldn't be the first section of the chapter). Thanks for the feedback; it helps to know not to push any further in that direction.

EDIT: Also, if you or anyone else has specific concrete suggestions, I might make little tweaks here and there. Like, if anyone can say "A sentence like [this] in [this spot] would have really helped," that's probably doable.

**** I would just generally say that Helium's perspective is complicated and layered enough that anything that would complicate or confuse matters of perspective is going to have a greatly exaggerated effect, and this chapter had a lot of those things happening anyway.

1) The chapter started from the perspective of a morph!Helium, which was actually pretty cool. However, his initial disorientation is something the reader is going to share, since we're in his head.

2) After we return to prime!Helium, we get a flashback for expository purposes. Paring flashbacks with in medias res works well when the flashback explains how you got to the circumstances the chapter starts in, but in this case the two were disconnected from each other and it hurt more than it helped. Honestly, I think this would have worked better if it wasn't a flashback at all or, failing that, if the flashback somehow led into Jake deciding to morph-check Helium.

3) The Tiyagi bit, which was another perspective change and was also italicized for some reason?

4) In general much of the chapter is spent in people's heads and in conversation, with relatively little attention being paid to where people actually are or what they're actually doing. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but when the perspective frequently changes and we don't get much of an indication on what's actually different it can make you lose your grasp on where and when the different parts are in relation to each other.

The one concrete change I think I'd advise is dropping the italics on Tiyagi's section. In proximity to the flashback it was confusing and made me think that you were intentionally trying to signal that things were out of order or something. Beyond that, I'd say that in the future having more concrete things happening outside Helium's head would probably help. I LIKE being in Helium's head, it's weird and cool, but it's also really easy to get lost, especially when he's getting lost in thought as well.

****** Part of it might be the suddenness and... what, intensity? of the escape pod plot.

It was like, the Animorphs were discovering info, then extrapolating more info, then acting on their extrapolation, all while there's this very in-universe-confusing situation unfolding with Tyagi, and generally slightly IRL-confusing motivations and goals like you mentioned, and meanwhile I personally was still sitting there grappling with the "Wait, the human race just received alien spaceflight tech a few months ago, and suddenly anyone can just throw together an escape pod in their backyard??? Seriously?" of it all. The ark stuff was mentioned once by Ante (casually enough that I forgot it even happened) and then very quickly it exploded onto center stage. The fact that three hundred thousand humans even COULD build spaceships was so surprising it made it hard to process all the rest.

(In fairness, this might be a blind spot specific to me personally. I was also surprised when Thán built the Dracon beams, and even MORE surprised when humans started not only understanding but mass-producing Bug Fighters within a few months of getting the plans.)

**** Adding "[time] ago" at the top of the flashback would help.

I actually never parsed that it was a flashback and was confused by the use of italics. But if prior chapters use italics for flashbacks, people who aren't reading in real time won't have as much trouble.

If I were writing this, I would have separate font effects for not-a-real-time-experience and not-the-main-character-but-real-time, so that readers would recognize which was which. Eg, one font size smaller for the first, italics for the second.

*** I'll take a stab at it.

I appreciated Jake's caution against getting Marco committed to the idea of himself as being insatiably vengeful or cold-hearted. Because even if Marco isn't actively sabotaging whatever peace plan they eventually come to, a part of Edriss will always be imprinted in him, now, and never forgiving her means he'll never really be at peace with himself.

And now, as I type that, I'm thinking about what forgiveness means in a context where identify is so amorphous, and somehow, that's caused be to realize that if Crayak's goal is to create a single will throughout the universe, the Visser's newfound ability to argue with himself and doubt himself makes him unusable for that, per Crayak's definition. And now victory for Team Harmony means spreading the same capacity to the other yeerk coalescions and the andalite hivemind. Is that a plausible reading?

I might vaugely recall come discussion to that effect from the last Visser chapter but this is what made me remember it.

** Always love to see another chapter come up. Thoughts, all presented post-read in no particular order, potentially subject to future editing:

I'm really glad we stepped back - reasonably quickly - from the blow-up-the-earth plan in the last chapter. I mean, I know that that was REALLY never the goal, and from a narrative perspective I'm sure it was never going to happen. But the deepest, most primal human parts of myself cried out in opposition to that possibility at the end of the Jake chapter, and I couldn't keep up with the characters convincing themselves to commit to the idea in case of a Leeran. (I know they weren't /planning/ to destroy the earth, they were planning to be /willing/ to destroy the earth, which is subtly different. Still not different enough for my... heart, maybe.)

I mean, from a coldly mathematical standpoint, I got it. The idea was to sacrifice seven billion lives (shouldn't we really be rounding that up to eight by now? Especially considering the probably-near-future timeline of this series?) to potentially save tens or hundreds of billions. You pull the lever, the trolley squashes /him/ to save /them/. But the thing is, the math breaks down for me when the seven billion are humans, and the others are aliens. I know the Animorphs pivoted to fighting for the galaxy instead of just the world at some point, but I don't think I ever did. It's more emotional than rational, but I kinda didn't care about all the conquering Yeerks and backwards Andalites and billions and billions of faceless Naharans/Hork-Bajir/Helmacrons/Skrit Na/Taxxons/etc. in the Visser's path - not when it was Mommy Earth tied to the other tracks.

Anyway. The genocidal Animorphs (genomorphs?) have backed off a little. I'm breathing easier now.

I didn't run into the same mechanical problems as some people in the thread. The context of the Tyagi section seemed pretty clear to me - we were following /Helium/, so the fact that we were seeing Tyagi's thoughts meant that we'd jumped forward and flashed back. And the conversation with Edriss - the italics were enough that I assumed it was /probably/ a flashback, but also, like... it kinda... didn't... matter? Like, okay, those events happened /around the same time/ as the rest of the chapter, and the nitty gritty order of events just... didn't impact anything enough for me to care too much. I dunno. It didn't bother me. There /were/ a couple of typos, at least on the AO3 version: Ctrl+f "Was this they key" and "long, history", if you're reading this, TK17. :)\\
There was also a weird extra line break after "‹Eleven percent. Roughly nineteen thousand.›" and a giant stack of them at the end of the chapter, but that may have just been my phone browser.

Personally, the only major thing I've been confused about in these past couple of chapters is what - /exactly/ - they were trying to do with the Bug Fighters before they got... distracted. Marco described it (and Jake confirmed it) as "pulling a Last Jedi" or something like that, but I haven't seen The Last Jedi. I figured out in this chapter that that meant they were gonna potentially smash some Yeerk ships into each other (spoiler alert for TLJ, jeez ;) ), so I guess that was just a backup plan in case attempted negotiations with the Yeerks went pear-shaped?

I enjoyed the part where "/spread/" kinda slipped out of Perdão's emotions. I kinda pictured, like, some sort of surreal meme, like an extreme close-up of a deep-fried Yeerk .jpg with explodey glowing red things over where its eyes would be? And "*/s p r e a d/*" across the bottom? I dunno. It was creepy in a delightful way.

Did the reader actually learn what the deal was with Tyagi randomly withholding weird information? Like, why was she only cloned onto the old Bug Fighters? (For that matter, why were the Animorphs only /targeting/ old Bug Fighters? Surely the human-made ones would have had the same backdoor? I can't imagine the human engineers are capable enough to change things that fundamentally yet. Or did they just get an old one by chance, and dodge Tyagi's question as some sort of bluff?)

Eager to get back into what's going on with Rachel.

Kinda hoping to see Ante step up a little more.

This chapter did move a little bit more slowly, but I was on the edge of my seat at the end of it. Dying to read more.

The plan was to seize one of the ships from the incoming fleet, flash it into Z-space and back, and bring it out of Z-space at near-lightspeed, crashing it into one/many/all of the rest of the fleet. The idea was twofold---one, that V3 probably had /some/ kind of plan for the fleet, and whatever it was it Couldn't Be Good, and two, that if you want V3 to know that you both have, and are willing to use, a relativistic planet-killer, one way to signal that is by glassing the incoming reinforcements without warning.

They had basically written off the idea that they might productively negotiate with the incoming Yeerks.

**** Well that's my lock screen now, and the world is so much brighter. Thank you.

And ah, I see. I didn't realize a Bug Fighter could do that much damage to the fleet, even at planet-glassin' speeds - I was picturing a Bug Fighter coming out of Z-Space and taking down one other Bug Fighter, or one Pool Ship and that's it, but the explosions and the debris and all the momentum and other energy would- Yeah. I get it.

I guess the only question /that/ leads to is one that already kinda sorta poked its head out when humans started pumping out Zenades like they were Zippo lighters, which is, why aren't Zenades already the overwhelming dominant weapon in the galaxy? There's taboo and MAD keeping the Andalites and Yeerks from using them on each other's home planets, but on ships? Fleets?

I guess the MOST likely thing is that it already happens, so it's already a concern, and anywhere else a fleet WOULDN'T risk that kind of exposure - but the Yeerks don't know the humans have figured out rock-flinging technology and so they're not being as careful popping in on our system. Right?

Also, totally unrelated, but if the Animorphs could figure out where the gate is physically located on a construct and surgically scoop it out without damaging the rest of the body, there's precedent that indicates they could just demorph from there, wake up the construct, and rinse and repeat for a quick and easy clone army. Obviously not a situation that's likely to turn up in this timeline, the way things are going, but could be fun if someone out there does a crackfic of the ratfic like that Rick and Morty one from a while back. :D

** REQUEST: I notice there's a trigger warning that includes sexual assault, can someone please describe for me, in clinical detail, exactly what occurs during that scene? (spoiler tags obv). Equally, let me know if that was just a "decoy warning" and nothing of that nature appears in the chapter.

I personally prefer not being surprised by these sorts of things and appreciate the opportunity NOT to be surprised, so thanks, [[/u/TK17Studios]] !

Example for how I'd describe the scene in the The Sopranos Episode Employee of the Month which I happened to see a couple of days ago.

His psychiatrist is entering her car when a man grabs her from behind. She runs and he ends up catching up to her in a stairwell. He rapes her as she fights back. She is then shown in the hospital having her fingernails swabbed and being comforted by her family.

*** Thanks [[/u/Don_Alverzo]] for PMing me with a more detailed description of the scene in question.

I'm reproducing it below in case anyone else wants to know:

The actual content isn't sexual assault. A woman is physically restrained by multiple male characters so that she can be forcibly infested. The infestation is planned to be brief (as it's only for the purposes of information gathering) with the yeerk actually being slightly apologetic as soon as the infestation occurs, but she is nevertheless rather traumatized by the experience. It's framed in such a way that the parallels between a violent sexual assault and a forcible infestation are obvious, aided by the fact that the events are described from the victim's perspective.

It's very uncomfortable, certainly, but if you're okay watching a tv show wherein a violent rape takes place, I suspect you'll be able to read this section. It's an extended and visceral rape metaphor rather than being a graphic depiction of an actual rape.

In case anyone's wondering, about 8 years ago I went through 2 or 3 incidents where sexual assault in media gave me mild, fleeting dissociative feelings. That's not happened recently and although I don't avoid such content (unless it's the focus of a story because such content doesn't especially interest me), but I still really, really, really don't like being surprised by it.

*** Okay I finally read it and here's my thoughts on That Scene:

I found the imagery very, very blatant. Not, like, "oh the author was going for this hard" blatant but like, "I couldn't think about anything else" blatant (it was definitely on the artistic rather than the gratuitous side, so don't worry, [[/u/tk17studios]]). There were heavy references to the kinds of dissociative feelings that I have got in the past from consuming triggering content.

I don't think that I would have had an adverse reaction if I'd read it "unwarned", but that's mostly because nothing I've read or seen has given me an adverse reaction in more than 5 years (maybe it's because I'm a bit more careful now? who knows). But instead of finding it good/artistic/interesting to read I would have been nervous about how bad it might have gotten (though I'd trust our fine author to not include a literal rape scene).

I think it was written really really well, whether it was based on research, personal experience, or just instinct.

**** I AM SORRY THE READING SLOWLY AND LIVEBLOGGING WAS TOO MUCH PRESSURE SO I DECIDED TO JUST READ IT "NORMALLY"

but basically i had the same sort of structural problems following helium as others reported and don't quite understand what happened in this chapter.

I remember that the Crystal Society trilogy guy said, when people asked why he didn't make the AI the viewpoint character in the second and third books like it had been in the first, he said basically that it's hard to write a transhuman AI, and it would be hard to follow first person POV from one if it were written, so I think that is what is happening with Helium on a smaller scale.

My advice to D&D DMs is "make the clues in the story obvious. so obvious you think you're treating your players like children. they will still have a 50/50 chance of getting it". I think something along those lines is there: I need some character repeating everything Helium says in "dumb person speak" and narrating the action very clearly. I don't know how you'd do this, I don't know what sort of person/character would be right for it, but I do know that what would have made this chapter easier for me to follow is if the bug fighter had randomly beamed an 8 year old child on board and Jake for whatever reason explained everything to that child during the course of events. (maybe not quite that bad but you get me...)

Like:

- what is the sleeve or construct or whatever it is? why are people destroying it?

- I know there's a shortcut on earth but why do the anis think that humans are going there?

- so V3... infested all the humans with yeerk pellets? that's what they think? no doubt V3 yeerk clones?

- i completely forgot that in norway or whatever they'd been building escape pods

- i also completely forgot that humanity had built its own bug fighters

- i didn't quite understand the weaposn that humanity has now (the rock yeeting ones)

- probably more but hopefully that gives you an idea about how stupid i am, and i'm not even a stupid person, i'm probably actually a quite intelligent person?

i'm deliberately not going back to read through a second time so you can see the level of confusion i have

We know yeerks infest people and we know how much of a violation that is, you're right, but this /particular/ infestation was presented with incredibly strong rape imagery. The way that it was multiple men forcing a woman down, the fact that it was from her perspective, the sense of disassociation as she tried to cope with the trauma of it, even the way that the actual physical process of the yeerk entering her was deliberately evocative of the physical process of rape...

***** ^ This. I noticed the rape imagery after-the-fact (and then leaned into it/intensified it on the second draft), and found myself "trying to convince myself" that a trigger warning wouldn't be necessary, and then was like "uh, that means I should probably have one."

I agree it's not worse than r!Animorphs has gone before, strictly speaking/content-wise, but I just really really didn't want somebody to be derailed in the middle of what they thought was just going to be some more spaceships-and-aliens.

Note that a good trigger warning /often/ has the property of most people being like "huh?" Like, the point is that people with triggers can have those triggers be something like "surprisingly sensitive" to the average person (with the classic PTSD example being, like, a door slams shut or even just a smell from their past wafts by, and this is enough to start a Bad Day).

** Good chapter, as always. Really weakened by the fact that I don't remember a lot of what was going on but still so good despite that.

Really loving the Jake characterization you got going on, that one line with Helium seeing the person that Jake is becoming/has become the more and more he grows from who he was in his old life was amazing.

I really love your descriptions and metaphors as well, that other line when they were talking forgiveness how certain questions can only be asked one was great, reminded me of way back when I first started this fic there was this line about Rachel and how she didn't exactly enjoy being a warrior but there was a part of her that loved putting it all on the line, a part that had been ignored bc it wasn't useful and now was coming to play.

The characterization is the best thing about this fanfic and you've nailed everyone's character's so well that it makes me wonder what you could've done to Cassie if she hadn't died.

** A few days later...

After taking some time to digest the chapter, I'd say the theme here is 'making hard choices'. Mind you, they've had to make plenty of hard choices during this war, but whether or not to TLJ the entire planet is certainly next-level. We again see the contrast between Jake's and V3's decision-making processes, where V3 was almost nonchalant in his decision to nuke Ventura, and more recently set off bombs in major cities.

Jake asking Perdao to temporarily infest Tiyagi is another hard choice. Morph-checking has elements of infestation, but the morph-host can be kept asleep during the process, doesn't remember the 'infestation process', and is discarded afterwards. If they handwave it off as 'this is just a Tiyagi clone who cares', well, Jake's a hypocrite.

The connection between these two choices is Jake's decision to be a leader who is always on the front lines. 'We' take the bug fighter. Jake is also willing to be infested by Perdao - I suspect this is why Helium asked as a sort of response to the morph check. I mentioned it already but I do hope Jake gets the chance to do it.

** Several points of confusion:

-Did we previously establish that V1 can communicate between her parts? I had thought she was just four separate mini-yeerks.

-What was Garrett piloting? Can anything with thought-speak pilot it? (The first part could maybe be resolved with Helium seeing it barrel-roll.)

-The thing with the cradle being able to store memories or maybe mind-imprints of Andalites is a continued point of confusion. Maybe not necessary to the plot, I just feel like I'm supposed to understand it better than I do. It seems like it provides the sort of ambient thoughtspeak noise that Andalites need? So as an opportunity for exposition, maybe this could come up in the chapter where Ax has a breakdown, and he could explain what it is and why spending time in the cradle won't work?

In general I have trouble with scenes that start in a new location, with a near-term goal that wasn't fully described before. Eg grabbing the tools from the beach, or when they were running from bug fighters in the cradle. The Arn World chapters and the Visser interludes are not in this category. I think the difference is, in these chapters I didn't have to catch up to what the character knew was happening. Whereas in the confusing sections I'm not sure what the situation is before it changes, but the character does know, and I'm not sure if I need to reread something or wait for the character to give exposition.

Garrett had been left in charge of the cradle, presumably in Andalite morph but possibly just granted-permission by Ax/Helium

The cradle can't store memories or mind-imprints, and it doesn't make any noise in the ambient thought-speak medium that Andalites need. It's just an escape pod. Not sure where that confusion might have come from; if you can point to it that would be nice.

**** Sorry for the late reply.

The confusion on the cradle was from Ch. 13, when Ax first woke up. He made repeated references to the eib and the dain. I surmised that "eib" is like background chatter for thoughtspeak, and "dain" is like a model of a person. I thought that the dain (and by association, possibly the eib) were things that the cradle was doing for Ax in the absence of other andalites, bc the dain was mentioned much more when he was in the cradle, he thought-speaks with the model Elfangor in it rather than using the standard italics-for-internal-thoughts, and he steps out of both at the same time.

​

#+begin_quote
  Releasing the recording, I opened the cradle's eyes, looked out at my brother's stolen face.

  <You see the problem, don't you, Aximili?>

  Elfangor's voice, speaking from the dain.
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  I reached into the dain, into the place where Elfangor's voice lived alongside my own. <Help me,> I whispered.

  <I cannot help you, Aximili. I cannot help you see what-I-cannot-see.>

  <But you can see the shape of the problem. What would you do?>

  <Have you not already realized?>

  I hesitated. The dain was never quite real---it was a shadow, an echo, a reflection. But it was also Elfangor---it was a part of my mind that was not truly my own. It could know things that I did not, make connections I wasn't capable of making.

  For a brief moment, I found myself reluctant to leave the cradle. It was small, uncomfortable, defenseless, and cold. But it was Andalite. It had saved my life. It had been a part of my brother's ship.

  I felt myself reaching for the /dain,/ for Elfangor's reassuring voice, and forced myself to stop mid-thought. It seemed wrong, somehow---important, that I do this one part without help.

  Pushing off the cradle with my tail, I stepped out into the emptiness.

** I put off reading this for a few days because I was very much out of the r!Animorphs headspace. Definitely took me a while to remember what was going on. Also, this chapter was very confusing, particularly the ending.

That said, wooohoooo, my favorite fanfic is back for a while! Looks like the ending is in sight, too.

I love how this story breathes life into many dilemmas of decision theory and ethics: at which scale do we draw the line on allowing utilitarianism vs. deontology guide our actions? How does uncertainty affect this decision? What sort of freedom do you have when there are gods who can predict your actions? Part of what makes it compelling is that these things are genuinely uncertain - the characters don't know the right answers, and I bet TK17 doesn't know the right answer most of the time (or do you? :). Part of the benefit of fiction is that it allows you to have a dialogue with yourself, to examine which parts of you are drawn towards which motivations.

A note about the ending: I still don't understand which ship Visser 3 sent the little drone into. At first I thought it was the bug fighter that the Animorphs hijacked, but then it seemed like it was one of the metal boxes sent up by Earth, which just happened to have one of the Marcos inside of it in fly morph... but then why didn't Marco/Visser 1 bring up the fact that they knew about the launch of the metal boxes sooner?

Also, it seems like Visser 3 can create insta-yeerks inside people with the right trigger... that's very not-good.
