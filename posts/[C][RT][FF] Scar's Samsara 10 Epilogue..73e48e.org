** --Spoilers for chapter 9. Go back and read that if you haven't already--

.

The more I think about it, the more I feel that Ahadi does not quite fit as the final villain. Thematically, it really should have been Mufasa: The story starts with the conflict between the two brothers, it's what motivates Scar throughout the story, and then it would end with them fighting once more only to find peace in the end. There's closure between the two this way as well, and it teaches an important lesson about confirmation bias, but it's just less narratively satisfying with Ahadi as villain I think.

I guess I just didn't want to do the predictable "evil Dumbledore" routine that I have already seen so many fanfictions do. That and, uh... Mufasa was such an awesome character whose death was one of those tragic childhood-defining events of our generation, and I just couldn't bring myself to make him the bad guy. :S

*** I really liked the twist, but maybe you should have Ahadi show up once or twice in earlier flashbacks, as memories? Not enough to overshadow Mufasa or make it obvious, but enough to establish that Scar's issues ultimately stem from the jerk that named him "trash"?

** For all of us late/casual readers, could you briefly summarize exactly how enlightenment / red fruit leads to immortality? If find the concept of beings essentially having to 'build themselves a soul' whilst alive in order to access the afterlife a fascinating concept, and one ripe for a rational exploration (just the implications of such a discovery would be stupendous!).

Also, great job on this story! For me the real clincher, the truly made this feel like a conclusions was the classic "You have no idea" line used in a much more innocent, healing context then in canon. Superb!

*** Thanks a lot! That's some high praise.

The whole explanation of how powers and spirits worked was a bit confusing to many, I think. The basic idea is that everyone has the potential for spiritual power within them, but most animals cannot tap into this because they lack focus and will power. However, by gaining enlightenment (aided by mind-expanding drugs, i.e. the red fruits) animals can gain awareness of their spirit and their connection to the world around them, thereby gaining control over the elements and allowing their spirit to persist after death instead of dissipating and becoming just another part of the world.

It's basically the same as in Star Wars, now that I think about it. Probably because both setting are based on the same Buddhist and spiritual concepts.

** Great read, thanks again for writing it!

One minor thing: in this last chapter Scar's language becomes a lot more casual. Calling Simba "Kid" rather than "boy," joking about his good looks. Maybe it's intended to show that he's feeling much less dignified/uptight now, but it felt a little off as presented. Maybe make it explicit if that's was intended :)
