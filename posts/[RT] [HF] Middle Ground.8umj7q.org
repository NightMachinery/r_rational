I just wanted to recommend a story I strangely I've never seen on here before, despite it being a very good example of rational fiction. There is some mild supernatural powers involved, (telepathy, future telling, etc.) but it's strictly hard urban fantasy.

This is more or less a link to the, "main" story that gives you introductions to the setting, characters, and themes. The artist has a Tumblr that posts other stories from the universe using these characters.

The artwork is simple, colorful, and unique. The music is also very nice. There's quite a bit of humor, some of it a little more vulgar. I won't spoil the story itself for you, but it's a very intriguing premise and follow through.

There aren't that many comics, and the series has been discontinued for 3 years, which is a shame because it was very interesting. Enjoy what exists of it, and feel free to discuss it here. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.

I also recommend other work he has done, even if the rest of it is more heavy on the humor elements.


** Read/watched this. Didn't really see what was RT about it, and the quality didn't seem to be especially high.
