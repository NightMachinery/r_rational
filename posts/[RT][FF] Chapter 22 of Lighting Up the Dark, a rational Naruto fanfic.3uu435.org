** I liked how subtly manipulative Kabuto was with Naruto. A compliment here, a bluff there, and he's sold on the whole concept. Seems likely he won't even double check with the proctors that Kabuto actually /is/ a jonin - some of them could be /spies/, after all.

Also, Hinata's technique is pretty neat. I like how you asked yourself what secondary powers are required for canon Hyuuga capabilities, and then went on trying to abuse those in a novel way. Feels internally consistent, not asspull-ish, and interesting.

** "If I wanted to deceive you about X, why would I do Y?" is self-defeating (and a version of Goodhart's Law), because as long as Y is an indicator of not-X, Y becomes useful as part of a deception about X and therefore is no longer useful as an indicator of not-X.

Also, the characters don't know they're in a rational fic (they know /they/ are rational, but not that everyone else is), so the proper answer to "would I be stupid enough to do Y if I wanted X" could very well be "yes, lots of people are stupid that way. It's called cognitive bias, or just making mistakes." Being unprepared for irrational behavior on the part of others is a mark of a Straw Vulcan.

** Also, characters in fics seem to have never heard of epistemic learned helplessness, even though real human beings act that way all the time. The proper response to someone trying to talk you out of an exam fight is to say "In a battle is a poor time to evaluate a proposition, where the proposition is likely to be based on motivated reasoning, where there is little time to evaluate it in, where I can't have peers review it, and where even giving the proposition a fair hearing has costs. So I don't see any point in bothering to evaluate it." Try as hard as you can to win the fight, and if it turns out in hindsight that the argument for giving up made sense, you just got unlucky. Hinata should have just ignored Neji, not bothered to respond or think about what he said.

(Of course, it's a lot more dramatic when characters throw propositions at each other in fights, which is why fiction does it.)

They'd indoctrinate their children into their sacrifice for the clan, to protect the bloodline as it protects their own. The kind of indoctrination that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nwfh6/biweekly_challenge_precommitment/cvuftj9][Free]] demonstrates.

This commitment of their lives to the clan would naturally affect their values, kind of like how the Hyuuga behave in canon but even more alien, and the main/branch distinction wouldn't even come up. Just a sociopathic system producing a unified front. The ingroup is the clan, the outgroup is /everyone else./

Like you said, to be useful the CBS should work like a cyanide pill, if they get you kill yourself for the good of the clan. Strange enough Uchiha didn't adopt a similar method.

The problem with this is if someone found a way to hack it (not theoretically impossible - for example, Orochimaru stops Naruto's seal from feeding Naruto Nine-Tails chakra by forcing his own seal on top of it, and that's a crude mid-combat hack), it would doom the entire clan, rather than, at worst, the branch family.

#+begin_quote

On the other hand, the main family is stronger and better-guarded. No one in the Narutoverse is /immune/ to being kidnapped for their clan secrets. The CBS at least helps a little by allowing the Hyūga to keep the branch family weaker than the main one without turning them into a liability.

You don't get infinite retries when attacking someone. Get caught once and it's a diplomatic incident. Get caught repeatedly and it's a full-on war.

How do you envision this? Getting the Sharingan doesn't enable you to breed new Uchiha, and recreating the Uchiha genes using science is beyond even Orochimaru.

I suppose there /is/ such a thing as kidnapping and forced breeding, but I suspect that would have been a bit too dark for a shōnen anime series. Also, by the time you kidnap enough Uchiha to make that practical and worthwhile, they will find out who you are and Leaf will annihilate you (with the full blessing of every village that doesn't want anyone getting ideas about /their/ Bloodline Limits).

We could come up with a long series of workarounds and counter-workarounds if we wanted to. In the end, any ninja with an iota of caution will not strap a bomb to someone's forehead, no matter how confident they are in their control of that bomb, unless that person is on some level expendable.

We don't know how the Hyūga came to have a branch family with a Caged Bird Seal, but it's not difficult to come up with a plausible scenario from the clan's distant past. "For your attempt to usurp the clan leadership, you and your followers must die - but we will permit you to live on and serve us as a branch family if you take this seal which guarantees you and your descendants can never rebel against us again."

********* endless slavery that still contains the choice of death at any point. the abuse probably wasn't there, originally- that was probably a gradual addition.

Originally, it was nothing more than a personal kill-switch. the passing onto descendants was from the fact that grudges came from binding parents, no matter how justified you were- or at least, the main family thought so. if you're going to have a grudge, have a kill-switch ready.

********** It might even not have been endless slavery at the beginning. After all, the first generation would have included friends and immediate relatives of what became the main family. That might have been part of the rationale for sparing dangerous rebels in a generally harsh and merciless shinobi world (though doubtless pragmatism would also a significant factor for a clan with high power but low numbers). It's possible that the oppression built up over generations as the gulf between the two families gradually widened.

**** Yeah, sure.

So I've just re-read chapter 20, which was where the Sound ninja made their major appearance. After a bit of thought, I think that the largest difference is that in this chapter you spend a lot of time describing the exact effects of the sound Ninja's Technique. For example:

#+begin_quote
  For a second, the air was eerily still, and all sound disappeared from the area.\\
  Then something hit Naruto hard in the chest.\\
  The blow wasn't that strong, not even enough to knock someone over if they were in a defensive stance, but it did have enough force to pop a shadow clone, and it covered the entire clearing in a full 360-degree radius.\\
  But the instant annihilation of Naruto's shadow clone army wasn't the worst part. The worst part was that the wave also popped Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. Then it hit the bushes at the far end of the clearing, breaking the originals' disguises.
#+end_quote

That's four paragraphs in total, purely describing the effects of one jutsu. In contrast...

#+begin_quote
  To an outsider, the Gentle Fist Style looked incongruously like an attempt to slap your opponent, but in reality a Gentle Fist strike could be deadlier than any punch. Precise needles of chakra emitted from the palms could pierce any of the more than three hundred chakra points a Hyūga could see on the target's body, blocking the meridians along which chakra naturally flowed. A sufficient number of hits could do anything -- disable a limb, shut down the lungs, stop the heart... a terrifying amount of power for an art that ignored armour and was dangerous even to block.

  A battle between two Gentle Fist users did not remotely resemble taking turns. Rather, it was a constant dance around each other, limbs almost intertwining as each attack turned into a block, and each block was reversed into another attack. Hinata and Neji's limbs didn't stay still for even half a second, constantly shifting stance, the fighters leaning back and sideways and occasionally forwards as their hands moved in endless elaborate patterns that seemed completely independent of the motion of the rest of their bodies.
#+end_quote

That's two paragraphs, one describing how the jutsu works in a way the reader can quickly grasp, and the second describing the visual implications effectively.\\
Chapter 20 to me read like every time an individual jutsu was used there was a subscene devoted wholly to it. In the latest chapter things seemed smoother because some unneeded flavour text was removed, and the scene was blended together into a cohesive whole.
