SUCH an amazing story. Completely captured my attention since the first chapter and now I can't stop reading. I guess I'm the last one on this subreddit to discover it, but if you haven't read it yet - you really should.

After running out of Worth The Candle I really missed having something awesome to read, and Animorphs definitely fills that void.

Ridiculously fast-paced, amazingly well-written. So many clever twists and ideas. Everything I want out of rational fiction.

At first I was worried that I'd need some familiarity with the original story, but nope, I didn't know anything about Animorphs before reading this and it was fine.

So yeah, if you've seen this story getting lots of upvotes here but wasn't sure whether or not to read it - just go for it, it's awesome, it goes into high gear from the first chapter and never stops.

I wonder how much of it is nostalgia. I never did manage to read the original series (mostly because I wasn't proficient with English when I read them and only the first twenty books were translated to Finnish), but the stuff you write is far more interesting to me at this point in any case. I'll make sure to give a little more feedback in the future if it's something you like receiving!

** Second all this, in case anyone's still on the fence and needs more reinforcement.

I'm legitimately not trying to humble-brag or engaging in Imposter Syndrome or anything, I'm proud of my work and don't mind talking it up when appropriate, but I actually get sad that Reckoning gets less upvotes than my story. The likely culprit is that Animorphs is less popular than Pokemon, but unfamiliarity really shouldn't stop anyone from at least checking it out.

Even if I imagine it being only 70% as enjoyable without familiarity with canon, that still puts it head and shoulders above most fiction I've read, and I don't think it lowers the value of how much /simply good writing/ and /effectively communicated rationality/ there is in it. The author literally was in charge of teaching hundreds of people applied rationality for /years,/ if you care at all about getting more out of fiction than just a good story then it's seriously a must-read.

You'll miss some inside jokes and be less able to appreciate some changes to the world, but the only really annoying part will be the lack of mental image that comes from a pokemon being named, since I spend minimal time describing them (there are just so many it bogged down the writing when I tried it early one).

I share your dislike of that aesthetic, but Animorphs never triggered that same dislike in me. I think it comes down to the fact that the characters don't "identify" with their morphs in any way (in fact a lot of the times the changes are downright traumatic) and rather use them as tools to fight the alien invasion.

The closest you can get is with one of them who gets permanently stuck in a certain form in canon, but this is again treated as something terrible that they have to learn to live with rather than some transcendent experience.

Things seem to move quicker than they did in the books, there's a lot of discussion about details of the mechanics of the setting/more munchkinning than is mentioned in the books, visser 3 is smarter, and the whole thing is more 'mature' in the sense that it's not written for kids (I presume the language in the original books is a lot simpler)- the characters imply a lot of things with few words in a way I'd doubt would show up in a kid's book. It's actually slightly unlikely to hear (13 year old?) kids speak this way- not impossible, just seems unlikely that a whole group of kids would be this smart- but it works for me.

*** The author ([[/u/TK17Studios]]) has put a ton of effort into making all the disparate parts of the Animorphs universe more cohesive. The original series spends at least half of its run being a monster-of-the-week serial, and this results in a lot of one-off developments and plots that /almost/ work but are then dropped, never to be touched again. TK17 takes all those threads (well, the good ones) and neatly ties them all together.

If you're familiar with the Ultimate Marvel comics, the same treatment has basically been done to the backstory. Where originally all the various super heroes are basically make-it-up-as-we-go-along, in Ultimate Marvel many of the heroes are the result of people trying to recreate Captain America's super soldier serum: Hulk happens because Banner thinks he can boost the incomplete formula with gamma rays; Spider-Man and Green Goblin happens because Norman Osborne is trying tons of things to nab the same military funding, etc. It's a relatively small change to the universe, yet it takes a lot of unrelated parts and ties them all together beautifully. Animorphs: The Reckoning does this but better.

That alone makes the world more /rational/, but it's the treatment of the characters that makes the whole thing meet the higher bar of /rationalist/. The kids are all turned up to 11, and each of them has a handle on some aspect of intelligence that gives them a means to contribute without feeling same-y and while also preserving their original voice and characterization. And then of course since they've been given a lightsaber...Visser Three has been transformed from Saturday-morning-cartoon villain into a true mastermind.

Care has also been taken to alter the various alien species to be more, well /alien/. KA Applegate did a good job of inventing cool alien ideas, but for the most part is hampered by the standard sci-fi "everyone speaks English and is basically a human in a rubber suit when it comes down to it". TK17 fixes this by giving each species vastly different values from our own, and in some cases alters even the way they think, to challenge what it means for a thought or value to be universal.

As someone who maintains a tier list of the original books and who regularly reads through them all every few years...there's not really any aspect that the originals do /better/. The Reckoning makes em look like the first draft for this story.

11/10 could not recommend higher.
