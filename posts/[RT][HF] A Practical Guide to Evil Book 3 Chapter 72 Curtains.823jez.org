Seriously, last chapter she was having people assassinated as a bargaining chip, now she's crucifying thirty mages for crossing her, wearing the soul of her dead rival as an ornament and mindraping trusted soldiers because she got impatient. Whatever her new name would be, it's somewhere far, far south of Good.

Speaking of her new name, Black Queen and Black Knight are now officially out. And, with her stabbing a loved one after he lost her trust, we've just passed the third verse of The Girl Who Climbed The Tower and got that much closer to Dread Empress. Things are getting tense.

I mean, how many people did these thirty mages contribute to kill again? They really, really, really have it coming.

On the other hand, I'm still not okay with her planned murdering of subordinates for following perfectly reasonable orders.

**** And the soul-wearing is more a consequence of taking an oath without meaning to, then becoming mostly fae and discovering that the oath was taken, and in fact inviolable. Given the choice, Cat might be inclined to just find a way to put Akua away in a corner somewhere, but the die is cast and there's nothing to be done about it.

Similarly, the chain of command of the Empire doesn't give her a choice but to go through the soldiery to have a word with Black. When Named are above the rank and file, but don't have a pecking order beyond what they establish themselves, you occasionally need to exert your authority to get things done. She called a bluff, when she knew Black would let her in.

*** I haven't considered it but this really does fit The Girl Who Climbed The Tower, you're spot on. "Love ends with the kiss of the knife" indeed.

I think Cat's on a path to become a true monster - more so than even Black, Malicia or Akua. All of them are monsters, true, but they're also human: Akua, who loved her father; Black, who cares so deeply about Calamities and Malicia who reminisces about the good old times with Black over cheap wine.

Cat still has this human element - she had a good time with Archer this very chapter - but I think she will steadily sacrifice more and more of herself to achieve her goals. She already let go of love, how much longer until she lets go of companionship? Already, we've seen her manipulate the Woe. How much longer will it take until they're only tools at her disposal?

***** I can see why you are doing the comparaison, but it's clearly wrong. The whole point of PGTE is "I am Cat, and I have a plan for Callow". Even before getting the Squire name, even meeting Black. She has a plan since the very beginning, and she try to stick to it (with more or less success).

Taylor had no plan. She is changing her mind multiple times during the serie, reacts instead of acts, tell people she is doing things "for the greater good" while she is absolutely not. She is lying to herself from the very beginning to the very end. She manages to do the difference against Scion by pure luck.

Cat is nothing like that. She is going to the path of Evil by Choice (and "It is, we are told, the only choice that ever really matters."), not because of some shallow circonstances like "I love my friends" and "Me, a teenager, think i'm doing a better job than everyone".

****** I contest the first and last quote lines in your comment pretty heavily. From the beginning her "plan" was to join the military and become an influencer. Lots of open space between plan start and finish there. And I'm pretty sure her - a teenager - thinking she'll do a better job than everyone else is one of the fundamental underpinnings of her entire character.

More broadly: Cat's goal is "uplift Callow", but other than some broad strokes regarding ejecting outside influence she's kind of vague on how exactly she intends to achieve the end state she's shooting for. It kinda seems to boil down to "put myself in the absolute leader position by acquiring power/influence".

All the concrete/enduring steps she takes seem to be spur of the moment things: She dismantled/suborned the dark guilds when they got in her way, but IIRC this wasn't something she had set in stone earlier, it just happened because they inconvenienced her. Setting up Callowan rulers was (for a time) achieved via taking advantage of the aftermath of the rebellion she (arguably) instigated, but again it wasn't like she went into the fight with sword guy with that plan in mind. Again, IIRC it was entirely spur of the moment.

I think that last event illustrates my point, in that after the rebellion she was in a prime position to take advantage of it but hadn't put a lot of thought into effectively doing so. The plan she enacted (mixing Callowan and Praesi on the board of governors or w/e) wasn't a strong one, and I don't think it's uncharitable to call it naive. It was vulnerable to Praesi subversion (which she knew - scorpion and the frog and all) and it was vulnerable to her not being around to actively police things (which as a Named without a big support base and being driven by the gods/narrative was probably inevitable, Fae incursion or not).

I think there are a lot of parallels to Worm there, especially Cauldron. They had a goal to spam superheroes and hope for the best; they didn't ever have a plan to defeat alien god man. And much in the same way they did a lot of bad stuff in pursuit of a goal they ultimately didn't achieve, Cat seems to be committed to doing whatever it takes to achieve her goal of being boss of Callow. She's banking on being able to change things once she reaches that position, but I kinda worry she'll finally reach the top and realize she ended up sacrificing the majority of what drove her to reach her goal. I can definitely see parallels to Taylor there.

Edit: because I just realized how this post might be taken - I'm in no way implying that PotG is at all derivative of Worm. The trope of lawful evil (or w/e, I'm not that familiar with DnD) hero making things worse via tunnel vision is not a new one.

******** To be fair, that was her view with the information available. At the time it was both impossible and undesirable to attempt to resist the Tower.

Impossible was obvious, but undesirable because they'd have no chance to rebuild and end up being a constant graveyard while being invaded by everyone in turn (which we see in the Fourfold Crossing).

But now that the Tower is weakened, all the major Legion generals but one have been slain (and all the other competent ones being under Cat), all the major legions being gutted, the Tower having its primary magical superweapons destroyed or subverted, and it's major living heroes either unwilling to stop her or actively aiding her, resisting the tower went from /impossible/ to /very possible/.

Now that Malicia has shown she will backstab everyone, even her best "friend", that she is willing to sell or give out secrets as part of her plots, that she has no qualms about using a superweapon that will ensure a MAD scenario, that she is willing to throw away the Black-inspired "new villainy" for the old-school villainy despite all those decades of worth... well, it's gone from /undesirable/ to /can we move this along faster please/.

She shouldn't have gouged his eyes, she was well within "good" morality to straight-up kill him.

Killing major heroes? Are you referring to the one that threatened her friends and was apparently killing one each hour? Or are you talking about the other ones that were trying to kill her directly? Because none of what they were doing was particularly /heroic/, or even /good/. And if you are trying to kill someone, they are quite within their rights to stop you by any means necessary.

I don't remember the children, so unless you're referring to collateral damage, the S9K clones, or underage heroes (ie: child soldiers) attacking her, you'll have to clarify that one.

So far, none of those screams "evil". They are not particularly good, but can be done by a Good character. In the case of the eyes, it was her trying to find a good solution... /and she knew they would grow back/.

When surrendering at the height of your power, you have the right to dictate terms. Instead, Alexandria refused to give her the slightest shred of credit or respect and chose to provoke her as much as possible by convincing her she was having Taylors friends hunted down like animals. All in an attempt to twist the system into allowing her an opportunity to literally enslave Taylor.

Even if she fights against villain villains and villain heroes. She did pretty shitty things, and clearly deserved to be punished for that. She thinks she is doing "good things", but she is only self righteous.

And no, when you surrender, you surrender. It's the point of surrendering. If you are threatening people if they don't meet your conditions, you are not surrendering. And if you are an enemy who is not surrendering and will do aggressive actions very soon, you will be treated as an enemy who must be dispatched.

I think your expectations of a formal military surrender that abides by your precise rules are a little off base when you're talking about civilians.

As a civilian, though, her definitions of it are not as precise as what you hold her up to, and she didn't have the necessary time to work out the details when it was going down.

In addition, how many weak spots does he have to her bugs? Did you consider the fact that 99% of his surface area is immune to her attacks in your calculation, or does he just count as Joe Schmo Regular Guy in the morality court?

Apparently you don't understand the concept of a "mercy kill". If the person's death is better than the alternative (in this case, being tortured by the world's craziest psychopath and experimented on by the world's most skilled bio tinker into being a mental and physical monster to be cloned repeatedly into many broken forms to be used as living weapon/child soldiers), you may have to choose the "better" option. Is that Good? If it isn't, it's not Evil either, but firmly in the Neutral category.

As for Alexandria--that "Hero of Heroes" was (as far as Taylor knew, especially since she trusted Alexandria to be true to her word) *killing off her friends one by one*. Just like how killing someone in self-defense when their goal is to kill you does not qualify as an evil (or even illegal) act, neither does doing so to protect another person.

Taylor is quite firmly in the Neutral camp because she has a mix of booth Good and Evil, and while she's done some terrible things, she doesn't generally do them purely out of self-interest, for fun, or out of laziness. She /tries/ to do the right thing, but often is in a situation where she can't, and compromises must be made.

You know, almost like a deconstruction of your "typical" black-and-white morality superhero universe.

*** I kind of thought the whole thing was each of them indulging in self deception: archer claiming she will leave, while she gets all friends forever with cat, and cat musing that her work will be finished one day so she can holiday with her bff. It seemed like both of them knew they were talking baloney, but it was nice to lie and not be called on it.

Really, neither of them expects to live to see any of those plans come to fruition.

** Cat's apprenticeship to Black started when he stabbed her with a knife to give her a Name dream. It ended with her stabbing him as a reminder of her goal to build a better world.

At the same time, I feel Cat's ideas are once more undermined by her hypocrisy. She tells Black to become a better person so he can fit in the society she builds while at the same time using shadows to devour soldiers because she's impatient... That's a bit of a double standard there Cat. You don't even feel bad about it.

The reason for exiling Black was motivated by her feeling of betrayal more than any calculated reasoning in my opinion. Black's involvement in the Akua situation was about the same as Cat's - he dealt with the problem in an effective manner. He didn't know much about the super-weapon being built or about the killing of a major southern city. If he did, I imagine he would kill her in her sleep; it's exactly the sort of thing Black fights against.

Blaming Malicia, on the other hand, would be perfectly reasonable because she had both the knowledge and the means to stop Diabolist, but she didn't. I'm surprised Cat is not frothing at her mouth at the thought of the Dread Empress.

*** I think that, right now, Cat is too busy wondering what Malicia's next actions to be angry at her. Also, she already discussed with the Empress about the whole "helping Diabolist destroy the world" thing so it's less of a sudden development and more of a scale to settle later.

As for hypocrisy, well, it wouldn't be Cat without some. She at least acknowledges that isn't fit to live in the world she want to build either.

So... what does she become now? Black Knight and Black Queen are out of the window.

** So, I know EE probably didn't give us enough to piece together what Cat's first scheme in her new Role would be, but my bet is on her faking Thief's death to create an opening. What are your thoughts on why else can they need a body double that's going to (at least for now) be kept out of sight?

Also, I'm almost as fascinated as Black that Cat broke the stupid succession story. Would his fight with White Knight in Nicae count as a beginning of a pattern of lose-draw-win? I'm guessing not, since Hanno doesn't seem to have much agency in what he does, and Black's primary opponent was the Bard.

*** Faking Thief's death is an interesting idea. I was thinking Vivienne would be sent to the Tower to steal their gold or spy on Malicia. The body double could be used as an alibi and a cover since the Empress likely has spies in Cat's camp.

  Keeping the damages to a minimum had failed, that much was obvious. It'd only ever been a mitigating measure anyway, not a plan. One of those was taking shape in my mind, even as I gathered more and more soldiers to my banner, but oh the risk of it.
#+end_quote

Cat has the inklings of a risky plan for the crusade/civil war. And she wants thief to go on a secret mission. What MacGuffin (armada or smaller) could be plot relevant to a villain/monster/demigoddess taught to eschew magical MacGuffin in favor of force, maneuver, and intrigue?

The Black Knight is evil.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Sheba][The Black Queen is good.]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow_Queen][The White Queen is evil.]]

She's a winter-oriented fae-adjacent magic-using queen who is pro-order, pro-evil. Cat is Jadis.

Also: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum][Aksum is a real place]], as is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant][Levant]]. Still not sure the setting of Calernia doesn't have some relation to Earth like the Bastardverse does.
