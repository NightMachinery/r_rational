** I started reading from the start because I accidentally clicked on this post and thought I'd check it out anyway. I really liked the writing by the 3rd book, and have it in my serial fiction tab collection on my phone that I spam refresh now that I'm caught up lol

The Daily Grind reminds me, in bits and pieces, of another book I'm currently working through (Bellwether by Connie Willis.) It's fun, but I'm not sure if it's rational fiction or not, I mostly just seem to enjoy the genre more than most without being able to independently gauge if something qualifies for it myself.

*** Personally? I wouldn't call it rational in the way this subreddit generally does. Which is not to say I don't want to write characters that aren't idiots and objectives that are explained. I want the magic systems to be comprehensible, so people can point out to me when I've missed something obvious (this happens regularly). But I don't think it's the same degree of rationality that other works shared here have.

**** Hey! The author! It's cool to see you here. :) I want to say as a person with amazing poly friends, I really really liked coming across a healthy wholesome triad in the wild. I immediately recommended it because it's awesome (although I had to warn about how you wrote Dave as a possible autistic person as they're all autistic and... the characterization with when you were setting him up to be a bad guy at first... it's, I'm glad it's gotten better as the story goes on.) Also, is Nikhail(sp?) a transman? I think that might have been implied and I was very happy.

You've actually inspired me more to actually write something.

And also imagine how. much. better. I could make my life under capitalism, as multiple copies with mind sync: tagging out with a copy on work breaks to conserve mental energy and defend from repetitive stress pains: the ability for chores and having one not on a night shift sleep schedule to take care of business hour chores; work on personal projects... (and all the drama of logistics like if it would be possible to get health concerns address across multiple bodies with the same identity without being prosecuted for insurance fraud, lol))

Edit: also as an actual reply to what you said, I was actually meaning I wasn't sure if Bellwether was a rational fic, but if you have time to read I recommend it! It is a sci-fi in capitalist framing fyi, sort of complimentary to Douglas Addams writing too)

***** Oh! Whoops! I misread your original comment, that's my bad. I'll probably check out Bellweather though, as anything described as 'adjacent to Douglas Adams' sounds pretty good to me.

Nikhail is trans, yes. Anesh is probably being investigated by at least one insurance company, also yes. And I'm really glad that you're getting into writing your own work!

Also, Dave was originally written to be kind of a jerk, and was not originally written to be on the spectrum. As with most things, I didn't have a plan going in, and just sort of felt out how the character reacted to the world and developed. This was about at the same time that I was noticing more in real life how neurotypical people in America seem to perceive people on the spectrum as being rude or impolite, because they lack an understanding of what's driving that behavior. And at the time, it just sort of fit with where Dave was as a character, so I shifted gears and went that direction. I hope it worked out in a way that isn't awful.

Anyway, thank you for your comments! I always appreciate feedback like this.

*** I've been enjoying this but find it frustrating that things like money issues exist when the organization has so many supposed intelligent people and access to a matter duplicator.

**** Yeah. I get that, It seems like almost everybody would have more ideas about it if they were aware of the problem, but maybe it's that it's not a highly publicized problem in the organization itself yet. Though maybe it won't be publicized to avoid main members thinking more capitalist mercenary-ie as a culture...

I do like that the characters aren't all competent in every single area, and things go wrong apart from the current problem they are focusing on. Hyper competence in every single area seems to be an opposite trap that some new rational authors fall into. Or at least associated material that gets recc'd on this sub. And the scale orbs and other power-ups are a nicely satisfying relief from that frustration with changing up flaws.

I chose to interpret that it's also showcasing what only a few people actually trying to keeping things organized looks like in a huge organization (even without constant issues/crisises). And things constantly slipping off your plate, especially since the main character who's approving/spearheading most things has ADD (which I can reallllly relate to.)

Good news though, the latest chapter does be like oh wait we have a frickin gold ore vein. So I think that will get addressed soon, with more smooth acquisition brain power as the story progresses since it's now been reaffirmed as an ongoing scale problem to address.

**** Oh it gets so much worse than that. It's just full of irrational stuff like that. I'm almost caught up and I think it was worth the read, but so many parts of it cause me so much pain it should come with a trigger warning...
