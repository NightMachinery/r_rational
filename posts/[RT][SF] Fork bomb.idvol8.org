Working on my thesis is great, but have you tried saying "to hell with it" and writing a science fiction story about economics and simulations all day?

About ten minutes reading.

** Nice, but IMO the premises don't really work. First, it's even explicitly pointed out: "We don't need to program a simulation in this world for it to happen. It could just emerge." - in the middle of a discussion involving a programmatical switch which makes a simulated scientist start a nested simulation. If a nested simulation could just emerge (which is quite plausible), then the switch is useless. And second, a simulated world with a finite amount of resources could exhaust host's computational resources only if the simulation can expand its amount of simulated matter somehow (by exploiting a bug which allows violation of conservation laws, or by not having those laws in the first place). Otherwise, the worst that could happen is a paperclip maximizer which turns the whole simulated world into a perfect engine for a nested simulation.

*** Great points. I considered your criticism and changed the switch to a trigger. So the simulation could emerge any moment, but the trigger starts the process immediately.

Your second point is actually very interesting and worthy of another story. Perhaps the world is a simulation, where the conservation laws are hardcoded, but the corner case of conservation laws in nested simulations is overlooked, and it could be exploited to crash the whole system from within.

I think you basically summarized the idea of my story with your paperclip maximiser analogy: what happens if you have infinitely nested simulations. Except I didn't consider the simulations being ideal simulation engines as well, which actually makes the idea more interesting

That might be possible if nested simulations are considered to be a special case by the simulation engine (rather than just another way for inhabitants of the simulated world to use their resources). Interestingly, the existence of a nested simulation trigger proves that it's indeed so for Bernard's engine :)

** It might be interesting to you, that the story is inspired by reality: [[https://blog.einstein.ai/the-ai-economist/]]
