** Have we started some sort of charity work/ public works program yet? Providing alternate jobs and getting some wider intel would be good. It synergizes well with our radios.

Any good work on finding a chemical that can stop diseases?

There seem to be a number of crimes commited by high profile criminals. Robbers and such. We should also contact some veteran organizations, find some good quality soldiers. If we do find these individuals it would be good to have an armed response team to handle them. Suitably separated from us of course, to avoid direct responsibility. Maybe see if we can set up a sting operation with some jewelry and a few concerned 'civilians'. Beef up our own security on any diamonds or gems we have.

Do some research into the shipments, what the mayor was involved in. Try to work out if there's a common element. Pay off some of the dockworkers say, see if something else was being shipped.

Make sure some of your own people are near Strange. Reliable, solid people. He's going to be an obvious target if we start imprisoning people, we need to have someone watching out for any weirdness.

Contact a few major churches, see if they have any records of this ghost, or if they have any history with handling ghosts or spiritual things. Are exorcists a real thing? I don't know in this world. It might just be a mundane man or someone with metahuman powers, but better to be prepared.

** So, five intended avenues we have to pursue.

1. Getting loyal minions to gather information, fight major criminals. Exorcists? Veterans? Metahumans? Spies? People to watch Strange? A public works program?

2. Teching up. Radio tech. Disease curing tech. Enhanced armor. Lead in the environment. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/373fv6/ff_the_gothic_man_chapter_two_limiting_resource/crkoi78]] we're rich, we have science, we need the tech advantage over our enemies.

3. Alliances with potent decision makers. Strange, Mr Dent, mayors, police chiefs. They can sway lots of people, and with our money and charm we can buy a lot of influence, and press anti corruption reforms.

4. Buildings of great utility. Hospitals, women's health clinics, radio towers, hair dressers. We need more information, to cure people, to win people to our cause.

5. [[http://www.northyorkshire.police.uk/tenprinciples]] ideas and philosophies we can spread across the city to make it a little bit harder to do crimes and be bad.

6. A power ring.
