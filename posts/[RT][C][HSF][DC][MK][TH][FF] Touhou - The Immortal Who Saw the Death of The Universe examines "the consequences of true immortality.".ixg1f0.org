** I really enjoyed this! Only have a shallow understanding of the Touhou universe, but I could tell lots of care was taken to make sure the rules of the character powers were followed as accurately as possible within the realm of the story. Thanks for posting, and for working on it!

*** Yes, the intermission pages in particular seemed a labor of love, explaining how the powers function and addressing issues like "depression after existing alone on a lifeless planet for billions of years". And the EEG brain wave scans made me laugh.

Just to clarify, I did not work on the comic and I did not work on the translation, but I'm glad you liked the recommendation. Hopefully I will find more examples of rational manga to share!

** I'm back after a long break with another comic. I've been sitting on this one a while, but it applies Touhou abilities to an imagining of the actual progression of time on the universal scale; the title is quite self explanatory. This is not a "fair-play whodunnit", but readers familiar with Touhou might like to try and anticipate some of the solutions presented.

I know that this is might be outside of the usual comfort zones, but I hope that anyone looking for a short rational sci-fi manga with fantasy elements will get a kick out of this. Please leave a comment if you liked or disliked the story to help me learn for my next recommendation. :)

** I like this one. I don't know anything about Touhou abilities but it was an interesting read.

** First of all, I /adore/ this story. It's my favorite doujin, in pretty much the entire genre.

It's harshly realistic, very interesting and educational (albeit in a popsci level at best, and with fiction freely interspersed into fact). Patch apparently forgetting that the outside was vacuum was... quite a down-to-earth fail.

I suppose there are certain things you can't do together without ending up friends, and rebooting the universe by causing a second Big Bang is one of them.

That being said, it doesn't stand up to scrutiny at several points.

Eirin should've known how problematic her original expedition was from the start. It would've taken only elementary calculations concerning velocity and the universe's size. Nothing about the timeline should've been surprising.

One of their feats should have (and might have; it's not entirely clear) been to build an entire society of robots in order to build the warp ship. In this case, there was no reason they couldn't have built enough excess to start searching the Earth for Mokou. They weren't exactly lacking for search time.

--------------

Other things:

They never actually solved the fundamental issue in-story, only delayed it. (Eventually, unless they start making advancements posthaste, they'll run out of time again and, after however many repetitions, make a mistake they can't recover from.) Eirin should probably have rewrote the laws of the universe while she still had root access. My headcanon, naturally, is that she did, but nothing of the sort is implied in-frame.

Also, she just left Kagyua behind on Earth? And Kaguya allowed herself to be left behind? Her reasons don't make all that much sense; nor do her reasons for not having had the exit vehicle close-by to begin with, so that she didn't have to take a century to search.

Remilia changes the fate of the universe from Big Rip to Big Crunch? LOL I knew Touhou powers were OP but this one takes the cake.

(Actually, maybe a cosmologist could chime in. Could the addition or subtraction of a minuscule amount of mass, ex nihilo, change the eventual fate of the universe? Maybe it's not so OP after all, albeit over exceedingly long time periods.)

Finally, and most obviously, there's the outright fiction where the immortals can, apparently, influence the universal laws at certain times and places, for no apparent reason. I suppose we'll just have to let that one go as artistic license (and, admittedly, the imagery from those panels is beautiful), but it does seem like a bit of a copout.

Endings which would've felt less like copouts (and, incidentally, solved the problem of immortality):

- Sakuya just freezes them all, forever

- A cyclic universe where each iteration /must/, due to undiscovered physics, be identical. (Admittedly, this doesn't explain where the current immortals went; but since they didn't exist in the "current" universe, one may surmise that either the second big bang ended their continued existences, or they replaced their analogues somehow. Maybe it turns into a bit of "Story of Your Life", if they're mentally replaced but can't actually do anything differently.)

The copout ending really was good, though, so I'd probably be satisfied with some BS metaphysical handwavium as to how it's even possible.
