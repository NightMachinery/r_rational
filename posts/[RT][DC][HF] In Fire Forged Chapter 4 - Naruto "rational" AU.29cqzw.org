** Review reposted from fanfiction.net, in case anybody wants to reply to it:

This is by far the best rationalist!naruto fanfic I have read so far, and there's been a surprising number of attempts. Your writing style is really good overall, far far better than Time Braid which you compare your fanfic to. However, your descriptions are strangely lacking, especially those of other people's appearances. All I know of Izanami is that she has two swords, and I have no clue what Sakura's parents look like! This makes reading about them very strange because I have no picture in my mind of what's going on, which damages the immersion. I guess you could say this is representative of your Sakura if she really never pays attention to what's going on around her (In a way she feels more like canon Naruto than canon Sakura), but it still seems strange.

Your science-y passages are very nice. However, bear in mind however that their perspective on mundane physics is likely to be very different from ours on account of the people of the Naruto world growing up in a world with chakra. To them, it wouldn't seem as if chakra is something weird tacked on that breaks laws of nature as it does to us. They never had the benefit of our perspective. Naturalism/reductionism might never have caught on in the first place, since it certainly seems as if things like souls exist in the Naruto world.

I really like your realism tack and like others here I hope that it stays that way and the story doesn't go the way of the Shonen. A realistic portrayal of chakra-powered ninja would be really cool. Please steer clear of Ender-style 'it works because I said so' combat plans, especially the kind that character's come up with in between sword swings. Sakura's fight with Kakashi seemed a little like that to be honest. Ask yourself: "What would I do if I had these powers and I was in their situation?" You probably wouldn't risk blowing yourself up. You'd probably be terrified of explosive tags and ninja techniques and fighting with real swords, even if you're the one using them.

One last thing: Please make sure that you show how characters get their powers. I think a huge flaw of HPMOR is that HJPEV starts the story with "oh hey I have super science knowledge and rationality and a huge amount of gold and international fame that nobody ever saw me work for, don't mind me while I prance around and tell everyone they suck and get away with it." I think a good rationalist story show show why characters can do what they do, and how. Think of Brandon Sanderson's First Law:

"An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic."

How do Sakura's seals work? How did she learn them? What are their limits? How did Naruto get wind techniques? How do elemental techniques work? What are their limits? How does the Sharingan work? how did Izanami learn to use Genjutsu with it? How does Genjutsu work? What are it's limits? And so on and so forth.

*** Thank you very much for the review - I appreciate the detail and thought you've put into it. TL;DR: Thanks for the review. Explanations and thoughts on various aspects of the story. Regret that I couldn't write even more without truly overstepping some kind of boundary.

I have a tendency towards writing walls of text and I think your review deserves a reply in depth. Also, there are a few thoughts it prompted that I'd like to put out there as well in case anybody wants to offer their thoughts, so prepare yourselves!

I'm very glad you think so highly of my fic - I'm not even sure what to say to that kind of praise. In lieu of doing some uncomfortable modesty/impostor syndrome routine (which I otherwise would), I'll say that I certainly appreciate the compliment, and feel even more motivated to write when I hear it. Every little bit helps - that, and the many various commitment contracts I've engaged in to combat my chronic akrasia!

You raise a lot of good points - several that I've thought about a lot myself, and several that I'm definitely going to think more about.

Your point concerning the lack of character description is well taken - I'm adding this to my list of things to revisit when I do my next row of backwards edits. I think perhaps I veered on the side of overzealous editing after my first drafts were far too heavy on description and exposition. What I did before didn't work either; I simply dumped a paragraph of description at a roughly appropriate time, in the middle of everything - it interrupted the flow. Apparently it's best to be really sneaky about it, so people hardly even notice you're describing the character, but that can be hard at times.

Also, a few scenes that didn't make the final cut had some of this description, and I forgot to transplant a bit of it over when I threw them out. A lot of it was also lost when I decided to cut an entire finished "interlude" chapter (the evening of partying in-between chapter 3 and 4), which broke from Sakura's POV and had 3rd person POVs from all of the "rookie nine" characters and touched on which changes they'd seen in this universe. I'm considering instead publishing the chapter as some additional voluntary reading material in the break between volume one of the story, and volume two. I've got a lot of extra material to post in such times that I couldn't fit in anywhere else.

For that, you can blame Eliezer Yudkowsky - I almost had a heart attack when I woke up in the morning and saw that he'd reviewed my story. When reviewing chapter three he said I needed "plot tension, fast", and when I thought about it, I happened to agree, so out went the party interlude chapter. I also changed chapter four around /quite/ a bit (rewrote almost half of it), and chapter five now needs some heavy editing as well to fit in.

Regarding science and physics, with our "physics with chakra tacked on" perspective and their "physics including chakra" perspective, I think this post would become too long (it already is) if I tried to fully address that without spoiling everything. Suffice to say, I've thought a lot about it and I think that, from what you've said here, you'll agree that it makes sense later as more information is revealed.

I'm certainly going to try my darndest to stay with down-to-earth realism and I hope to avoid the typical ridiculous shounen power progression - /particularly/ the New Powers As The Plot Demands aspect of it - it's no fun when people just conveniently pull powers out the moment they're useful, or worse, forget about them again! This isn't supposed to be a story about superheroes and larger-than-life figures, it's supposed to be a story about humans.

I realize that I sinned in the bell test fight, but it was a conscious choice: I felt that I needed to establish the credentials of the story with a "boom" in the first two chapters, and that provided me with some very limited setup time to do exposition and foreshadowing for the things to come. Also, the Unspoken Plan Guarantee trope does exist for a reason, cliché or not. Still, my ambition is to be better and more twisty about this in the future. As for that not being what Sakura would have done, I'm not so sure - it was the best thing I could come up with that would actually have a chance of succeeding when I gave myself thirty minutes, and it displayed several of her strengths very well, I thought. The way the plan was carried out and presented was a little sloppy, though, I agree - that's on the list of editing stuff to do, too.

/However/, I'm not sure what to think about the amount of exposition that you seem to want. I agree that many of these questions are very interesting, and indeed a lot of them will see answers later as I get time and space to expand on them. The ones that are not necessary for the plot to work and that I can't sneak in somewhere, however, will necessarily be relegated to the info blurbs, where people who aren't interested can skip them.

As an example: I'm a computer programmer by profession, and I actually did sit down and take the time to think of a system for how seals work in general, though not in enough detail to be able to, say, give an exact part-by-part description of the inner workings of Sakura's exploding scrolls (yet, at least!). This seal system is, however, generally complicated, and while the basics probably will be described in the story, if you want to get a little more in-depth, the blurbs are a better place for it. While gratuitous "techsposition" may appeal to some, not everybody wants to read about how Sakura sets the individual seal components up in this specific novel fashion to get this awesome result because this and this and then this, and there "it works, on these general principles" seems better.

At least, that's been my thoughts on that so far. I'm open to persuasion, and I'm certainly considering this aspect anew, anyway. I'm sorry for writing such a long reply. I swear, this always happens - practically by accident!

**** Haha, don't worry about the long reply, I like that you're taking the criticism so well. Which means I can afford to be more harsh, I suppose! (Bear in mind that I'm no great writer, so don't take anything I say for granted.)

EY is right that you need plot tension. Something has to make the story gripping for the audience. However, I don't like the whole "one month to beat Izanami" idea much because it feels so very Shonen. In fact, you need to decide (if you haven't already) what your story mainly is about, what the central message/theme is going to be that the story will work towards which gets resolved in the climax, and then make sure you introduce/foreshadow the central challenge as early as possible. It's like holding a speech: You start by saying what you will say, then you say it, then you say what you've said. You'll notice that you can predict the central plot of Naruto and HPMOR both from the first episode/chapter. Right now all I get from your first chapter is that Sakura will have a rivalry with Izanami and that she wants to make the world better. Pretty vague.

Also, right now your character writing could use some improvement, I think. I'm not saying it's bad, but your characters still feel a tad flat. I recommend the method of character writing where you put yourself in the shoes of each character and then have them act as if they were the protagonist of the story (like EY does). A cheap trick I know to make characters feel 3D is to establish a certain pattern of behavior for a character, and then have them break it by doing or saying something completely different. People surprise you in real life so your characters should, too. The part you wrote where Sakura came across a sulking Izanami is good because it leaves the reader to wonder what's going on in her head. As always, it's better to say less and show more.

I'm going to be frank about your combat descriptions: If you don't feel confident in your ability to make seal work interesting, why on earth did you make it your main character's main ability? There is a very good reason why Naruto's main ability is “shadow clones” and not “fire ball” in canon: The entire story is going to hinge on fights with that ability being interesting! You don't have to go in depth at this point, it makes perfect sense to reveal information bit by bit, but the audience needs to know the basics of what you can do with seals or else any solution involving seals will feel like a copout. You cannot, cannot write fight scenes where you go “and then Sakura did this clever thing and it worked” if you want it to appeal to a rationalist audience. Each challenge/fight/obstacle must feel like a puzzle that the audience can solve using the information it has. The alternative is the equivalent of a mystery novel where the critical information needed to solve the murder doesn't get revealed until after the criminal gets arrested.

One last thing: The most powerful aspect of rationality is not solving problems in a clever way (despite what people on Less Wrong seem to think), but allowing you to decide what you should be aiming for in the first place. Think about how some people spend 30 minutes on deciding what degree to get, and then 4+ years trying to finish said degree.* The point being that if you want Sakura to be a rationalist character and not just clever, some introspection on what she's doing and why would go a long way. (Why did I decide to be a ninja? Should I fight this guy? What are my chances of success? Maybe I should run? What do I want and how can I get it?). If a character waits with applying rationality until they're in the middle of a fight then they're not really rational. Is she even okay with killing people? Does she know? Food for thought, maybe.

*The main weakness of rationalists is that they spend forever on trying to decide what to do, and then they don't do anything (because humans can't consider things in a vacuum) --> akrasia.

***** Thank you for the blunt candor - I appreciate it, and if you've got more of it in the future, I do urge you to not hold back in consideration of my fragile ego. One of the best ways to get better at stuff is finding out what you're doing wrong, and then correcting that. A lot of what I do is me operating on pure intuition, and a lot of this feedback really helps make things much more explicit so I can /learn/ things, which is, to me, a large part of the entire point of writing this story - it's extremely valuable to me!

I carry around with me at all times a small bag of my favorite candy, of which I will only partake when I just did something like realizing an error I made and corrected on that (and will also try to think positive thoughts and feel nice about it). I get another feel-good reward cookie if I discover further good reason to believe that I indeed corrected successfully (for example, a later review states that now it's much better, and I agree). I note that, generally, I don't eat a lot of candy at all (it's expensive in Denmark).

As a strategy, I've found it works... fairly well, though it's no miracle cure. At least my own impression is that it mostly weans me off reacting negatively when people tell me I'm wrong, or have made errors.

*Mild story meta-spoilers ahead.*

On the topic of plot tension: much like EY, I've plotted the story along episodic arcs which are largely self-contained mini stories. As the introductory arc (ending with next chapter), the Spark arc is more aimed towards introduction and setting-up than later arcs will be - tension is going to ratchet up sharply in the very near future.

Granted, if I rewrote the first arc entirely I would probably do it very differently, given the perspective I've gotten since I wrote it almost half a year ago. I may even do that, eventually. That being said, given the arc's purpose and how it's meant to fit in, it's hard to change it for more "main plot tension". Maybe not impossible, but difficult without major changes to the entire story structure. I'm moving on for now though, as I think, while it's by no means a perfect introductory arc, at least it does its job... passably. I /think/.

I do think I can make the seal-work interesting, /and/ make it work in combat - maybe you misunderstood what I meant with the basics. There is a grounding in the basic principles coming, bit by bit, when it fits in, so people can understand what's going on and so Sakura's seals aren't just a bunch of black boxes - I don't intend to generally do the "oh, this works because I say it does" thing. However, the way you put it raises it to a more conscious level of consideration that it hadn't been at before, so thank you for that - I'll try keep it more firmly in mind now.

I originally hesitated to call the story explicitly rational, and maybe I still should. I've mentioned before that it's mostly /later/ in the story that a label like "rationalfic" could more justifiably be applied. So far it's mostly a classic take on a "rational" universe (another way of saying it tries to make sense and be realistic) with the effort of trying to write it well narratively, and that's it; the characters we've seen are certainly not explicit rationalists of any kind. For example, Sakura is clever, yes, but she is /not/ a typical rational protagonist right now, and I don't mean for her to be. I don't want to spoil too much, but be realistic - how many of us truly know exactly what we want to do when we're fifteen years old, and why we want to do that?

You say you want to see how people arrive at their powers (and you seem to count things like rationality as powers) - well... there you are. Sakura is simply a somewhat bright fifteen-year old girl. She doesn't herself know the answers to all of those questions, nor even that she should be asking them, for the most part. My story consists of three planned volumes, all of them fairly long, and this is simply the first. There's a long way to go yet. In fact, while I haven't exactly considered this perspective, you might say that what I'm really writing right now is in fact the prequel to volumes two and three. And I do know where I'm going - I knew what the ending was going to be before I wrote the first word of chapter one. In fact, I wrote some of the ending as the very first thing I did at all. The entire story is plotted on an arc-by-arc basis, so far, letting me shift things around as I need without compromising the larger picture.

As for my characters being flat, that's... disturbing to hear, and a very serious problem if it's true. I already do the thing with putting myself in the shoes of the characters, in fact. Can you elaborate a bit more on this issue? If you mean Sakura, I could be in deep trouble. If you mean Naruto, Izanami or Kakashi, the only thing I can say is that I haven't had the time to dig into the characters yet, but that it certainly is... coming. If you mean anyone else, then I'm much less worried.

Again, thank you very much for the feedback.

****** You're right, I did implicitly assume that you were writing a rationalist fic due to the sections on chakra and science. It seemed to imply that the story was going to gradually evolve towards solving the science behind chakra, with Sakura leading the way HJPEV-style. If that's not your intention then explaining the logic behind the techniques is much less important, as long as we know what they do. However, I still don't like the part where "Sakura is so smart she invented a brilliant Anbu-technique all on her own" without explaining the thing that she actually did. It sounds like an informed ability this way.

Don't take my bit on characters being flat too seriously: I did mean only a little bit flat. It's mostly Naruto and Izanami who seem like they need some more depth, though that could just be because it's still early in the story. Sakura's narration implies a good deal of character but there simply isn't much we know about her. She has invisible parents who apparently don't want her to be a ninja but we don't know why; she wants to be a ninja but we don't know why; she wants to improve the world but we don't know why. In each of those points in the story you had a great opportunity to reveal a bit about her background, but you chose not to.

Speaking of which, every passage you write is supposed to have a point. Ask yourself: Why is this scene in my story and what would the story lose if I cut it out? If you're not going to reveal any new information in the whole "tell us about yourselves" segment, why does it need to be in your story? In canon Naruto, most of the main plot was revealed in that scene. You lost a great opportunity to do some foreshadowing of your own there. Or you could have replaced it with something else entirely.

As for Sakura's motivation...does a character need a reason to want to help people? Many people are raised in such a way as to naturally have an impulse of kindness. Sakura's will is probably extremely strong.

It would be nice to know more about why she chose to be a ninja, but I imagine it has something to do with taking advantage of Ninjutsu to further her other goals.

The actual canon rules are:

2. No medic ninja shall ever stand on the front lines.

3. No medic ninja shall ever die until they are the last of their platoon.

The trick is then to wheels-in-wheels it by having the you in the illusion then 'use' the technique halfway through the speech, so that you can see what kind of counter they might have to it after you alert them to it.

**** I'd thought (though I'm not sure how this fits in with your story's model of chakra working) that it worked by releasing chakra in a way analogous to creating a highly-compressed gas under one's feet, and as the chakra "expands" it pushes the user, or she releases the chakra in a continuous "jet" to power the jump. (Though if this is the case, Naruto should probably be able to fly once someone points it out to him, especially if he has wind-natured chakra.)

Alternatively, perhaps what feels like channelling a burst of chakra out of one's feet is actually sending a pulse down one's leg muscles in order to jump further, but I think that's a different technique.

** I went into this more thoroughly in the review I left, but I forgot to log in so it ended up as a guest review. You use semicolons too often and incorrectly. It shouldn't take too long to fix once you look up the grammar rules. It might seem unnecessary to fix minor grammar issues, but it can turn off some readers, though fanfic readers are generally more tolerant. Also, I when I first started reading your fic I was a bit turned off because the story starts in a really cliched way (the main character hurrying out of bed). This wouldn't have been an issue except that you focus a bit more than necessary on how Sakura hurries. It gets a bit redundant and tedious to read. Other than that I'm liking the way the story is going so I look forward to reading the rest.

*** I saw the review, but couldn't reply because it was a guest review. First of all, thanks for the review!

I know I have an issue with the semicolons, and I'm working on it. I'm actually currently looking for betas to resolve issues like that one, and some time before the next chapter goes back, I'm going to do a cursory editing back and resolve a lot of the minor issues that have been pointed out.

I've been made keenly aware that the beginning is horribly cliché and has a lot of problems, and I'm starting to regret having done it that way. At some point, I will probably change it to something entirely different. However, that isn't right now - I'd rather focus on writing ahead and keeping up a decent backlog than getting too bogged down in editing.

**** Yeah, I agree it's nothing major. Just something to keep in mind for the future.

**** One thing I do is keep a google doc called "2YE fixes" for The Two Year Emperor. Periodically I go back and read a chapter when the mood strikes; I note down any errors that I spot and don't worry about it. Eventually, when I have the tuits, I sweep through and fix all the issues. It's working pretty well for me so far.
