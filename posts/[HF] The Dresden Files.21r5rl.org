I'm honestly surprised this series hasn't been mentioned, considering it's one of the strongest Urban Fantasy series currently in the work.

The magic systems involved are very rule-based, to the point where the magic system works as a tabletop RPG with minimal editing.

There are about half a dozen major factions in the story, of varying levels of power and malevolence. One great thing I love about the series is the factions are often seen interacting, rather than being invisible when they're not part of the current conflict.

Also, there's a zombie T-rex.


** It's good stuff overall, but not particularly rationalist in any way in my opinion. Even though there is a lot of detective work etc., it's very rare for there to be much ability to predict motive or means or character before it is resolved in-story. Also, there are a lot of very explicitly good and evil factions in the story (e.g. literally God and angels represented by the Knights of the Cross, against literal fall angels trying to tempt and persuade the righteous into sin).

The rules-based magic could be argued - I personally found a bunch of things and situations felt like cop-outs or deus-ex-machina when they occured, and it never felt like Butcher's characters had very closely defined limits and capabilities.

Overall, very good books - though the first couple are noticeably rougher than later entries. I look forward to the release of Skin Game in May.

Jim Butcher's Codex Alera books were better about foreshadowing magic, but were substantially less complicated and interesting, being as they are essentially generic fantasy bildungsromans. It lacks the style and writing that makes the Dresden Files stand out from the crowd of urban fantasy. The antagonists were partially interesting and partially not - /rot-13 spoilers/ gur glenavq/mret/krabzbecu fgnaqvaf jrer obevatyl rivy ohg unir gur zbfg obbx gvzr/birenepuvat cybg qribgrq gb gurz, juvyr gur bgure nagntbavfgf ner zhpu zber vagrerfgvat. /end rot-13 spoilers/. The protagonist's faction tends towards extremely boring.

If you want something similar in tone and writing style but in a more high fantasy setting, I'd check out Steven Brust's Jhereg books (read in order of publication). The first one has a few rough spots but there's a lot of good stuff in the series as a whole. Not particularly rationalist in any outstanding way, but still a good read (much as I consider the Dresden Files).

Pretty much this. I've only read the first four books and every. single. fight. goes the same way: Dresden and the enemy keep casting spells or exchanging physical attacks for pages, they're all dodged, and then Dresden gets some non-life-threatening injury and pulls some solution out of nowhere to win when all seems lost.

I pretty much had to force myself to read them instead of just skipping to the next line of dialogue (which is arguably the best part of Dresden Files), because I got no entertainment or enjoyment from them whatsoever.

** I like the Dresden Files. They're in a weird middle ground where they're too rational-ish to be amenable to a rationalfic, but still not up to a standard of rationality.

*** Yeah, it might not be the hardest rational fiction, but the big difference between it and most other fantasy, is that it's obvious the author is trying to be rational and consistent in worldbuilding and storytelling.

As a counterexample, J.K. Rowling never even tried. Potter never tried to steer the plot in a way that benefited himself, with maybe one or two exceptions in the entire series. Forming the underground fight club is the closest thing that comes to mind.
