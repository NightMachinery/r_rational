** (Mild Puella Magi Madoka Magica spoilers, probably not enough for a tag)

Crack hypothesis: the world of Glimwarden is the nth incarnation of the PMMMverse. The seeming Big Bad is in truth Akemi Homura, who hunts darklings with her time stopping powers and collects grief seeds, seeking to prevent Melanie from making a contract (also known as a /bind/ing agreement) in exchange for magical girl powers, as well as defeating a seemingly invincible monster that regularly attacks civilizations. And only Homura knows a dark secret about the nature and origin of their magic.

Starring: Merry as Mami, a veteran magical girl with tons of guns. Sanders is Sayaka, the main character's best friend. Chloe is Kyouko, a mysterious magical girl from out of town who likes food. And Philip is Alexander Wales' self insert.

Thoughts? Prizes for figuring out Wales' game before the big reveal?

** Good chapter. Definitely intrigued by the Dark Warden. Dim Warden? Dimwarden.

Sander's description of his powers can probably stand to be cut down and made more simple/obvious. Maybe a very brief example with simple numbers would help.

Also, Melanie's reaction to seeing Farrell was a bit too "telly."

#+begin_quote
  Melanie could tell that there was something *dangerous* about Farrell though, an *unpleasant* intensity that was looking for a target. He was, to all appearances, their leader. The truth was, there were too many things happening in Light's Hollow, and they were happening all at once. A lantern failure, an influx of immigrants, talk of expansion, and all of the usual things that always went on. The town had troubles in the past, but they came one at a time, which allowed for time to adjust and recover. She couldn't shake the *terrible* feeling that *something bad* was going to come of all of this.
#+end_quote

Maybe it's just me, but I think one of those would have been sufficient to get the point across, whereas all four made her feel a bit too intuitive, or Farrell a bit too obviously evil, for someone she was just observing from across a crowd. Unless this is all meant to be setup for a twist and he's not actually evil at all, forshadowed by the misunderstood Lucian.

Not just observing from across the crowd, she heard his speech. I had "danger: fanatic" warning flashing since the first sentence of it. I mean, nominally he advocates tolerance, but from the tone it's quite clear that he doesn't /really/ mean it. He appears either a fanatic with enough reason to bear with heretics while he needs them (despising them all the same), or a cynical type of priest who doesn't believe his own religion and just uses it to gain power.

**** Agreed, he's almost certainly a bad guy. That paragraph just felt like I was being hit over the head with it. I don't mind her having a bad feeling, or thinking he's up to no good, I just found it a bit too repetitive. To have that strong a feeling about someone you've barely met is pretty rare. Unless it's intentional for emphasis to set up a twist and he's actually good.

*** I don't think he can keep distance and escape velocity and change time: he chooses two and the third is fully determined by 'Speed vector = distance/time'. Of course he can change his escape velocity by using an initial velocity like he did in the chapter, so maybe that's what you mean?

** When Sander teleports, does he arrive facing in the direction of his travel, or the direction he was facing when he teleports? Presumably it's the former, since arriving at the speed of a full sprint while facing backwards would cause him to fall, and he only slightly stumbled (with Melanie on his back no less). So if the teleportation turns his body to face the direction of travel, does this add rotational velocity to him and could he use this in his sword fighting? It would be useful at close or long range to add power to his swings.

*** Velocity equals distance divided by time. Sander's power allows him to choose his end point (which, along with his current position, determines the distance and direction) and how long it is going to take for him to appear there (the time). Divide distance by time and you've got his velocity upon arrival, plus the direction as if he had run in a straight line towards his destination.

Since he wanted to cross a lot of space in a short time, but also did not want to die from arriving at his destination so fast that he splatters against a wall, he had to figure a way around that.

What he figured, is that the velocity he gains in his teleportation is added to his current one. So, by running in the opposite direction, the velocity he gained was subtracted from that of his running, so he arrived at a more survivable speed at his destination.

***** With the flying he had both a completely empty space where he could go at high speed without the risk of crashing into something, plus the knowledge that gravity would slow him down and pull him back down, at which point he just had to teleport slightly up to counter his falling momentum and repeat until he was back on the ground.

I imagine in a crowded town, even a series of shorter teleports in the direction he wanted might have ended with him bumping at high speed into someone or something. Plus, we don't know if several short teleports cost more bind then one long covering the same distance (my guess would be yes).

I suppose he could have teleported up, then sideways toward his destination (but not completely there), then fallen in small chunks of parabolic arcs, teleporting up and in the opposite direction in such a way to kill his horizontal momentum at the right spot, then return to the ground like he did with the flying trick before, but the math necessary to get to the right spot and not kill both himself and Melanie might have been to much even for him, not to mention the question I pointed above on whether he would have enough bind to do all that.
