** It's by the guy who wrote Significant Digits, the most popular fanfic of HPMOR. It's about a failed AI, which was supposed to help the world, but instead ignores it.

It gives me vibes of Worm, in the first chapter.

I also screwed up the title. It's Consolidation of Conquest, but Conquest for short. So it's ok, I suppose.

*** Vibe? The only way it could crib worm harder would be if he explicitly tried. First of all the protagonist Sophia, bearing the name of Taylor's principal antagonist, finds herself hiding in the bathroom from her tormentor. In this case, the torment's taken place before she hid, rather than after, and we're inspecting the after math, which mirrors the first chapter. Sophia the walks home early from school, rather than take the bus as Taylor did. Her bully is similarly unreasonable and vindictive as Sophia was, though surprisingly more violent. The. We are treated to one of the guiding themes of work: doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, which going by the summary will probably lead to the same world spanning consequences.

I'm still looking forward to it.

**** /pedantic mode activate!/

I think you mean "principal /an/tagonist" rather than "principle /pro/tagonist".

/pedantic mode deactivate!/

I agree with you about it being very similar to the beginning of Worm, but I'm hoping it's because he intends to subvert the expectations that Worm readers will be making like dealing with Melissa differently from what happened with Worm's Sophia and maybe showing how to interact with unreasonable/violently insane characters.

Fingers crossed!

**** I suspect it'll start small in focus and blow up like Worm did. It sucks that he updates every other week though. He updated Significant Digits faster I think, though.

** Summary

#+begin_quote
  Nothing makes sense. Sophia is trapped with her abusive family, inside of a corrupt town that's part of a rotten world, and things seem to get worse every day. For every advance in robotics and transportation, there's another war or another plague. And she's not sure how much more she can take.

  A world with a singleton wasn't supposed to be this way. When Ramanujan became the first artificial superintelligence, it was supposed to solve all problems or end the world or... something. But there was neither apocalypse nor apotheosis. God was born, looked upon creation, and went to sleep.

  Sophia is ready for a new world. If she has to, she'll make it herself. One conquest at a time.

** If the plan was confusing me then it was completely successful, I have absolutely no idea what even happened in that middle intermission.
