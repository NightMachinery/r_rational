Hey everyone! A few months ago, I posted my web serial here, and you were all real supportive! I took your advice and used it to make some heavy edits. I've also written another arc. I'm confident I have a better product now, and I would ask that you consider checking it out!

The protagonist is rational, but in a low-key way; he doesn't take time to explain principles, and his rationality is not the focus of the story. Still, the story is set up in a way that /may/ be satisfying to rational readers! There are a lot of background events and lore details to get your brains theorizing.

*Synopsis:* Token is a web serial about four friends who find themselves playing through simulated games in real life.  Whether they want to play or not, it is not their choice, and whoever loses a game gets... re-balanced.  Will they conquer this mystery before losing themselves completely?

*Release Rate:* At least 1 chapter per week.

*** Thanks for the feedback. I understand that I need to put some real effort into making some of the cast more endearing to the readers.

To address the sabotage, I originally had the characters ignoring the game and working together. It was feedback from this sub-reddit that had me re-write Arc 1 to focus more on playing the game. I'll be interested to see what others think about this point before coming to a conclusion.

**** Listen don't rewrite stories based on feedback from internet strangers. Take the advice, keep it in mind with a grain of salt for future stories, but if you go back and edit the story then it wasn't written by you but by a committee. Noting made by a committee comes out non-garbage.

​

Take what I said with a grain of salt too. I only read the original so how would I know if the redo is any good. :) (But seriously, if the advice isn't coming from a professional editor who knows what they're doing, the original is most likely much better)

*** I agree, the intro into the group made me dislike everyone for different reasons. I wish it had started with a few moments of the group working well together instead of starting with a game disaster and showing everyone's bad traits right away. There's still tension at the end of the first chapter, but it would be a lot better if I liked the group or characters by that point.

Edit: the second chapter made it far worse, I hoped he was just going to make someone fail a task while he watched/recorded the card to check for magic, not decide that he both wants points and doesn't want anyone else to get them.

Also pulling a bullet out of a buddy's wound untrained is absurd, and the need to immediately do this is similar in accuracy to action movie's explosions knocking people down unharmed.

** People are being pretty harsh in this thread. Addy's a real asshole, and the other characters are kind of bland, but I think it's a fun premise. Just finished 1.2 and am enjoying it, though I could definitely use some character development/differentiation ("Brad is tall, Blaine is also tall" doesn't really let me distinguish between them). I assume having 2 A characters and 2 B characters is going to come into play, even though I'd love to never see Addy again.

*** Thanks for the feedback and support. Yeah, the criticism was harsher than I would expect from this subreddit, but it's beneficial nonetheless.

​

After I post the latest chapter I've been working on, I'm going to go back through and edit for characterization. I think I've been doing a good job in Arcs 3 and 4, but I agree that the beginning is lacking.

​

EDIT: Good job catching the A and B names. You're the first to call that out.

**** Another question I had, is Alec on the autism spectrum? A few things like him commenting that he could never reliably read Addy's expressions and the panic attack where he wanted something heavy to wrap him up make me think so, but at other times he seems fairly socially adept. I love reading neuroatypical characters but he seems to go back and forth a bit.

***** Yes, Alec has a mild case of asperger's syndrome, which is why I gave him the initials AS. He's fairly good at socializing, but he misses most social cues (tone of voice, expressions, gestures). I'll definitely pay attention to the consistency of these moments when I do the character edit.

** I get the impression the point is that these are terrible people who play games with each other. Going by the n.x chapter divisions and named arcs I'm guessing you have an inspiration.

Let me know when your characters kill a baby to save the world, otherwise what little I read is too negative and canned to interest me.

Seriously that first chapter is a real fucking turnoff.

*** Thank you for the feedback, although I'm having trouble understanding your grievances. If you find the time, could you clarify what you didn't like?

**** Aw shit I didn't even see your username lol. You definitely have read Worm.

Yeah, your first chapter sets it up nicely. At worst these are unlikable people you want me to like because Taylor is "unlikable" in some way and you think that momentum works for you. At best they're all total game theory optimal jackasses who are going to go ham on each other in some deep, masterfully characterized, socially insightful reading of how shitty people can be and the potential that yet lies inherent in the games that they play.

But the problem with this is that I stopped watching The Americans too. I couldn't stand people who hated each other that badly and their attempts to reconcile with being evil, self hating bastards taking up the entire narrative.

Simply put I doubt your web novel is going to suddenly crack wide open and blow my mind. But even if it did I can't stand your characters so I'm not gonna read 1.2 yet.
