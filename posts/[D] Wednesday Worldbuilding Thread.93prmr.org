Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** There was an interesting post to [[/r/worldbuilding]] a few days ago, which was a list compiled by an anthropologist of "universal" elements of human cultures. [[http://willsull.net/resources/HumanUniversals.pdf][Link here [PDF]]]. I'm not entirely sure how /correct/ it actually is, but the list provides an interesting starting point for making non-human cultures, since you can strip out some "universal" thing as a way of making a non-human culture distinct from a human one.

(The question of /why/ these might be universal to different human cultures is beyond the scope of that list, but it's also a fun thing to think about.)

** I've been trying to build a world for a DnD campaign and a problem I keep running into is what exactly to do with the Gods

Like, what exactly do they /do/ on a day-to-day basis? Why do they intervene in the world, but only in weird, specific, inefficient ways? Why are Clerics even a /thing/? Some Gods hate other Gods, but for some reason they resolve these conflicts by making mortals fight other mortals on the material plane?

I'm sure there are answers to these questions, but I can't think of any that preserve that "heroic holy warrior" feel that Clerics and Paladins are meant to have and/or avoid making the entire setting /about/ them. I'm not really interested in a deconstruction of the concept, just an explanation or a justification or something so I can get on with the rest of the setting

*** - Gods are constrained by what they can do in some kind of Mutually Assured Destruction scenario. Directly using godly power to reshape the world would result in a cataclysm of countermoves which doesn't benefit anyone. Imbuing power into clerics and paladins is permissible in a way that directly using the finger of godly power is not.

- Gods work on incentives that maximize their actual power when used in weird, specific, and (seemingly) inefficient ways. If you're trying to get around the weird game mechanical implications of D&D like "more experienced clerics get more power" or "clerics only draw from a specific spell list" or "clerics only cast a certain number of spells each day", you can answer those questions with background rules which (more or less) map to the actual rules. Maybe spell levels are /actually a thing/ that clerics discuss amongst themselves, and which relate directly to their abilities. They wouldn't necessarily call these spell levels, but "third heightening of the second aspect" or similar, which would reflect the reality of the clerical spellcasting system. As for why spells are the way they are, it might be the case that "pre-packaged" or "off-the-shelf" spells are substantially cheaper to power than custom-made ones (with obvious parallels to the real world).

- Gods need champions not just as a power multiplier, but because they need their power and influence to spread in the world, and a god can only be in so many places at once. You wouldn't expect a god to show up to solve any particular problem anymore than you'd expect a CEO to be handling customer complaints. There are some problems with this, namely that there /are/ situations that would seem like they'd merit the CEO showing up, but we can maybe patch that by depicting the gods as perpetually locked in a balanced struggle, with the actions of mortals being an effort to tip the scales one way or another, and all mortal struggles being essentially incremental plays for a better position in the eternal battle.

*** One explanation that The Gods are Bastards gives is that gods are less super-powerful humans, and more "fields" or "forces" that occasionally manifest as conscious entities, but more often behave mechanistically and as a diffuse unconsciousness

Only specific foci or events can draw the attention of a god to force it to manifest, and the manifestation --- the physical appearance, behavior, agency and personality of the manifested projection differs with the scenario. For example, a god called upon to address an audience will be more grandstanding and forceful, a towering figure radiating with divine light, speaking with a thundering voice and declarative mode of speech. Meanwhile, a god called upon to give counsel to the high priest of its faith may be more humble and look like an ordinary person, speaking softly and with greater compassion.

In essence, gods are not beings in this mythology---they are complex forces of nature that manifest in a number of manners, including but not limited to as a conscious individual, and even then in a number of manners. They don't do anything in their off-time, since "off-time" isn't a concept that applies to something that is only conscious when there is specific work to be done. They intervene in weird, specific ways because they only gain the capacity of free will and action in said weird, specific contexts.

We could separate divine wielders/characters into ones that commune with the sentient aspects of the gods, and those that interact with the diffuse, mechanistic aspects, or "god fields". One might say that priests and priestesses are the former, while clerics and paladins* are the latter. This would justify clerics and paladins not really being that big of a deal, since gods probably don't even notice them most of the time. As long as they keep to the doctrine of the faith, they can manipulate the divine power that is hence automatically vested in them. Simultaneously, this safeguards the archetypical moral integrity and faithfulness of cleric and paladin characters---if they become evil (in the relevant god's book) or heretical (against the god's doctrine) then they lose their power^.

- Actually, in TGaB paladins are super important and incredibly powerful unique individuals, with their patron gods basically permanently keeping their eyes on them. But this is your setting, so that's not important.

^ One could create a "technically good" cleric/paladin antagonist that theoretically obeys their god's doctrine but uses rules lawyering to twist everything to their own benefit while harming others. TGaB has such a character, and it's an excellent way to subvert the traditional "holy and good" image without compromising the integrity of other divine-powered characters in the same setting.

  Like, what exactly do they do on a day-to-day basis?
#+end_quote

There are as many potential answers to this as there are stories about gods. In greek myths, the gods behaved much the same as humans did. They slept around, partied, celebrated, or worked. There's no reason Boccob, god of Magic, Knowledge, and Magical Knowledge couldn't be satisfied with a day spent researching the secrets of the universe or organizing his library.

#+begin_quote
  Why do they intervene in the world, but only in weird, specific, inefficient ways?
#+end_quote

Why can a Wizard only conjure fire in a particular set of shapes? Why isn't there a half-squirrel half-alligator monster? Many rules can be broken, but there are some rules that cannot.

Alternatively, the limits put on the gods are a peace treaty of sorts. Unleashing the fullness of their divine might in the mortal world would destroy it, or at least destroy their potential worshipers. Therefore, they've agreed to a set of limitations on their potential behaviors. The specific shape of these limitations is a result of the balance of power when the gods agreed to them.

#+begin_quote
  Why are Clerics even a thing?
#+end_quote

Clerics exist because they're cost efficient. Gods don't generate divine power, they merely manipulate it (in the same way that necromancers manipulate necromantic power). Empowering a Cleric is as simple as providing a mortal with a connection to this power source, and once that connection exists developing it no more requires further investment from the god who formed it than a Sorcerer honing her power requires her to discover greater levels of draconic heritage. This is also why it's possible to have heresy in a world where the gods exist and can be spoken to.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The gods are risk-averse. The world as it is contains some things that are pleasing to any particular god. There are things that are on fire. The God of Fire would like /more/ things to be on fire, and trying to kill the God of Water might facilitate that, but it also might result in the God of Water killing him, which would result in less things being on fire. As a result, the gods are content to engage in low-risk strategies like empowering Clerics or granting miracles.

** I'm currently working on what I /hope/ will be a rational story dealing with telepathic alien dragons, so the lore has to be pretty huge. The 'deep' lore is below (I'm much more worried about fleshing out the more recent lore, not pictured). Could anyone critique it, tell me if it makes sense, or if it's too cliche, etc?

--------------

The Local Group is populated by numerous sapient races, and FTL exists, but the spread of eukaryotic life is explicitly slow. Life has been jumping from star to star for billions of years, the most common organisms being a kind of space-tardigrade that researchers on earth have never even witnessed.

FTL works based on a sort of gate principle: once both entrance and exit are built, travel/communication is possible, but frontiers must be reached using slower-than-light. Thankfully, sentient life has existed a long time. Most of the Local Group is connected to a network.

Sapient races have a life cycle just as individuals do, going into decline after some amount of time. AI is not a threat for this reason: too much intelligence -> decline.

The star network is maintained by a loose alliance of active races. Most are bizarre and have inexplicable goals, but some are humanesque. This alliance has lasted a long time, and there were numerous similar alliances before it, each with the same goals: spread life, expand the network, and maintain the gates.

It is tradition among alliance members to uplift other races in a way that is similar to parenting: each race hopes its successors will improve upon it and live longer than it. Humans are the child race of what we call dragons, reptilian quadrupeds. The prevalence of dragons across all human cultures comes from interactions with them long ago.

Until relatively recently, most species never dabbled with telepathy because it always resulted in hiveminds, but a few generations ago a sentient race arose that had a peculiar symbiosis with a sort of life form that took advantage of hyperspace to provide instantaneous telepathy. The life form creates a sort of black box in hyperspace that functions as a translator, allowing for hivemind-free (read: defense always trumps offense) telepathy. Most like-minded species were later designed with telepathy in mind, including dragons and humans.

The new hyperspatial life form inspired the design of similarly working technology, creating a telepathic interface for what would best be called “magic.” Earth was discovered when magic use was becoming wildly popular, and dragons intended for their children to be the first race to evolve with magic from the start. Unfortunately, in ~100,000 BC, it was discovered that magic use had a negative correlation with the nearby spread and evolution of life (it kills space tardigrades). Since spreading of life is goal #1, magic was almost immediately shut down universally, sans telepathy, which was only grandfathered as most races could no longer function without it. Earth was taken from dragon control after they fought to keep magic/telepathy running.

In the 21st century, humans are long overdue for contact, but the alliance insists they are dangerous for some reason, prompting some dragons to take action.

*** My first thoughts as I read it:

- space tardigrades is in the new Star Trek series and they are used for FTL travel with a "network". You might want to choose another type of creature: maybe some sort of archaea? Maybe a mitochondrion, and then you get the cool lore that humanity has aliens in its very DNA / panspermia? Or keep the tardigrades, just wanted you to be aware.

- "Sapient races have a life cycle just as individuals do, going into decline after some amount of time" - you need justification for this as it hits my suspension of disbelief HARD. Personally I'd ditch it and instead say that Beserkers kill off races that get too advanced if you really want to do that

- "The prevalence of dragons across all human cultures" - I contest that: does the Middle East have dragon mythos? What about the ~200 Australian Aboriginal culture groups? The innumerable African traditions? Did the Maya have a dragon myth? If you're counting "flying gods" or "reptile gods" as dragons, you are going to hit suspension of disbelief for honestly no good reason. You could, for example, limit historical dragon interaction to Europe and China - but European dragons and Chinese dragons look completely different and have different backgrounds (European dragons are evil, Chinese dragons are good).

- "most species never dabbled with telepathy because it always resulted in hiveminds" how?

- "a sort of life form that took advantage of hyperspace to provide instantaneous telepathy" how? are we talking basically a hyperspace babel fish because that's what i'm picturing?

- I don't understand at all how the introduction of hyperspace into the process allows for hivemind-free telepathy.

- "magic use had a negative correlation with the nearby spread and evolution of life (it kills space tardigrades)" - how? if magic is so commonly used by the dragons, why are they allowed to travel at all - shouldn't their space tardigrades be dead too? Why did human magic use have an effect and not the telepathy that other races used for so long that they can't function without it?

- "dangerous for some reason" - why? Is it because the magic still extant on Earth has killed all our local tardigrades and if we spread the tardigrades will all die?

Sorry to kind of tear everything apart - but hopefully it gives you a lot to think about. All in all, it seems like a cross between Startreck: Discovery, Stargate, and probably the Pern series (I haven't read the latter but "space dragons" sounds very much like it).

**** Thank you for the response! Some of the points you made look like I was just bad at explaining or skipped details due to brevity, but most are things I need to think through.

- The initial idea /was/ mitochondria, but I needed them to be slower than light, and it makes sense for something like tardigrade shells to survive in space. One of my fears was that mitochondria were too close to midichlorians, but I didn't realize tardigrades were already used by Star Trek! Just to clarify, they aren't used for FTL travel at all in this story; they just exist.

- Declines are super hand-wavey as is, so if you can think of a good explanation for them, I'm all ears. The way I imagined it was that each civilization might decline due to its own causes, but after /very/ long periods of time the trend just emerges without much further explanation. They would be purely cultural processes, where species don't exactly die, but lose interest in the galactic scene and whatever might have been their initial goals. Perhaps immortality itself would suffice, but then the question would be why doesn't it happen earlier. Immortality+endlessly progressing culture to its logical extreme seems like the most reasonable explanation to me at the moment.

- This is a good point that I didn't really consider. Either my alternate-earth would have a different history where other cultures also had dragons, or maybe dragons only landed in Eurasia (with a more recent timeline). I'm honestly on the fence between making dragons look like any mythological dragons or making them a bit more alien. I didn't talk much about them in this post because I'm still hammering that down and there's a lot to talk about. One huge difference between these and I think most mythological dragons is that these are quite small, at maybe 2/3 the size of a Komodo dragon. I also don't know whether they'll have wings, but if they do I imagine they'll have to be even smaller (even still, the strongest dragon could never fly in earth's atmosphere/gravity).

- Let me rewrite that: all previous attempts at telepathy resulted in either: sloppy, consciously encoded information (akin to having to control a muscle to pulse morse code), or some kind of merging between two individuals, ranging from 'leaking' information all the way to the two individuals merging. The problem with the latter, in all cases, is that neither individual can feel or control where their self ends and another begins, and no individuals possess the skills to stop anyone else from retrieving their memories or controlling their bodies. I'm not opposed to hive minds existing in the setting, so for some species that might not be a problem.

- The life forms are just a babel fish, and I have some idea of how they work, but I need to think through their evolution to find something that makes sense. As is, they are a symbiotic microorganism that lives in colonies that mirror the hosts' brains. If person A already possesses one colony, they may infect person B via proximity, creating an AB colony, which begins small and weak but can grow with proximity/practice/time. It takes months to grow a colony good enough for simple language based communication. If person B forms a BC colony, its growth is entirely independent of AB. No AI in this universe is powerful enough to replicate their results. Right now my best explanation for the hyperspace part is that physical space doesn't have any medium with a high enough bandwidth that's accessible to microorganisms: 100 trillion of these organisms could encode your entire brain without taking up any physical space, and many more would be needed for the black-box translation step.

- When magic is outlawed, dragons only use telepathy like most other species. Neither the life forms nor artificial magic have a good 'energy' explanation as is, so that might be the key to making everything to do with hyperspace make sense. How does the following sound as a description of this world's hyperspace:

Hyperspace is a plane where distance has a varying level of meaning. There is a concept of 'depth', where the deeper you go, the less meaningful distance becomes. Random interactions between particles become asymptotically less likely, but exchanges between particles that have already interacted (I hesitate to say entangled) become easier. At a certain, finite depth, the universe appears to be 0 dimensional. Interactions between particles tend to be over a long period of time, even if the particles only interact briefly in our universe. For beginning a connection in both FTL travel and telepathy, physical proximity in the real universe is important. The only instance of anything seeming to interact with anything else without physically interacting first is the case of the dying tardigrades. One major problem with this system is: what is the entry barrier? Why doesn't every life form already abuse it?

- The problem with the last point, and many of the points, is something I hope to get to in the future: Humanity's information about ALL of this comes from a 2 day encounter, and is reported by a single, potentially unreliable individual. Obviously in these posts my goal is to flesh out the backstory, but I unintentionally presented it as 'this is the information people in the story get.'

Thank you again for your response! I have not seen/read Star Trek or the Pern series, but it would do well to be genre savvy!

***** You really should watch the new Star Trek series - at least the parts with the Tardigrades and the FTL network as they're the things it seems like your concept "copied" (the first 2-3 episodes I think covers most of it, but [[/r/scifi]] or [[/r/startrek]] would probably be able to tell you which episodes to watch). I think, unfortunately, a lot of your idea could be seen as derivative of that due to timing and content - though I don't know for certain because I don't 100% follow your concept as it's very complicated.

If I have time at work today I'll read through the post I'm replying to again and provide some more detailed feedback, but if I never get to it I wanted to make sure that I recommended Discovery to you. If you're not in the USA it's on Netflix.

****** Thanks for the suggestions! I'll definitely watch at least a few episodes.

The tl;dr that my original post should have been the constraints I'm working with, aka my backstory:

- A member of an alien species lives on earth in hiding for several years, not knowing it is an alien
- It looks like a reptile, but is mentally only about 3 standard deviations different from the average human
- It has telepathic powers that it has spread to the family that raised it and close friends
- It has a brief encounter with a member of its species and they are able to communicate some, that knowledge forming a fraction of my original post
- The other alien does not return when it said it would, prompting our alien to go public and spread the information it learned
- Earth is completely isolated from the rest of the universe: no ftl, no communication

The story itself will be much less hard sci-fi than the backstory; it's set a couple years later when most people have given up hope that contact with aliens will happen anytime soon; the primary point of interest being the spread of telepathy.
