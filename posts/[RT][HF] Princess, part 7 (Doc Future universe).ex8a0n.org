** Back, after a bout of writer's block. Flicker discovers a problem with wanting to learn details--sometimes you get them and they don't help...

*** Seems like all of the big events happening at once.

**** Yeah, there's a fairly general clustering effect that can happen in systems subject to continual small perturbations that I figured would apply to the final stable state of a worldline after a long timeloop duel. The only assumptions you really need are 1) It's easier for the timing of event B to change if you aren't trying to move it before A or after C and 2) at some intermediate state, one side could get a relative advantage by moving an event sooner or later. So you get clumps--and someone clever might look at them, raise an eyebrow, and say 'Huh. Looks like there might have been an Oracle duel here.' 8-)

***** I really enjoy these bits of causality shenanigans in the story, and they seem to be very well thought-out. Do you have any more background on those, beyond what is in the story at various points? I've followed the story over a long time and feel like you (and your characters) have a much more intuitive grasp about this than I have, probably due to reading things mostly piecemeal. I might just re-read the story at some point, but still, I think it'd be interesting :)

****** Yes, I touched on it in my Behind the Future essay series (which are now more than 5 years old 8-0) but I don't think I was posting to reddit yet. The one on how I constructed causality and time travel is [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/88821806006/behind-the-future-part-2-building-in-time-travel][here]].

Edit: For those who have read Fall already, or don't mind spoilers, the first 2 paragraphs of Doc and Stella's discussion in Chapter 29 of Fall (Endgame II), which sound like theoretical technobabble, are actually a fair description of what Journeyman has been struggling against, although some of Stella's later speculation is inaccurate.
