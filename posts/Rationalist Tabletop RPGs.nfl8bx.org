Anyone can take one of the big existing TTRPGs and tell rational stories with it, but I don't know of any that are specifically designed around "rationalist" characters. This is interesting to me for a few reasons.

- The progression fantasy / "munchkinry" aspect of ratfic seems to be based ultimately on TTRPGs and their video game successors. Take an established set of rules, figure out the loopholes, "win". But for actual published TTRPGs, at least depending on the group, doing this could be considered bad manners, ruining the story, damaging the experience for the other players who just want to have a good time with their PCs, etc. (Edit: This is perfectly reasonable, those games are specifically designed for you to not do this)

- TTRPGs are usually designed around meta concerns, such as the *balance* of the player options, that end up internally inconsistent for the setting, for the sake of fun. This is eminently reasonable, fun is good for selling games, but it does often leave me wanting a more purely simulationist experience, a bit less tropey and closer to reality.

- TTRPGs are a chance for fans of rational fiction to practice their own personal rationality skills in an active and quasi-realistic way. If designed and GMed carefully, it could even be practice for using these skills in real life, which is supposed to be part of the point of rational*ist* fiction in the first place.

What do you all think about this design space?

My current idea is a game in which the PCs must figure out the true nature of the world / magic as quickly and accurately as possible, before dark rationalist opponents figure out those same secrets and put them to horrific ends.

This would be set in a modern day Earth setting, with the sudden introduction of an internally consistent hard magic system as the catalyst to begin the drama.


** TTRPGs are, above almost all else, /abstractions./ You roll a d20 and add some modifiers to see whether you got above an opponent's AC because 1) this abstraction is easy to "feel" and calculate and 2) modifications to this basic formula allow for good feedback in terms of tactical choices e.g. "If I use this ability to lower my ability to hit, I'll increase damage, and the expected value of that is /x/, which makes it a better choice in this circumstance".

I think there's some fun to be had in taking these abstractions as /literally/ representing the world, which is what a fair number of litRPGs do, but it's typically not how the games are designed. The abstraction is flawed, and those flaws have implications for the world, but the conclusion (typically) should be that in terms of lore and characterization, the "real" world of the characters works differently from the abstracted representation of the gameplay.

In terms of how to deal with it in terms of fiction, I think there are strengths and weaknesses to any approach. The usual litRPG approach is to take the abstractions as being literally true, with all the inherent absurdity of that, and that's ... fine, if a little overdone at this point.

Another approach might be to reduce the abstraction until it's comically complicated and impossible for anyone to figure out anymore than the real world is, with some guidelines and ability to pin metrics on things, but complications with data gathering and strategy implementation that mean you're often relying on guesswork and there are unknowns when going into any scenario. If you're /just/ adding in a magic system, you can make it like computer programming or something, where every variable is known and everything comes out the same way every time (in other words, computer programming with good, solid, well-documented code), and that's a bit less jarring than applying the same to, say, sword-fighting.

If you're making an actual TTRPG and want to make it "more rational", I think you need to either constrain the magic (or whatever) to just a few people, figure out what about the system is diegetic and what's not, and/or pay attention to the social, economic, political, etc. impacts of either the system or whatever magic you're adding in.

If you have something like "create food and water", you need to think about what this does to agriculture, figure out who can cast it and how often, whether the population of casters is economical to increase, etc. Then you need to do that for every other "spell" or magic item or magical effect or monster. This is a lot of work, which is why people don't generally do it, especially when it's all probably just a backdrop to the actual adventures. Given sheer the amount of stuff in most TTRPG settings, there's probably too much to calculate and figure out, and at a certain point, you're just drawing attention to the problems by trying to solve them (an uncanny valley of worldbuilding).

*** Thank you for this detailed response.

I'm definitely not interested in the "literal abstractions" concept, nor so much the "make the game itself as complex as real-world physics" approach. I want to respond to that part of your post with the following: I'm thinking about this more from the direction of encouraging a particular style of *characters*.

If the concept of a D&D party can be traced back to the Fellowship of the Ring, I want to design for characters whose primary meta-influence might be the Manhattan Project. Very smart people who *have* to get the science and the engineering right before the "bad guys" (from the MP's perspective) can use the wild new power of nuclear physics to destroy America.

Nuclear physics works in a particular, consistent way in the real world, and people really did both figure it out and completely change the face of humanity by industrializing and militarizing that knowledge. The magic system I'm gunning for would be an attempt to portray a similar process:

Something new about reality is discovered --> it has implications that will change the world --> you have to figure it out and change the world /your way/ before someone else changes it in a way you don't like. Urgency, the necessity of the scientific method, related rational-adjacent themes like transhumanism and how easily everything could go wrong if we fuck it up this time.

I agree entirely with your last two paragraphs, which is why I'm interested in a "one big lie" set-up. The players can go into the setting with real knowledge of the real world, and that will help them navigate the fictional world. It /is/ the real world, just with a brand-new outside context problem. And crucially, because it's brand new, no one knows what the long-term implications of that problem will be. The game could even be described as the PCs attempting to dictate what those long-term implications will be themselves.

**** have you ever seen Mage the Awakening? it is one of the flavors of new World of Darkness, and it leans strongly in this direction (along with Demon, and some of the God-Machine stuff). basically the world you know is a thin sheet over something larger, and there are a few supernatural oligarchs that have already mostly figure out the rules of magic, and oppress everyone else. if you adjust the setting a little bit, you could run it from the dawn of magic instead of a later point where those oligarchs are established and instead compete with them to get there. the issue here is that a character's knowledge of these new magical rules of the world are abstracted away, so as a player you aren't really applying rationality to figure out more, you are just creatively applying your powers the the best of your ability, then spending xp to "learn more".

if you want a game where the players will use their real world knowledge to try to deduce how a magic system works, I am actually working on something along those lines that I am happy to share the idea - it is a pen and paper system that has a computer mediated system for handling physics-magic interactions. the players have access to a physics runtime, and can pass the spells they cast, with the system giving them results. right now that is often instant death. in its current form it is a lot like dwarf fortress: the simulation is complex enough to do cool things, but the interface is terrible. I'm currently stuck in the mud getting it to generate different types of magic systems and other fundamental stuff that will probably prevent me from releasing anything playable any time soon (if I ever do), but I am happy to share the idea with the hope that someone else can do better than I can.

***** Yeah, "spending XP to learn more" is definitely the exact opposite of what I'm trying to do. It isn't Awakening, but this project began as a mod on Mage: the Ascension, basically "what if the Technocracy was right?" Instead of the Traditions and the Technocracy being two sides of the same coin, the Technocrats are actually anti-mages. They don't have ridiculous superscience, their powers strip away human/mage influence to reveal the true, materialistic universe underneath. This is understandably terrifying to the Mages, explaining their endless conflicts, but overall it creates a lot more nuance in the setting, I think.

Anyway, back to the point, your program sounds like it will probably be a fantastic resource, and if you have a blog or anything with project updates, I would love to take a look!

I should mention, I'm not interested in designing an actual book for publication or anything, this is just a personal project. Ideally, it would only be possible to run it once per group, because once the players figure it out, the work is done. I'd have to design a new magic system for them to interact with. And it would be highly susceptible to spoilers from previous players.

****** I never got a chance to play old World of Darkness. by the time I was getting into White Wolf, they were all about the new World of Darkness and Exalted 2e, and that was all I could find in game stores. and then I did the old person thing and stopped picking up new systems.

My program, in its current form, is nigh unusable. the isn't really anywhere I post where you can read about it, mainly because there isn't too much that I'd be able to show. right now the most interesting part about it is the idea behind it. if I ever decide to stop developing it entirely, I will release the code, but it is all in Common Lisp, so even most programmers would probably not bother with it as a starting point. I don't really do blogs, or really any form of social media, but if I ever do get it into usable form, I will almost certainly be posting it here.

the original idea for it was actually based on an RPG that is designed for one-offs as a sort of party game rather than a serious RPG system. I can't remember the name of the game system, but the idea is that the GM learns this weird constructed magic language, and then the players cast their spells in real time by saying the words out loud. then, because most people aren't great with languages they have never seen before, things go horribly wrong and everyone laughs. I will probably release a version of my program when it can do at least that much. right now you can only enter your spells with a fiddly command line interface, and when you try to do anything with magic generally either nothing observable happens, you die instantly, or you die instantly and there is massive damage to the area around you. it's a neat idea, but the jury is still out on whether or not I will be able to make something fun out of it.

regarding the once per group issue - my program actually generates the low level rules that govern each magic system, so it would be possible to generate a new one for each game. you could also reuse a system if you want the players to start a game as more experienced mages. in fact, this feature is one of the major things slowing down development, but I am not willing to simplify it because, as you have mentioned, it would mean you can really only run it for a given group one time.

** my group ran something similar to this premise, but using the Pathfinder 1e system. the GM basically had our characters gradually becoming more aware of the rules of the system, eventually culminating in us penning a rather complete book of 'physics' (which just ended up being the pathfinder core rulebook). we also gradually learned in character about story tropes that would show up again and again, and learned to exploit them. we were building a small kingdom, but viziers kept showing up and would inevitably be treacherous, so we eventually created an automatic vizier mulching device that was triggered when anyone tried to sit on the throne (we never sat on it ourselves so it worked out). we also eventually realized that we were different from the NPCs, who had abbreviated rules, and also that we could name people, things, and places to give them more permanence and greater complexity.

the campaign reached its conclusion when we realized that the world was as it was because the gods thought it should be that way, and kept running into this antagonist that was literally brought into being by the gods belief (or fear?) that there should be this sort of antagonist. we eventually solved this problem by evacuating our kingdom to another plane, then finding some of the tools the gods use and using them to reformat the entire prime material plane, to which these gods were tied. no more gods, no more antagonist, and minimal NPC casualties.

as a campaign it was really well done, and I applaud the GM for the idea of rules as written taken to the extreme with rational consequences, but I don't imagine that the concept would function as a rule set instead of a one off campaign inside an existing ruleset. for example, in the game I mentioned above, our characters were the only real "people" in the world. everyone else were partially simulated NPCs, and the world around us was empty except where the gods filled things in ahead of us as we traveled. the GM could make the whole world rational and consistent with its own rules because it was such a small and limited world. as another poster has already stated, RPG systems are designed to moderate some of the ideas of stories and adventure into a form that a human is able to handle as the administrator, in order to allow the rest of the group to enjoy playing in that system. without some sort of augmented transhuman GM setup (which, at this point, you could conceivably create using AI assistants and other purpose built software) then you will keep running into this same limit. humans just aren't gods yet, not even small ones.

your idea about the players needing to figure out the rules of magic isn't fundamentally different to any other mystery where you force your players to actually do the work to solve the mystery. it's a good campaign idea. having rational elements in pen and paper games tends to work fine, but unless you overcome the limitations I mentioned before, it will always be a story that is run on top of an internally inconsistent abstraction that the player characters must remain ignorant of for everything to work out as a playable game.

*** Hmm. I think part of my point here is that I'm trying to make a game that is specifically about living in a materialist universe more-or-less identical to our own, except with one big lie.

The central question might be, what would /you/ (normal everyday human in the modern world) do if you suddenly had to face an outside context problem of global importance?

The fact that the lie is the sudden emergence of some sort of magic system is what makes it fun. It allows you to apply real-world problem solving techniques to a fantastical problem, because the fantastical problem follows strict, consistent rules like any other piece of a materialist universe.

** What stuck out in this question to me is "purely simulationist" and it sounds like a mostly "puzzle solving" style of gameplay, as opposed to something that would benefit from dice or standard progression systems. You explicitly aren't interested in "spend XP to learn more" and I would hazard a guess are uninterested in "roll dice to see if you can solve this puzzle".

It sounds like the design space you'd find interesting is closer to an escape room or the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective games than a TTRPG. The core game element is experimentation, problem solving, and application of skills.

There's a few things I don't think you need for this:

- Character sheets, progression systems, or dice. Unless you want to simulate combat somehow, or want to introduce inter-party conflict via conflicting values, I'm not sure these things help you focus your core gameplay concept.

There's a few things I DO think you need for this:

- A really really well thought out world, with either an answer prepared or a way of quickly and accurately determining the answer for every experiment players perform or questions players ask. This is going to take time. This is going to take playtesters to imagine things you didn't consider, or get stuck in ways you didn't imagine. This is going to take some method of getting hints so a fail state isn't frustrating and players don't hit dead ends.

- An openness with your players that what you have for them is a puzzle with a "right answer", and clarity about their objective and how they're expected to go about achieving it. Is your problem easy to visualize? Can you give your players tools to visualize it somehow? Decide to what extent you want simulated conflict or alternative win states and ensure that your players understand the constraints of the puzzle.

- A way to make this engaging. Do you have props or vivid descriptions? TTRPGS are engaging for many people because they can play characters with their own motivations and history, in a way that's owned. If the focus is on the puzzle, is the puzzle novel, easy to interact with, does it give good and clear feedback? Abstraction helps games model systems, but it also helps games stay engaging. If what you're asking your players to do is "undergraduate physics lab but on a novel magic system", you need to think critically about how you engage, excite, and interest them.

** The Worm RPG community that plays Weaverdice is fairly focused on a few play norms that I, an outsider, would describe as 'necessarily rational PCs.'

For example, your character didn't get to pick their powers, so you the player don't get to pick their powers. People don't have time to think in a brawl, so a dice roll can determine whether you struck brutally or weakly.

** The basic concept here is fertile ground for a lot of discussion, but I think the crux of your issue is that capital 'P' Puzzles are easily the least reliably entertaining aspect of TTRPGs. Your proposed idea leans so heavily on the idea of a larger Puzzle for the players to solve, it misses the opportunity to make use of the broader design space: An exploration of TTRPGs as exercises on game theory, for example.

I think it's a common experience among GMs that puzzles tend to reveal just how flimsy the veneer of "perfect communication" is in these games, and this realization is fairly destructive whenever it happens. TTRPGs are social games by nature, because they involve a group of people in constant communication (2 or more, usually 4 or 5, with the exception of solo games which are a different beast altogether). When we notice just how differently we interpret the fiction we're supposedly sharing, communication strains and sometimes breaks down.

I'd be much more interested in a self-aware game in which players and their characters consciously race to level up and achieve the necessary game mechanics to confront a threat or something like that. Maybe that's more rational than rationalist, though I think outside of written fiction the line between the two is blurrier.

*** I appreciate this comment! That is definitely not something I had considered, it's closer to the litRPG style, and that isn't my jam. I'm more interested in applications to real life and the real puzzles that people try to solve. Changing the materialist-universe puzzle from nuclear physics to something more internal and personal, like magic / superpowers, just makes it more interesting as fiction.

I'm sort of imagining the Manhattan Project, if instead of the A-bomb they were attempting to become master mages before the Axis could do the same, then /they personally/ traveled to Europe or Japan to fight magical battles with enemy mages.

If they managed to become more powerful mages than their enemies within their timeframe, they could use that to win the war. If they /failed/ to do that, they would have to rely on trickery and cleverness to get anything approaching a victory. Sort of a rolling failure state thing.

** A setting and system that already has something quite like this already is Unknown Armies, though usually it's run as a psychological horror game rather than this kind of tone. One of the stock plots for a high-powered party is an "ascension fight", where someone tries to game the rules of the universe to displace a (pseudo-)god.

How that works: There are (somewhat less than) 333 archetypes which are conceptual human identities, like the Mother, the Demagogue, the Messenger, the Athlete, which sit in the background and influence reality by controlling probability and (omnipresent, but very subtle and mostly not believed) magic. Humans can imitate an archetype and get magic powers reflecting its power if they imitate it closely enough; these are called Avatars. For each archetype, one Avatar is the 'godwalker', someone so close to the archetype that they can challenge it for dominance and supplant them. (In mechanical terms, they are the only Avatar in the world with an avatar skill of 99% - it's a D% system.) An ascension fight plot is when a cabal (party of PCs) try to arrange one of those challenges so that a member of their cabal first becomes the godwalker, displacing the existing one, then challenges and forces out the existing occupant of the archetype itself, thus achieving godlike power over the world.

They give an example of a Trickster avatar who is trying to ascend by mutating it to be the Hacker, and arranges a complicated series of digital traps securing an otherwise ramrod-straight and completely visible path from the entrance to their sanctum, thus fucking with the head of the Trickster, which expects misdirection.

** I think that there is a space for playing a game where your character munchkins the rules, figures out the loopholes, uses them to win.

Actually, I can think of two. The first is when everyone in the group is working together, munchkinning as a team, and the team /as a whole/ can win. This is how it can be done in a traditional tabletop game, and I note that there are other people responding with stories about that kind of game.

The second option is when the "campaign" is a single-player computer game. Think something along the lines of Neverwinter Nights - a computer scenario based around roleplaying rules. Here, you can munchkin without crushing the fun of the other players because the other players aren't there. (It gets quite a bit less applicable when using the multiplayer capabilities of the software).
