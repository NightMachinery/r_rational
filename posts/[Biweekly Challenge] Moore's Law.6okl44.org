This time, the challenge will be *Moore's Law*. Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years. It is widely considered to be a driving force in technological change. Similar observations have been made for things other than integrated circuits, such as quality adjusted price for IT equipment. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law#Other_formulations_and_similar_observations][See Wikipedia for more]]. Stories for this prompt do not necessarily need to be science fiction, though idealy fantasy parallels should be fairly clear. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 2nd.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be *Eschaton*. Basically, write a story about the ultimate fate of the world, whether that's its utopic, dystopic, weirdtopic, or apocalyptic. (Usually there is some divine element to an eschaton, but it's often used in other contexts, and can be freely dropped for the sake of this prompt.) Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/2.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6ol2n1/challenge_companion_moores_law/][is available here]].

*** Hm. The term 'caste' is telling--it sounds as though the preferred course of action would be to (use the last of their influence to) dissolve the caste system/boundaries (spreading literacy for one thing...), temporarily becoming a caste of warrior-mages or even just having most of their children train in other jobs.

Hmmm, now imagining a 'spearhead' for the Crown that was half as effective as the warrior caste in youth, then half as effective as the mage caste when elderly. With only mages, ones could use the older generation while the newer were weak, but you'd spread yourself too thin in trying to guard all the borders that unwhittled half-warriors could cover more easily. Granted, automatons ultimately spell the end of that in one form or another, depending on costs.

If the aim is to avoid warrior-obsolescence, rather than to migrate the genes and personal histories/culture of the existing people to a more favourable standpoint, then the position becomes one of trying to drag down the rest of their society to preserve an inefficient status quo.

Hmm, also a little fun to imagine what such a war would look like--the warriors would have to pretty much institute martial law in order to go everywhere a mage lived and seize them.

*** Winning by default... rather ambivalent about that. Well, now I at least know what it feels like :/

**** I won that way once too. I believe that seeing at least one story for a prompt is much better than seeing none, so you still deserve to be rewarded... but it definitely isn't as satisfying to win by default.

***** I think one would be better served to view the proffered gold as an enticement rather than simply as a reward, though it has qualities of both. For instance, I'm writing a piece for the current (“Eschaton”) challenge, but it will likely not be finished in time. But it /did/ get me out of a spell and into spelunking into one of my old universes again, so there's that. Now I merely want to explore this aspect of it, and the original challenge is merely the incitement, not the root.
