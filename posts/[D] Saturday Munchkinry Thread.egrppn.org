Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You are a human candle.

Your head from halfway up your neck is composed of tallow. You have a wick extending out of the top of your skull. The end of the wick is always burning, but never shrinks in length, or loses combustibility. The heat from your head-flame melts a small bowl in the top of your skull. If you tip your head over, the melted tallow will dribble down your head and harden.

This is natural to you: you suffer no injury from this process. The melted tallow will reform gradually over time. Your head feels no pain from your own flame's heat, or the heat of your melted tallow. If you cut down the length of your wick, it will also gradually grow back to its original length.

Your tallow is inconsistent in strength. Your head is composed of various tallows of differing hardness, corresponding to your bones, muscles and skin. This allows your neck to bend, and your face to emote. However, all can be deformed fairly easily, with sufficient pressure. You could poke a hole through your cheek with just a finger and a bit of effort.

Similarly, this deforming is inconsistent. Your tallow is most easily deformed when your head and face are at rest. When they are being actively used for something, they become much harder to alter. For instance, your teeth and jaws become solid as bone when chewing food, but could be bent all out of shape otherwise.

You're not sure what exactly counts as “at rest” and “in use” - it appears to be more intuitive than logical. However, your tallow will always melt if exposed to high temperatures.

Additionally, you have the ability to make your head-flame burn blindlingly bright, for up to 10 seconds. This is very tiring, and leaves you unable to use it again for several hours. It also drastically increases the heat output of your flame, melting your head much faster and to a greater extent than usual.

If your flame goes out at night, or during the day and is not re-lit before sundown, you will die. Shadowy wolves will emerge from your surroundings, and tear you limb from limb. These wolves are invisible and intangible to everyone except you, and will find and kill you no matter where you are or what you're doing. An outside observer will only see you suffer inexplicable bite and claw injuries, before you are torn to pieces by an unknown force.

*** THE BAD, it's mostly bad:

You look horrifying, the bowl in your head and the (in)consistency of your face are going to make social life very hard for you. You're going to be causing uncanny valley reactions all the time, dead bodies skin is commonly described as "waxy", and a all bone face when eating will look especially ghoulish.

You smell absolutely awful, like burning fat and greasy smoke unless you snuff your wick most of the time and even then you will smell like warm fat. The constant smoke and grease will play havoc on normal biology, staining, clogging pores, and contact dermatitis if aren't protected somehow.

You have to avoid "high" temperatures, 40 C(104 F) and above your entire head will start to melt(assuming beef tallow). This is a much bigger issue than you would think: your neck/tallow line will be around 37 C constantly due to body heat, there's an open flame up top, and your head cannot sweat or will do so ineffectively. Hot sunny day = melt, hot car = melt, most protective headgear = melt, too close to a heat source = melt. You get the idea, 40 C surface temp isn't hard to reach, you need to live in cold places and avoid a lot of situations.

A 40C fever (high grade fever) will melt at the neck/tallow boundary and make your entire head fall off. So don't get sick or get heatstroke.

THE GOOD?

You can reshape your face and head. Hire a sculptor or learn yourself, this will be important socially. Making your face less human will reduce the revulsion people will feel when watching it, CGI movies would be a good reference. Makeup and wigs should stay great but will apply weird with your tallow. You can and should disguise your wick as a quirky candle hat. The most human appearance would probably be just wrapping your entire face "for medical reasons" and keeping the wick snuffed and covered.

Your brain and head don't age? Whatever your personality is now running on probably won't lose function over time. You're immune to diseases from the neck up.

Your head might not feel pain?

You might be able to head transplant yourself to new bodies? Depends how finicky the tallow/nerve interface is.

The sunset limit isn't too bad, definitely don't go to sleep before sunset. Make sure your fire is lit and protected during that window, depending on the wick material you might be able to stick a fish bowl over the entire thing to protect it for example.

In summary: this seems like a curse. I wouldn't accept it for less than several million dollars and that's probably still not worth the mental harm unless you're immortal.

**** It was intended as a curse, yes. I was mostly wondering if there were any unforeseen side-effects one could exploit. I did not realise that the curse was way worse than I imagined.

The tallow melting is the biggest issue, in my mind. I only went with tallow because it's made of animal fat, and in my mind it had a thematic link to living bodies. What would be a good candlewax alternative, that would give the cursee a larger margin of error regarding temperatures?

***** Seems like an effective curse, if the goal is misery struggling to keep your head on is extra effective. Forcing them to live in the cold for melting and smell also has the benefit of making face skulpting stay better. Tallow does add to the smell and smoke grossness. Since it's a curse you can cut out my comments about being immune to tallow yourself, having that dripping and in contact with your skin all the time is extra awful. I think your neck line would rot from skin suffocation and moisture.

You might just use mutton tallow's mp(melting point), 45-50 C, or claim it's human tallow and make up a number. Tallow isn't a super consistent material, the dirtier it is the higher the mp, and you have magic, you can set the temperature to whatever as long as you explain some way.

Other waxes: Soy wax's mp range is 49-82 C. Petroleum jelly is a messier option and has a large mp range.

Another positive: the tallow might act like a non-Newtonian fluid, turning as hard as teeth when exposed to pressure. If it doesn't work like that, clenching your teeth hard before impact should work. If you leave the candle burning all the time you should be able to cover yourself in the tallow as armor, assuming you're magically immune to the tallow's effects on skin.

****** In my original idea, the main "problem" of the curse was the need to keep the wick lit at all times (if only to avoid it being left off come sunset, by accident). Then I added in the idea of the cursee's head being a giant candle, and was wondering what problems that might cause (a lot of /really bad ones/, it seems).

Furthermore, this was meant to be a curse that the cursee could reasonably live with for many, many years, instead of being so fragile and precarious that one bad day could kill them. There was also meant to be a small element of empowerment to it. Yes, you have to babysit this flame on top of your head for the rest of your life, but it's also a light-source that you will never be without, and can control its intensity.

So while I appreciate all the wonderful ways you can think of to make the curse worse, I'm probably going to dial back on it a lot. I guess I actually want it to be less of a curse, and more like a minor superpower with a nasty downside. Thanks for the feedback, though.

** I've been playing around with an idea for a superpower for a while now, and I've done most of the basic munchkinry, but I think there's still some wiggle room.

The power is energy conversion. Can destroy energy anywhere inside of the volume of her body and create energy in the equivalent volume outside of her body. High precision & control.

Specifically, she can convert internal calorific energy contained within the volume of her contiguous body (excludes interior of lungs and digestive tracts) into any form of energy anywhere within a contiguous equivalent volume in contact with the surface of her body, instantaneously (FTL so some wiggle room for retrocausality).

By default, the volume is a few centimetres above her skin and other bodily surfaces, but can be reduced in certain areas and increased in others.

The form and location are entirely thought-controlled and limited by imagination, however once the energy is created the power provides no further control over the energy.

Conversation rate reflects actual human energy usage rates during exercise and has similar impacts on her body, e.g. exhaustion, hunger

Direct Equivalences:

*Mass generation*:

1 metre of MWNT per second @1000W:

- A single thread of triple-walled carbon nanotube composed of 8-12-20 atom rings per 0.1nm length.\\
- Energy of forming bonds insignificant compared to mass generation.\\
- With a cross-section of 10^{-19} m^{2} & 100GPa could lift 10^{-10} N\\

10pg of Antimatter per second @1000W:

- 150 minutes to produce antimatter bomb equivalent to a stick of dynamite @100W.\\
- Limited usefulness due to time, containment requirements, and explosion by-products.\\

It would take 12 hours to produce the smallest dose of the strongest opioid (0.5 micrograms) @1000W, also hours for LSD & DMT.

@1000W 7.5 seconds to fill a brain with botox at LD50 dose (84 picograms)

- A tenth the transmitter power output of an FM radio station

*Electrical*:

Not sure about the physics for this one. Electrical sparks and arcs take surprisingly little power. But that might be due to potentials or ions that would be precursors to unleashing sparks. So might not work here.

- Taser equivalent @10W
- CNT are excellent conductors for ranged tasing.
- transcutaneous direct current stimulation of motor cortex for painkiller release @5W

  - @1000W speed = 2.6m/s\\
  - @100W = 1.2m/s\\

*Kinectic Energy on thrown objects*:

Putting KE into an object means it flies away and she can't put anymore KE into it as it's no longer in her volume of power output.\\
Using a rope means she can apply KE for longer but that only work if she has a strong enough rope and a way to deal with friction burn.\\
Luckily we've shown how she can make CNT which is strong and low friction.

Calculation PT= 0.5mv^{2} Integrate for distance. Differentiate for acceleration. I could be wrong about these numbers.

Hair counts as body volume as long as it is contiguous with the body. It doesn't add much to the volume but allows much more surface area to work with and some reach/range. While she can't create kinetic energy directly in her hair, she can create it in something in the volume around her hair. So wrap it up in some CNT and she's got TK hair. I estimate she could grow it out to about 3-4 meters with enough protection and care. This would make for an excellent means of remaining in contact with any object that needs a long distance to accelerate to effective speeds.

Power conversion is instantaneous. However since the greatest distance, she could produce energy at measures in metres, so energy would be produced ~10 nanoseconds before she imagines it in relativistic terms. However human reaction time measures in 100'000'000 of nanoseconds, so I don't see an easy exploit for time nonsense. I doubt she'd even detect the instantaneity of the power even under rigorous scientific testing, but it's secretly there if you can munchkin it.

*** Firstly, munchkining the power supply. "Internal calorific energy" isn't a thing as far as I can find, but "calorific value" is defined as "the total energy released as heat when a substance undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions". In a human, that would normally just be the energy obtained from eating, but what if you implanted a combustion generator under your skin? Would that increase your maximum power?

If you're measuring in volume but also doing things on the atomic scale, things would get a bit tricky. Does the space between atoms count towards "volume"? If so, then CNT would be seen as a solid tube of volume. If not, then you have to measure things by basing it on the atomic radii of all the atoms in your body.

There's also the problem of the definition of "contiguous". On the atomic scale, everything is just atoms, so where does the border lie between contiguousness and non-contiguousness? You're touching the air, which is touching the object - does that count? Or, you're touching the ground, which is touching the object. If rope works, then things like this should too.

On creation of matter: I'd imagine that, with the tiny amount produced at a time, the substance would be blown away the moment it's created in an environment that's not a vacuum. You'd have to make it in a sealed container or something.

In terms of what to make, there's the obvious production of rare substances to sell, like californium or diamond. However, with such precise control, you'd have a massive comparative advantage for the production of nanomachines and things for biotechnology. Meet with someone knowledgeable in the field and produce swarms of nanobots to do whatever, or leapfrog through CRISPR and technologies until you've got a cure for ageing. There's probably a variety of fields out there that can greatly benefit from atomic control.

In general: at this point, you're basically controlling forces as well as energy. Energy isn't a thing that can exist on its own - it has to be tied to other things. In this case, you'd be putting a pushing force on everything you kinetic-energy-ify. You'd be changing the abstract concept of "height" when you gravitational-potential-ify. You'd be creating magnetic fields when you magnetic-potential-ify. You'd be manipulating the strong force when you nuclear-potential-energy-ify.

If you can manipulate things on the scale of atoms, then there has to be a secondary power of total awareness of the volume you're manipulating. So, whatever you put in your energy-transferrance area, you can know absolutely everything about. Could allow you to (slightly) see through walls and such.

There could be shenanigans galore if you look at the quantum scale. Since you already have matter and photon creation and what basically amounts to telekinesis, when you add in chromodynamic energy and all the other types of binding energies, all sorts of things can be done, probably.

A mundane application would be cleaning. Just kinetic-energy away all the grime from your skin, hair and teeth - or even any dishes or surface you wipe your hand on - and, tada! 100% bacteria disposal.

Also, no need to wrap hair in CFT - you can just use the air around it.

And, finally, the FTL. Firstly, why are you including it? It seems like you're just breaking causality for no real reason, other than to have it broken. Why not have it just travel at the speed of light? Also, FTL-based experiments don't have to be based on your human reaction speed. Example: A detector and a guillotine is placed a metre away. Have a strand of hair go from your position to under the guillotine, then loop back to you, then to the detector. Have a continuous transferral of energy to the detector. After a time, the guillotine cuts your hair, which shuts off the transferral. But from your perspective (the relative perspective of your position, not necessarily your human perception), your transferral has stopped, but the guillotine hasn't finished cutting your hair off. Back at the detector, it detects the ceasing of transferral and stops the guillotine. However, that now leads to the guillotine having not completely cut through the hair so that it /should/ still be transferring energy, yet it /isn't/. Thus, causalityis violared.

*** Can you use this to create arbitrary small objects?

I'm thinking about biotech applications. A regular zygote only weighs like a microgram, so it takes about a month's work at 100W to assemble one. Imagine using this to make e.g. gene drive mosquitoes or designer babies. And at the same power draw, you can synthesize an arbitrary normal-sized prokaryote in ~900 milliseconds, which seems even more broken.

Of course, regulatory barriers preclude doing things like making vitamin-a-rich versions of every crop in existence with this power plus micropropogation, but still, any organism that can be described to you can be created.

While existing DNA sequences can be copied easily with PCR, the synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences currently costs cents per base pair. There's money to be made in this department.
