Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** After watching [[https://youtu.be/VzPD009qTN4][this video]] about the effect bacteria in our gut has on our bodies and minds, I got to wondering what implications this could have on transhumanist sci-fi scenarios. Would the psychology of uploads be fundamentally different if they didn't have complete simulated biochemistry? Could the relationship between bacteria and humans be used as a model for the sociological relationship between humans and singularity AIs?

The former question leads me to envision a future where humans can live comfortably as digital uploads in a simulated environment, but scarcity over processing power results in people paying extra to inhabit biological bodies. They see the influence their biology has over their mind as an aspect of their self that they couldn't otherwise experience. Thus, we have a disparity between social classes.

The latter question makes me think of some weird combination of space opera and Osmosis Jones. The galaxy is ruled by superintelligent AIs but humans live in relative autonomy and operate an economy that produces/refines things the AIs value. Each planet, city, or district functions as a living organism in a symbiotic relationship with its different classes of residents while interacting with other AIs the same way humans interact with each other.

Put the two ideas together, and we have a reason why AIs wouldn't just assimilate everyone into a hive mind uploaded into solar system-sized supercomputers. To do so would mean denying themselves potentially valuable sensations or cognitive functions, possibly turning them into ruthless optimization machines that would be destroyed for violating the social contract with other singularity minds. What do you guys think?

*** Working off of your "limited resources emulation" idea, what if poor people got brain scans, middle class got brain + nerves, upper class got that + blood chemistry, and the 1% got a full microbiome as well. Anything not scanned got a generic average replacement that is optimized for performance instead of fidelity.

**** What I like about this idea is that it rationalized why people would to want to inhabit human bodies if they can download their mind into anything. It gives justification for a person's body to be seen as a status symbol, like how it is in the setting Eclipse Phase.

In EP, it's much cheaper to live in the cloud without a permanent body and simulations are so advanced that I wondered why nearly everyone either has or wants an expensive organic body. Now there's an explanation that isn't all irrational bias.

Humans aren't just sentimental about our natural forms or prejudiced against artificial options, we're simply concerned over much influence our body has over our mind and whether that means our body is an intrinsic part of our identity.

Maybe I find this a more interesting question than most people because I have never viewed my body as an intrinsic part of my identity and wholeheartedly welcome the possibilities transhumanism presents, but discoveries about the microbiome could challenge that view.

/Yes, period./ This is one of those Embodied Mind things. A fair portion of the signals coming into your brain, /especially/ the reward/value signals, are interoceptive signals about the state of your body's internals. That is actually where your emotions are coming from.

You're going to need a reasonably well-simulated biochemistry to get a reasonably well-simulated experience of being /human/, even mentally human/oid/.

** So, I'm trying to get a plot skeleton for an urban fantasy werewolf novel I may or may not end up writing.

One of the two potential main characters is a "supernatural lawyer" - basically, she helps any local supernatural creatures ("sups") navigate the law. This can be anything from stealing identities, doing immigration paperwork, that sort of thing, or it can be stuff like telling a vampire client who was done for murder that it will be "only 20 years" and arranging for them to get special treatment with no exposure to the sun for their "medical issues".

I am thinking a good story to tell might be the story of her "getting her big break" - my current headcanon is that she defended a siren in a high-profile murder investigation, lost the case, but got that siren some special treatment that they really needed during the sentencing (house arrest? got a dietitian to sign off on the siren getting an all-meat diet due to some "medical condition"?), and that made her well-known to sups.

But I think that's not very interesting. I think it might be more interesting to tell a story of how she helped a sup /integrate/ into society (you know, "we don't kill and eat people. you WILL get noticed."/"you fed someone a burger with human meat you bought on the black market and now they have kuru? let's make sure that it never gets back to you" - that sort of thing).

But I don't know, I'm too steeped in my tiny little corner of my brain and I think I need to be poked by external forces. So I'd love some help with the brainstorming thing to get me thinking of other things.

So, my question this week:

If there was a lawyer who dealt with supernatural creatures, specifically in helping them operate in society in a human-ish manner, what sort of things would the lawyer deal with?

*** Can vampires have their picture taken (for ID, etc)? If not, she could have contact with a casting agency+makeup artist+photographer (or digital painter, or other sets of people) to create images that match their appearance.

ADA (or equivalent disability act) consultation for werewolves needing the full moon off.

Getting shapeshifters, werehumans, and some types of faerie certified as service dogs (or whatever species) to get additional rights in public settings. Also arranging "handlers" that are "guided" by them to wherever the "dog" wants to go, such as a movie.

Setting up corporate systems so that a genius locus (sentient area of land) can own and manage itself.

Wills and estate planning for beings with non-traditional life cycles (immortality, reincarnation, etc.)

Helping changelings get emancipated from their parents before 18, if they want.

Explaining to adult changelings that involuntary baby-trading is /very/ illegal.

Standard immigrant integration classes, plus human specific things like "Octarine is not a color people can see", "-30 is cold", and "feeding someone does not create a debt to you".

The laws surrounding prostitution for succubi, and how you can get caught by them even if you don't ask for money.

Consent and mind control/compulsion.

Oracles/seers and insider trading.

**** Thank you for the ideas!

The sups as service animals is excellent.

I also like the idea of her organising a class at a community centre with a suitably boring name that is instructed by one of her "success stories".

(Never heard of genius loci but I really love the entire concept.)

** After reading Please Understand Me 2, a book on Kiersey's take on temperament, which I think is much more empirical than the MBTI since it focuses on observing human behavior than introspection on one's feelings, I got a weird idea for a relatively more rational take on the houses of Harry Potter.

Kiersey divided the 16 temperaments into 4 groupings, each with their own list of stuff and a mythological ideal which represents the category.

Grffindor - Artisan Known as the Dionysian temperament, they live in the moment, and desire freedom and adventure.

Hufflepuff - Guardian Known as the Epimethean temperament, they are hard working, and focused on heritage and the community.

Ravenclaw - Rational Known as the Promethean temperament, they are focused on understanding the world, and continuing progress.

Slytherin - Idealist Known as the Apollonian temperament, they are focused on self-actualization, and on the values and ideas that give meaning to one's life.

I have no idea what to do with the idea but I'm not surprise to find Slytherin being the idealist house. To strive for an ideal will make one do things both terrific and terrible to reach it.
