*** My thoughts:

It seemed to me that one of the Players had been unexpectedly deascended... (anger => confusion => horror => expecting to have special powers => instantly going to the console to do damage control), except that doesn't /quite/ fit, because why would they be deascended rather than killed, so maybe that was the avatar being cut off from the E/C controls and being on a mission on his own.

The blue avatar seems to have deliberately finished his quest and straightened himself before being torn apart, which means he did something he anticipated to be killed for, and yet knew in advance he wouldn't be killed for /before/ he was done, since he expected to be killed shortly after finishing his task.

One possible explanation: Player 1 (Crayak(?)) sacrificed himself to stop the Chee.

Problem: Once one of the players wins, they instantly remake the universe in their image. So that was probably just the death of the avatar (or a deascended instance of one of the players, maybe - that would fit both the reaction and also the fact that the game hasn't ended yet).

I wonder who killed V3('s Yeerk bodies) and why.

** Well, that was quite the chapter. Looks like quantum viruses took out all the Chee, the Avatar, and all of the Visser. I think that this was an equivalent to the nukes being launched in the Cold War, and now everyone involved is dead.

And the ending promises to reveal WTF is going on with Rachel now. With the Chee, Visser, and most of the Howlers all dead we might even get a chance to breathe! Probably not though, I get the sense that we still haven't quite hit the true climax.

I'm not sure about any of these. There's another thread here about the Chee. For the avatar, similarly, I wouldn't expect his whole body to go, just something it relies on so it can't keep functioning; and if it did go entirely, I wouldn't expect the ropes of shadow.

The Visser? Could be, especially if the shards are still there just inert, I'm not sure if we'd know. But the shards getting removed entirely seems more likely than the Chee getting removed entirely, at any rate. Buut, I think if the shards get removed entirely, the Visser's controlling body probably wouldn't get quantumed, whereas a surgical strike disabling the shards could also disable the controlling body?

*** The Avatar claimed that the controlling Player could not use it to lie, but that hardly means anything.

The Chee did get contained before they got to Mars which implies Player 2 saw this coming. OTOH, either one player just suffered a huge defeat (checkmate even?), or the computer itself had to act.

IRL this would be an obvious P2 victory. But combined with vague hints with Rachel being Unexpected, and the genre-fact that Rachel reappearing means she's not just there to say "yup, the P2 victory was overdetermined since before we were born, but as a side effect of recent events I've returned and we can feel depressed together for a few minutes", there's a distinct possibility this isn't playing out like P2 foresaw.

If it isn't going according to plan, or if P2's cheaty actions are letting him lie, or if there never was a barrier to lying- then V3 may have gone to the place that chalk figures go when erased.

**** I reread all the interludes.

Rachel is strongly implied to be unintended. This does not seem to make her invisible to the Players- her morph-gate gets moved away from the meteor. If she's invisible to the Chee, it may imply the Chee were tuned to the original Animorphs (and Ax/Garrett, who were presumably Intended) but not Rachel.

A Player altered at least one Howler ship to ensure the Americas were not the first to be hit.

The Unity player gave V3 access to the Howler file. It had decided this was the end-game. Perhaps was to make V3 act differently, and/or get his network set up, so he would get the message & feel confident with the Chee being loosed?

I suspect someone acted to give Garrett the Feeling he should not hand the Cube to the Chee. This could be P2 ensuring the Chee couldn't hack the hypercomputer, or him setting up details of the un-binding of the Chee. Or doing something related to Rachel.

I'm putting more weight on the Ellimist having just lost a lot, acting against the Rules in a last ditch, and getting destroyed by the Arbiter. Less likely, the Ellimist saw it all coming & played along, a 3rd entity is futzing with stuff, or [other stuff I haven't thought of].

*** It could be that the gift was something straightforwardly useful, like a planet-sized nanobot factory or something, but P2 omitted the fact that P1 would murder Esplin before he got the occasion to use the gift.

So strictly speaking everything P2 said was accurate and none of what he encouraged Esplin to do put him in danger within the rules of the game, but P2 knew that P1 would violate the rules of the game to kill Esplin anyway.

So if V3 is dead, he must have made taking his life extremely costly for one of the players. So I'd say this will give a strong advantage to one side now.

Also if V3 is dead, this will make player 2's reputation suffer, since the Andalite, that was captured with the Avatar message for him, should be free now.

Maybe both players agreed that V3 went too far, and it was a free action.

** Here's my guess as to what happened: a quantum virus was activated that targeted communication systems that use a particular interface with the hypercomputer.

- Visser's yeerk-lite get shriveled because he uses that interface to be a big ol intergalactic hive mind

- the Avatar gets busted (but crucially, not the ellimist or crayack) as they use the same interface to control the shared host.

- Rachel gets freed because her problem was being entangled with the interface as opposed to actually integrating with it

- the Chee get chumped because (one can only conclude) they use such an interface to communicate with one another at vast distances

Now the one thing this doesn't explain is why the Avatar entirely got shredded; my only flailing knee jerk is "fail safes so mere mortals can't inspect the divine avatar at a bad time". We don't know yet if the Chee have similarly been shredded or if they've just been deactivated; depending on how much of their processing power came from the gestalt network, it may or may not have been enough to reduce them to chunks of very fancy metal.

/Two/ quantum virii, one to sever the connection and leave them vulnerable, and another to obliterate them? But that starts to get wobbly.

I'm not sure what mechanism would extract the Visser's yeerk and disentangle Rachel's head without affecting the rest of the biology, but would obliterate the Chee chassis.

Perhaps instead of the quantum virus being responsible for their disintegration, there's a second mechanism responsible for that? Tobias didn't see what happened, did the Avatar eject them/morph them away/annihilate them as a separate action from taking out the terrestrial Chee? Is there another plot going on; did the Visser manage to seize them during the chaos, or did the Ship do something?

With regards to Animorphs, I feel like we to see the final chapters before making a conclusion. From what I've seen, it's starting to get to the point where each chapter breaks my immersion further with how far off the rails we've gotten and how little agency the pov characters actually have. It feels like throughout most of the book it was just the main characters getting dicked around by V3, god and, while it makes sense that they were never able to truly get any sense of agency, it does feel a little bad that even in the final hour we still have things happen around us rather than because of us. As the other people said though, i have faith that the last chapters will be satisfying, it just feels like the hoops that they have to jump through to be satisfying gets more and more difficult with each successive chapter.

**** (spoilers for Chili) in part what C_Densem said. I think it was around the abstraction room for me. I did not mind the Mahuika backstory, and the pun was pretty great. My issue is that the story started feeling prettty rushed leading into the street pickle, so it felt less like a careful deliberate setup for a pun and more like the author just giving up on the story.

The worrying (now gone) personal authors notes of a later chapter probably contributed to my view.

Oh right. This is not exactly my concern with The Reckoning, sorry. It is hard to put in words but basically the steps taken in Chili to bring the story to that final setting (tropes used and what not). I might have to come back to this for a more specific sort of analysis.

***** Part of my concern likely stems from nostalgia for the earlier chapters and how the scope of things has become huge in later chapters. That is not a criticism, though. But like others have commented here, there is a whole lot of mysteries now to hopefully be resolved.

If these were to be resolved through for example it was all a dream or everything after X was a simulation/all in your head or everything is undone/made irrelevant by time travel/alternate reality travel or 4th wall stuff, I might find it to be a bit cheap. I understand bits and pieces of what has happened since the first chapter to probably be planted memories or not quite as it at first seemed, but if everything was to turn into that ehh.

Overall the comparison might be a moreof a je ne sais quoi. I think what I was saying is that so far my impression is things have been connected pretty nicely (with a roughish pace/style change around Madagascar). I look forward to see how the last few chapters are tied into this (no pressure or anything), and regardless of what happens next I have enjoyed the story so far.

But yes hopefuly some of this made my concerns less vague.

** I think the Visser and the Chee were killed because they /intentionally/ broke one of the "Rules" in the game between Crayak and the Ellimist. The rule is roughly that there are certain weapons and techniques that are forbidden, and one of these is the nanofactory. The Visser is implicated because of knowingly releasing the Chee. If you want to play Singularity while still following the "rules" I think you have to do so within certain boundaries that don't change the universe too much for other agents, lest you break a norm that protects more powerful agents from doing it to you.

If the Animorphs had intentionally decided to use the quantum virus to defeat the Howlers, they would've met the same fate. They were saved from making that decision by the Ellimist's move of bringing Cassie in to sway their choice.

I also think, based off the events of this chapter, that Crayak [Order Unity Silence][Player 1] is currently more aligned with Visser 1 and Chee, while the Ellimist [Chaos Harmony Noise][Player 2] is currently more aligned with the Yeerks, and Animorphs and the Howlers. However I think that the /locked/ Chee would have been compatible with the Player 2 goal. The unlocking makes them change to the other side.

I speculate that Player 2 likes chaotic elements that keep the story going, while Player 1 wants things to sort of settle down. Yeerks, Humans, Andelites, and Howlers as a species all value experience, life and playing games with multiple players. The Chee and Visser 1 do not really care about that. But this probably isn't the whole story because you'd think forbidding certain types of singularities makes it so that Player 1 is at a big disadvantage. It could be that player 2 is simply stronger and only keeps player 1 around to keep the game going.

Maybe they weren't just forbidden from trying to ascend to godhood themselves, they were compelled to /stop anyone else/ from ascending as well. They were able to give Tobias the key when they did because for the first time ever, they thought somebody was within 6 steps of ascending to AGI superpower status. But since the ship didn't have any weapons and there were so many possibilities (if they really stretched those steps by massively overanalyzing each one), they didn't predict that giving the key to Tobias would lead to violence.

******* Btw since I was thinking about the Marclones, a couple of points:

I get the impression that they work off powers of 2 as their version control system, as seen in Ch 15, featuring Marcos 2^{14} and 2^{15,} and Ch 37, featuring Marcos 2^{27,} 2^{35,} 2^{41,} among others, and Ch 44. However:

Why is Hedwig/2^{27} Marco Prime? I would have thought Prime would have the highest ID number, which keeps increasing, unless I'm severely misunderstanding the system.

In Ch 44, the Marcos have odd numbers of the form 2^{n} -1 instead, such as 2^{40} -1 and 2^{45} -1. Any reason why (especially since there's a 2^{41} and a 2^{40} -1)?

+In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is a magic xylophone, or something? Ha ha, boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.+

Then I decided not to do that plan.

Then I made mistakes myself. =P

I wanted to claim that it was on purpose, but there's no way Marco would've failed to notice the numbers becoming /odd./ Alas.

Hedwig became Marco Prime when the other four surviving Marcos on the excursion went Controller. At that point, they switched from "the Marco who was revived earliest" to "this guy."

originally I didn't notice they were 2^{n} -1 and my comment said 'Marco may be a ruthless tactical genius, but he probably isn't getting into AP math'. Then I noticed the pattern and wondered if there was a reason for it.

On that note, it /would/ have been pretty cool to see one of the Animorphs make basic math mistakes. It really humanizes the characters. It says something when I read a story with shapeshifting aliens and the most unrealistic part is when I say to myself 'why is everyone here from high schoolers to the POTUS this good at thinking and how do I go to this planet'?

I really love the parts that remind us that the Animorphs are just +random+ kids, such as the crude jokes between Marco and Jake. This would have been one such example, although the boy who decided to use powers of 2 probably would have known they weren't supposed to be odd.

** Observation: One of the rules that the Avatar explicitly mentioned is that when a player makes a move, the other player gets a free move with the same cost. This is shown in the form of teleporting the Animorphs Vs revealing the Asteroid to Vissor III.

Hypothesis: We just saw such an exchange. One player used a highly costly move to remove the Chee, allowing the other to remove the Vissor. This might even have been the point of setting up the unboxxing of the Chee, so as to remove the two most powerful pieces.

Now, as for the Gainaxy bit with the Avatar's apparent destruction, the appearance of the hypercomputer, and Rachel's sudden awakening ... I can only piggyback off everyone else's wild speculation.

All I have to go on is the meta knowledge from canon, that Crayak made a show of tempting Rachel to his side in book 48 (I think? The ordering got weird right when I missed the V II encounter.). That book felt like disappointing fanservice and filler, tbh, "hey, there are these popular loose ends with Crayak and David. Let's do something with them real quick, since we're about to start the endgame." In fairness to Applegate, I can see this as being a necessary test Rachel must pass before she can fulfill her mission in the final book, from some weird Ellimist's-eye view, and V III turning into a sentient puddle of Jello was ... memorable,.

That's sort of been in the backof my head whenever something draws attention to Rachel's coming across as a glitch in the [time?] Matrix. Canonically, Crayak made a hamfisted attempt to turn her, and when he failed, she made a huge impact, seemingly in the Ellimist's favor. If that same dynamic is at play here, it's going to be far more complex, and I have no idea where it's going or how the hints we've been given tie into it.

(Also, the Vissor's avatars on the Andalite homeworld kinda reminded me of the Drode. Probably just because they sounded more deinonichusy than Hork Bajiry, and in context, I was primed to think about E/C-related things.)

You know, the only Gainax anime I've ever actually finished is FLCL[1], so maybe I shouldn't throw around the word "Gainax" as an adjective... but somehow, it seems appropriate as a description for this chapter, in particular.

[1] WTF voiceover pronounces "FLCL" as "Fooly Cooly" who put that in there? The same person who changed how it pronounces "Pokemon"? Why couldn't they fix the pronunciation of "potion" (/paʃən/? Why is it /paʃən/?)?

My initial understanding of the Visser vanishing was that he managed to upload himself into the hypercomputer now that it is revealed, though I guess that doesn't really work at all well with the Visser's hosts being freed. No way he would just vanish like that.

Did he actually get quantum virused out of existence? That...wow. I'm really hoping that Rachel was being a god-puppet or something and knows everything about everything because how else will this ever get explained

It does make sense though that a god had a preparation to quantum virus the Chee! They probably have those for all the AIs that exist, you really don't want someone new coming up to threaten you after all.

  I'm really hoping that Rachel was being a god-puppet or something
#+end_quote

My impression is that it's the other way around.

Rachel went abruptly unconscious when the morph cube --- a link to the gods' supercomputer in z-space --- was destroyed. Theory: the mind controlling her body was not actually in her body at the time (explaining her cognitive difficulties to that point), and destroying the cube severed that connection.

So if her consciousness wasn't in her body, where was it? Probably at the other end of the link represented by the cube, so, the supercomputer itself.

Up until the cube was destroyed, most of her attention appears to have been on the degraded, laggy connection with her body. But when that connection is severed, maybe she starts to take a look around. Suddenly, there aren't just two players with root access to play with the fundamentals of reality, there are *three*. And while two of them have very oblique and ineffable motives and conditions for victory, one is wholly on board with team Animorph and team humanity, and doesn't care about the rules the other two have laid down for their little game.

That's my theory about the events of the past chapter. Rachel isn't a god-puppet, she's ascended to godhood herself.

I hadn't noticed this as support for a third intelligence until now, but if we buy that Crayak and Ellimist have both been around forever, then that can't be their origin story, and presumably it should end up relevant somehow.

** My best guess at what just happened: The major crux decision of the series is whether or not to give the Chee sentience. They were given sentience, and subsequently killed the howlers which were (presumably) Crayaks “army,” and his army now knows what defeat looks like. Even if the Howlers aren't all wiped out, they have now encountered an enemy that essentially killed them for sport. This will at best cause them to be more cautious/less likely to roll up on other planets dicks out, and at worst terrified of death, which would make them useless as shock troops (in canon this was accomplished through kissing, if i recall correctly). I would call this a major loss for Crayak and win for Ellimist.

** Okay, gotta assume we're at last call for guessing what's going on with Rachel, so now that the Chee have all been erased from existance it's time to layout how Chee!Rachel works even better than ever.

First, some Chee facts (mixed with Chee assertions that Erek made to Rachel):

Chee have selectively perfect memories. They remember everything, unless they choose to forget.

Chee can read and write memories of Yeerks.

Chee can perform surgery without tripping any of their anti-violence blocks.

Chee are prohibited from giving weapons to humans when they know they're going to be used for violence.

Chee are cheeting cheeters that cheet.

So, when Erek, Rachel, V3, and the kid V3 was controlling were all in a hypersight moment the Chee got a full copy of their brainstate (like with Quat and V3).

After that moment, the Chee had a problem. They know where the blue box is, and they know that Rachel is going to go for it, and they're prohibited from giving something to a human who they know is going to commit violence.

Erek (and another Chee) meet up with Rachel when she goes to get the blue box and explain the situation to her. There are ways around it, but Erek leads her to a solution that Rachel at peak self-loathing because of the Chapman kerfuffle can't help but accept.

So Erek preps Rachel for surgery. The Chee that came with him has been stripped down to something capable of controling a human and is running a copy of Rachel.exe. Erek inserts the other Chee into Rachel, making sure that it will blend with her when she morphs, just like Elfangor's earplugs.

Chee!Rachel starts simulating the Rachel brain state which puppets Rachel's body, and goes on about her business with the blue box.

"No violence here Mr. Censor," says Erex, whistling innocently. "Just letting a Chee walk away with this dangerous weapon, no problem." He then wipes his memory of what he just did, to avoid losing the plausible deniability that let him do it in the first place.

"No violence here Mr. Censor," says the Chee in Rachel's head, whistling innocently. "Just simulating this human and definitely not paying any attention to what she's doing."

Once Tom brings Rachel back, the new iteration has issues because of the Chee still running the show. Chee memories are backed up to the cloud, so Rachel seeing memories of her previous self are because of that. The seizures trigger at the exact moment control switches from the hypercomputer simulation to the body and the memories from the time morphed are written to the brain. They might be being caused by the interaction between the leftover Yeerk tissue and the Chee, or because the Chee's memories of the previous Rachel are causing problems.

Once all of the Chee get poofed, actual Rachel is back in control and is good to go.

--------------

Some problems with this theory (please add to this, if someone can kill this theory I get to stop thinking about it):

#+begin_quote
  Why did Rachel have future memories that one time?
#+end_quote

Cashing in my "the Players did it" token on this one. Both times Jake got ressurected, he had a Player related vision. Maybe that was Rachel's, given to her by one of the Players to prevent Marco from killing Cassie.

#+begin_quote
  But the Chee said that Erek was the only Chee that teleported away from the Yeerk pool. Wouldn't Rachel count for that?
#+end_quote

The ellipses in that segment are doing some work there. We know it's not a perfect sequence since some of the Chee are already dead. So something like:

[No. Has three-four-five-six?]

[Don't worry about it. Has three-four-five-seven?]

Seems plausible.

#+begin_quote
  Okay but why can't the Chee acknowledge to themselves that Rachel is being driven by a Chee. Why is she the female instead of just another Chee?
#+end_quote

Erring on the side of not triggering anti-violence protocols. They don't need to know that what's going on with Rachel, and if they ever do the Chee that is piloting her can let the rest know. They can just flag her as something weird but not to be thought deeply about and move on.

#+begin_quote
  What's up with Rachel in the mind meld with everyone?
#+end_quote

V3 has never been in a mindmeld with a Chee that has had time to prepare countermeasures for it. The Chee can just grey rock it until the mindmeld ends.

#+begin_quote
  Why did Rachel react to the Visser destroying the cube?
#+end_quote

...good question actually, I have no idea.

  They didn't really get much out of that trip beyond access to the yeerk fleet, unless I am forgetting something, and without that they probably would've just died on earth and Tobias would've just left, so the events that caused one player to win wouldn't have happened.

** I am arguably confused more than the characters, because not only I am confused about the in-universe events, like they are, but also about the narrative purpose of.... I want to say "this chapter," but honestly, it's more like "the last five chapters." While most stories the to unveil their mysteries when close to the end, here the mysteries are being piled on in rapid succession. I don't quite see the point of that, but I genuinely believe in author's mastery to pull a satisfying resolution off. We'll see.

As of right now, there's just /too much/, rather than /too little/, to make any theories, imho. Any attempt will miss at least one important detail, but probably more.

Here's my attempt to list these important details, but, of course, it's probably inconclusive:

1. Marco mentioned that the Yeerks didn't see them in one of the first chapters because sometimes, things /simply/ go wrong. There was an opportunity to get it right, but you fucked it up. (I think, there's a narrative significance there, but I can't quite make it out.)

2. They've been funneled towards /something/---maybe Chee unlocked, maybe something else. How does that bode with the rest of events?

3. The Avatar appearing and taking over the Good Ship.

4. Supercomputer's output devices (?, according to the Visser---but I would trust him on this one) appearing around Earth, presumably from the Z-space.

5. The Chee were being deactivated by the Avatar, but presumably not quantum-virused---i.e., not erased.

6. Then after the Avatar pulls his hand away from the console, he, the Visser, and Chee all got erased from the existence, /somehow/ (presumably by the way of the quantum virus, but who the fuck knows).

7. Cassie brought Rachel, visibly in full health, who asked for a Leeran.

/How/ can one tie /all/ of this together is beyond me.

*Late edit*: One question that really gnaws me is what unites specifically the Avatar, Visser, and Chee, so it was specifically them (and probably only them) who disappeared? I have two options, but the answer is likely "neither, these are several separate events in play" or something even more complex.

The first option is Visser and Chee are pawns of the player(s), and as the Game was won by one of them, the Avatar disappeared and so did the pieces. The main contradiction to this hypothesis is that the Animorphs /really/ seem to be the pieces themselves, or at least massively important to the Game in other way, and so they should've been gone as well.

The second option that comes to mind is that the Visser desperately wanted access to the hypercomputer, and in this very chapter he was salivating at the sight of it. Off-screen, he probably put a ton of effort into trying to break into it as soon as it appeared from the Z-space, and Chee also probably reacted to it in some way once the output device started disabling them. What I'm getting at is that the Avatar, Visser, and Chee were linked to the hypercomputer at the moment when /something/ happened, which either freed Rachel or /was done/ by Rachel. It seems like a stretch, but I feel like the answer actually can be along those lines considering we had a lot of mentions of how the Visser wanted to access the hypercomputer.

*** One thing to keep in mind is there are likely two different opposing plans at work, with the opposing plans designed to hide pieces and mislead the super intelligence behind the opposite plan. So what two sets of pieces are most separate/hidden from each other? I think Rachel not being modeled by the Chee and whatever is going on with her represents one plan and the hidden message to the Visser to allow the Chee to get unchained and all the pressure along that line represent another.

Also no Quantum virus is needed, direct access to the Z-space computer allows jacking things into Z-space (like what happened to Cassie). Also the Quantum virus erases particular molecular sequences, not entirely macro-scale beings. So you could probably find unique molecular sequences common to the upgraded Visser 3, and even the Chee, but this would be erasing critical molecular components, not erasing them entirely.

Edit: doing a reread, the Chee deactivated, then disappeared. So two mechanisms at work? Quantum virus for the initial deactivation, z-space yoinking for an extra precaution? It seems like overkill, but perhaps if you are the Ellimist/Crayak you don't take chances with strong AI? Or maybe they both independently had mechanisms in place to take out the Chee?

**** It's been discussed in the story a few times that the Players have taken pains to stop recursive self-improvement. For example, they did so by sabotaging the Andallites' culture. While reading this chapter, I had the fun complementary thought that perhaps both Crayak and Ellimist like to elevate their pieces to as high a level as they possibly can without quite triggering a singularity. Counterintuitive dynamics in optimization like that are always fun to come across.

I also like the related conceit that a path to godhood could be just a few moments away for many appropriately nudged sentients of ordinary intelligence, with the reason it doesn't happen being endless near-perfect plays and counterplays on the level of tiny molecular disturbances. That forced equilibrium would feel /fairer/ than reality's accidental one. For example, it feels unfair that it's so hard to do math when so much of math is just tautology. Knowing that a conspiracy of evil daemons prevents us from bootstrapping logical insights together like naively should be possible would actually be reassuring, in a way.

The Avatar, Visser, and the Chee are all incredibly intelligent.

My guess is that there were a series of failsafes to prevent any third superintelligence from ascending to a point where it could threaten the Players. One of them was triggered by the Chee going FOOM, and instantly destroyed all intelligences above a certain (extremely high) threshold, except the Arbiter itself.

The Avatar was enraged, manifested physically on Good Ship's deck (because of course it was there, invisible, watching the main event), and tried to destroy the Chee with its godpowers. The Chee had already figured out how to disable that particular function, so the Avatar tried to shut them down manually. Then the Chee disabled the hypercomputer's cloaking system, and that triggered a failsafe that killed any potential AGI in the system (or universe?).

  Both the player and the adversary had watched as the Visser's investigations proceeded, his cautious forays into the structure of the hypercomputer stymied by its failsafes and firewalls (and his own desire to avoid notice). He was a bug in the code---a mite, a bacterium, a lowly prion drifting in the infinite hallways of the arbiter, unable to comprehend the majesty of what he could barely even perceive. They had left him alone, by mutual agreement---content to wait and see as the main game proceeded.

  But now---

  It was such a small thing. A slight weakening in the protections of an ancient, irrelevant archive, a tumbler set to turn at the lightest, slightest touch, opening the path to a single unencrypted file containing a mere four billion bits of information. The adversary was busy, juggling the ten trillion coincidences required for it to take advantage of the player's apparent blunder. The theft would not be noticed. It would not be recorded. The adversary might never even know it had occurred---not until the effects showed themselves within the game proper, and perhaps not even then. It was information the Visser was already bound to discover, after all, once the Z-space bridge had fulfilled its intended purpose.

Theory: The Chee cracked the hypercomputer's logs and went searching for anything it had recorded about the Howlers. They found that file, and while it hadn't been recorded, they used data forensics to prove that it had been opened in the last year. The Ellimist claimed victory on the grounds that Crayak broke Their mutual agreement to ignore V3's meddling with the hypercomputer, and the Arbiter agreed. The Ellimist no longer needed to hide Itself, so It stopped; and Its next act was to erase the Chee and the Visser before they became a threat.

The r!version is that the Chee figured out a memetic virus that would stop the Howlers. Either they taught a Howler ways of experiencing pure joy without hurting anyone, effectively turning the Howlers into another echo of the Pemalite race, or they found the Howler equivalent of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i6QIuNS8j8][chicken hypnosis]], or simply the memory of being on the other side of a massacre would be enough to stop their crusade throughout the rest of the Universe.

#+begin_quote
  “There was another instance,” the man interrupted. “More---blatant. One I suspect you know nothing about. I was able to take you in Wyoming because I was forewarned. The boy betrayed you---David, the one you took under your wing. He was afraid you were condemning him to die---wanted to bargain for protection---reached out to me in Vietnam. And when I dug through your memories, afterward, I found a discrepancy. You morph-checked him, Marco, using Alloran's backdoor---looked inside his mind. You could not possibly have missed his dysfunction. He was a textbook psychopath. Abused, damaged. Utterly without loyalty or principle. Yet you demorphed believing him to be the perfect recruit---went so far as to describe him as a miniature version of your fearless leader.”

  There was a tight, wild silence---

  “How do you know that your memories aren't being tampered with?”

  “I don't. Would you find it reassuring, if they were?”

  “You could be lying,” Jake pointed out. “Easier to lie than to edit a memory.”

  “I have ways of demonstrating my honesty. *But the larger point stands---we are being interfered with. All of us.* The cube, the bridge, your little field trip. I see no reason why your mother should be assumed immune. *And the interventions are growing less and less subtle*---now, at this critical moment, they've brought dear Cassie Withers back from the dead in spectacularly dramatic fashion. Why?”
#+end_quote

Seems to be quite different than what V3 thinks - and considering that the earlier interventions were subtle, I'd argue that a simple 'forget to scan for life forms' is totally within the subtle category.

I mean, at the end of the day you're the author and I understand that you want the reader to know that nah, E/C really don't stick their fingers into pies as much as we think. But I think that throughout the many chapters it seems to be otherwise, and to just take Marco's word for it feels...well, kinda irrational! Maybe it'd be good to have a more direct E/C confirmation of this at the end/epilogue? Like Rachel asking the Ellimist if she mattered in canon.

** Huh have the chee been manipulating characters this whole time, with animorphs thinking it was the gods? In terms of actions they've taken, was it six steps to ascension?

1. At the school, get the visser and elfangor (who turned out to be rachel) to expose a chee to a Leeran, gaining full information from both sides, learning about morphing and the andalite at the bottom of the sea.

At this point, I think erek has the required info to:

1. beach that whale for tobias, don't think about how it'll eventually die, but now tobias can get the good ship. (The response to this seems to be a player having visser three kill tobias, hence the david intervention) So now the chee have six steps and full but out of date leeran info on the visser

New plan: 1. Manipulate telor lottery so a morpher comes to Brazil (luckily it is tobias) 2. Give tobias key to good ship 3. Manipulate ax into building z-space communicator 4. Call the howlers and tell them earth is interesting, don't think about the space mines 5. Be present at the council meeting 6. Ask nicely to be unbound

What i can't quite figure out is why then tobias had to keep grabbing bigger and bigger animals in the interlude, since if it was the chee they'd just drop another one on him I think?

I'm generally feeling low confidence about each of these theories, but I feel high confidence that at least one event the characters blame on E/K was actually chee manipulation.

Also, I think I'm getting closer to understanding why the chee were holding onto the morph cube and tobias earlier on, which is still a big puzzle for me
