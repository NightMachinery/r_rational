Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/972666][Tao of the Force]] is a Star Wars fanfiction for the latest movies, where we get to see what it would be like if Rey and Ren had decided to unite forces to end the war and bring actual good change to the galaxy. Rey decides to start a religion that takes all the good pieces of both the light and the dark, creating the grey-scale Magi; Ren decides to create a government that genuinly works for the people.

I had found this one last year, and though it's really smutty (like a *lot* of fan-service scenes, especially in the first part) I think it gets really rational in the second bit. (One of the tags is "porn with philosophy", to give you an idea.) It's been a while since I read the first part, but I think the author generally lets you know when you're about to read a chapter that's nsfw.

There are a few places where it's not entirely rational, but I really liked how it had a better plot for the new movies and actually did something about that whole Ren teleporting thing, and then showing some actual leadership skills. I haven't seen the latest movie, so I don't know for sure, but based on reviews I think Tao of the Force gives a more satisfying, rationalist storyline.

*** As somebody interested in asceticism, Rey's whole bit on ‘my feelings matter a lot' so totally writes off the philosophical traditions, particularly Taoism and Buddhism, that the Jedi were seemingly based on. It's giving the Idiot ball to a whole lineage of magical diplomat monks, and it feels totally unjustified.

(To be fair, the government the Jedi were fighting for wouldn't have done well on pure asceticism anyway.) Are there any stories that /do/ explore the philosophy? I haven't found any that worked with the latest movies yet.

** I've been rping in a play by post subreddit on and off over the years in my time in reddit. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/YouEnterADungeon][r/YouEnterADungeon]] Not all of the gaming runs were great; inexperienced gms can be prone to things like railroading for example. But there were some really creative writers in some of the games I had played - I saved up all those threads. There was for instance a Dark Wizard of Donkerk inspired game I played, exploring the mentalist setting. Never thought I'd be able to contribute to actually writing a story.

I noticed the activity had receded from when the subreddit was at it's prime so I thought I would introduce it to you guys. Anyone up for a rational themed game? :P

Edit:

Also if anyone is a fan of beautifully hand drawn platformers check out [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/][Gris]]. I've started playing it and I love, love the idea behind it. It delves in the mindscape of depressed girl, the symbolic elements in her journey letting you feel the unspoken narrative.

*** Nothing overly rational, but I just finished Legend of the Galactic Heroes and am now legally obligated to recommend it whenever possible.

It's an ancient (1988) anime about an ongoing galactic war between the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. The two "main" protagonists (There are dozens of named characters, and most of them are developed heavily) are Reinhard von Lohengramm, an Admiral whose sister is concubine to the Kaiser, and Yang Wen-li, a Commodore in the Alliance's fleet. The story follows the two men on opposite sides of the war as they rise through the ranks in pursuit of their goals.

As far as being rational, it's pretty solid. Everything that happens has a cause and effect relationship with the rest of the plot. Almost all characters have agency and use it to try to achieve their goals. Some characters in the first season and early second hold the Idiot Ball, but it's acknowledged and justified, and the morons are weeded out of the story by the end of the first quarter (it's 110 25-minute episodes).

Its only flaw is its length. 110 episodes aren't enough.

*** ... what do you like?

- Jane the Virgin: hilarious comedy, four seasons, planned (and satisfying) ending - characters all act rationally. The premise is that a woman who is saving herself for marriage accidentally gets artificially inseminated during a pap smear. So yeah... It is a parody of telenovela tropes, though, so everyone does have a twin brother and science works... differently, but within the scope of that, the characters are real, sympathetic, and, again, rational. I also like it because the family is catholic but nothing in the show comes across as cringy/preachy/etc (and I say that as a former president of a campus atheist society).

- Brooklyn 99: Another hilarious comedy about a New York police precinct

- The Handmaid's Tale: not especially rational, but critically acclaimed and with good reason. Distopian near-future sci-fi

- The Good Place: everyone here loves it, and with good reason. It's a comedy about the afterlife, but it's also about philosophy.

- Crazy Ex-Girlfriend: a musical comedy. It's hilarious, but also deals with some big topics

- Sense8: A netflix series that got two seasons, was cancelled, and then the fan outrage made them finance a movie. It's by the guy from Babylon 5 and the Wachowskis. Premise is 8 people from different walks of life suddenly become a sort of hivemind, and use each other's talents to improve their own lives and of course to fight the Evil that is Taking Them Down. Wonderful ensemble cast who you really care about and some really cool munchkining of their respective powers

*** HBOs Watchmen is a piece of art, and just completed.

Knives Out is in theaters, and stellar exemplar of the murder mystery genre, that plays fair. (Also stacked to heck and gone cast).

Person of Interest, if you have not already seen it. Strong cast. Strong arc. S1 is pretending to be a procedural so CBS will fund them, but it is so much more, and better than that. Complete.

I will add a "Plus one" to basically all of MagicWeasels list, excepting that I must warn that I have so far been unable to complete my watch of the handmaids tale on grounds of "too damn depressing".

If depressing is your bag, Unbelievable on netflix is a dramatization of a true story, and this is my review: "Kaitlyn Denver? I am here with the truckload of your awards. Now please dont do that again, my heart cant take it"

*** Oh boy! I've been waiting for this question my entire life. None of the shows are overly rational, but characters do act consistently with their values and their implied conception of the world. All descriptions are spoiler tagged because I typically like to go into shows knowing nothing about them. Shows are ordered from most to least enjoyed.

- Dark fuck, idk how to explain this one. Time travel and you'll likely need family trees? A never ending war, it's fucking good, but not finished yet liked for complex plot, complex characters, amazing highs when something clicks and you get a certain aspect of the plot, it's good
- Hannibal A show about Will Grahm, a police detective who solves crimes by empathizing with the killers and imagining himself in their shoes, who slowly discovers that his physiologist, Hannibal Lecture is a serial killer. Liked for character development, gruesome set pieces, and non-repetitive plot
- The End of the F***ing World a teenage girl runs away with her boyfriend to escape her crappy life. The boyfriend is trying to get her alone and surprised so he can kill her, as she slowly wins him over Liked for character development, dark themes, simple and well executed plot Haven't watched the second season yet though.
- The Americans It's the 80's. The show follows deep-undercover Communist spies who look, and act just like Americans as they try to juggle blending in, with spying on behalf of Russia Liked for dark themes, simple and well executed plot, audience-winning over factor, and the indescribable
- You A terribly self-deceiving book lover becomes infatuated with a girl, and does everything he can to win her over Liked for dark themes, simple and well executed plot, audience-winning over factor (where audience roots for protagonist despite the terrible things they are doing)

** Nocturne for a Dangerous Man by Marc Matz is an older book but it is surprisingly rational. It's about a guy with exceptional talents who has dedicated his life to rescuing people. The thing is, his exceptional talents were acquired by exceptional dedication rather than by chance. The book is about one mission, and the bulk of the book is about investigating and preparing for it. As a bonus, I also found it entertaining.

*** Going to recommend [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html][Lord of the Mysteries]] again, a English translated webnovel by a Chinese writer, with one of the more interesting and internally consistent magic systems of the series I've read thus far. Here's a basic introduction:

There are 22 pathways of power which requires the individual to drink potions made from monsters, increasing in potency as well as danger to the drinker the lower the 'sequence' (the most diluted potion and the starting point is sequence 9). Each potion modifies the drinker on a genetic level, granting them superhuman powers similar to the monsters the potion is made from. The drinker must then accept and master the superhuman powers ('digestion') or lose control, devolving into semi-monsters themselves.

After drinking a potion from a pathway, the individual generally can no longer drink potions from other pathways. Drinking the same potion again strengthens their abilities at that sequence but also increases the chance for them to lose control, while drinking potion from the next sequence (e.g. 9 -> 8) promotes them in power as they become less and less human.

There is at most one God at the end of each pathway.
