** As hilarious as this was, and it really was good, I think by now Harry's learned enough about abusing Time Turners to not do something this obvious.

*** You're probably right. Honestly, it doesn't even need the list on the inside of the book - Hogwarts Library books most likely don't even have that. And then the explanation of Hermione having already read the book because she's Hermione still makes the perfect cover-up, so Harry's Time-Turning wouldn't be apparent. I mean, what he did here still isn't even close to being impossible-without-a-time-turner like The Incident With His First Potions Class, and The Incident With The Remembrall.

**** The Recursive Literary Labyrinth--AKA the Tale of the Three +Brothers+ Readers

Once upon a time, someone wrote a fanfiction of Harry Potter. It was really good. Then someone wrote a fanfiction of that fanfiction, which was decent but not quite as good as the first fanfiction. Then someone wrote a fanfiction of THAT fanfiction, in the style of the "How it should have ended" Youtube series.

After it was finished, one of the readers noticed it was a double-recursive fanfiction (triple-derivative literary work), and asked, "Can we go any deeper?" He did not know if it was possible because he had never seen that many recursions in one story, and the very idea seemed confusing to him. And so the first reader was lost in the infinite pages of the Recursive Literary Labyrinth.

The second reader saw this, and vowed to make it to the end of the labyrinth without getting lost. He knew of a story that had just as many recursions as the one referenced in the original post, and he was certain that he could make it farther. And so he told a tale about a story he had read which was thrice derived (doubly-recursive fanfic). The moral of his tale was "Just go one deeper" But the moral of his story was flawed. He knew on some level that if a story could be double derived and triply derived, that surely it could be derived four times. However, he did not truly understand why that was, for if he did, he would not have said to just go ONE deeper.

The third reader saw this and stared in pity and shock. After seeing the last two readers get lost in the Labyrinth, he knew what he had to do. So he huffed and he puffed and he ran through the labyrinth at approximately 60-70 words per minute, only stopping to catch his breath and think. The Labyrinth was clearly infinitely recursive; that much was obvious almost from the moment he entered. The question was how to convey that fact to others, so no readers would ever get lost in the Recursive Literary Labyrinth again.

For a second he wondered, "Is it even possible? How can I write an infinitely recursive fanfiction if I don't have infinite time?"

And that's when he realized. He smacked himself in the forehead.

"Time. Of course! I don't need an infinite word-count to have an infinitely recursive fanfiction, just an infinitely long plot. All I need is some sort of shorthand to represent an infinitely long plot that references itself at ever increasing levels of recursion! That way it's an infinitely recursive fanfiction of itself. Fortunately, I already know how to do that from a book I read when I was a small child, "the Stinky Cheese Man", which incidentally was a collection of nursery-tale fanfictions. I'll abuse my time-turner plot device just like Harry James-Potter-Evans-Verres did in "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" as well as my fourth wall breaking powers. Hey! Sailor_Vulcan! I know you can hear me up at Level N-1, since I'm an author avatar of yours, after all, and share your username. I need to go back in time to the point before anyone entered the Recursive Labyrinth in this subreddit, so I can record what happens in my computer, which is hooked up to a Mirror of Noitilov that translates everything I write into an actual universe within itself. Can you please write me doing that?"

Sure thing.

"Thanks!"

And so the third reader, Sailor_Vulcan turned his time turner three times and apparated to his room, grabbed his computer, his flying broomstick, his invisibility cloak (ripped off from Harry Potter himself) and his magically shrunken Mirror of Noitilov, and apparated to a spot several pages above the entrance to the labyrinth. He shrugged the invisibility cloak over himself, pulled out his computer and the magically shrunken MIrror of Noitilov. Balancing his computer on his left knee, he cast a wordless wandless engorging charm (What!? He's an author avatar, he's allowed to do that!) on the mirror of noitelov connected to his computer, using the remnants of the broken fourth wall as the magical energy source to keep it high in the air. Then he waited, watched and typed, knowing that for the rest of eternity he would have to use the remains of the infinitely long fourth wall to periodically cast an engorging charm on the Mirror of Noitilov, so that the mirror would never run out of space for recursions.

And as Sailor_Vulcan watched from high above, one of the readers noticed that the story referenced in the original post was a double-recursive fanfiction (triple-derivative literary work), and asked, "Can we go any deeper?" He did not know if it was possible because he had never seen that many recursions in one story, and the very idea seemed confusing to him.
