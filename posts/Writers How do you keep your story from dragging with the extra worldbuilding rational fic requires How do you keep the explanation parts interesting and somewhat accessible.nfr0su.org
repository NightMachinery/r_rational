I'm new to rational fic, and trying to write a constructed-world hard fantasy. I'm going to be serializing it, but I'm writing as much as I can in advance. (In case it helps, it's modern fantasy, with tech but no game elements, but I don't think this is a genre-specific problem and it can pop up with any rational fic.)

There are magic, shootouts, chases, and explosions, but they're relatively few and far between compared to most web serials I've read. So the story feels like it's moving at a glacial pace.

In addition to having an entire alternate world to build and establish the history and rules of, there's an ensemble cast whose motivations and thoughts are all explored. It seems like rational fic requires a lot more explanation of not just why characters take certain paths, but why they can't or don't take the others that would end the story quicker. A lot more patching of plot holes. That means there are a lot of conversations and slow passages of characters exploring their location, monologuing, or talking to each other.

Some of my favorite pieces of media ever are like this: The Wire, Chernobyl, Discworld, and certain true crime books come to mind. But I keep thinking, "Yeah, but my story isn't those, and my readers are a going to get bored." It doesn't help that a few people who read the draft of the first arc (14k words) also complained that it was slow-paced.

Static talking heads scenes in fantasy have always been one of my pet peeves. It's always driven me up the wall when characters spend chapters talking about the world and magic system instead of actively exploring and experiencing them. So seeing a lot of them pop up in my own work has been distressing. But at the same time, I feel like putting in pointless action scenes would dumb it down and actually distract from the point of the story.

I know that still being in first draft means I have a lot of time to address these. So, those of you who write RF, what are some ways you've found of keeping a story interesting, and feeling like it's moving forward, without action?

Or alternately, how do you warm audiences up to the idea of reading a slower-paced, headier serial?


** Trust the reader to be intelligent, you do not need to explain how or why something is happening in the moment.

You don't need to tell the reader about why you can cast ice magic with only your right hand, and why it is considered rude to challenge another to a duel an hour after mid-day.

That is not to say you are absent an explanation. Those explanations do not even have to be rational or logical, plenty of cultural items are not. For a rational story only the main character(s) need be rational in their approach.

To avoid being dry though, you must be internally consistent. Especially if you want the story to be lauded as rational.

Take Lord of the Rings as the perfect example, Tolkien was wordy, but even so he cut a heck of a lot out of his stories to keep them clear and concise, but consistent. The whole history of his world, the reasons for many thousands of things, languages, kingdoms, backstories, was enough information to be compiled into a whole other novel (Simirilian).

Writing is a balance and it is too easy to fall into one extreme or another. Describe everything at once, so you know the reader has the explanation but is bored to death, or describe nothing because you have not thought of it yourself and simply want a less boring scene.

Give enough information to make the reader try and figure out the reasons for things. When you do answer, do so later when it makes sense to bring up the other point. You cast ice magic with your right hand to keep it away from your heart, so the mage with only a left hand keeps a hot plate over his chest to keep casting ice.

Trust the reader, and don't build something for too long, as people's own ideas will invariably be better to them than anything you eventually describe, like Medichlorians.

This isn't even true. The characters just have to be consistent with the type of people they are.

** You don't need to explain the mechanisms to be rationalfic. As long as you /know/ the mechanisms, and keep them in mind while writing, you can probably get away with very little actual explanation except when someone is trying something that relies on the world working one way instead of another. The world's mechanisms can be a [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries][solvable mystery]] rather than outright shown.

This is in some sense a corollary of the conjunction of rationalfic with the rule of writing good stories which states "First, go through and write just the scenes you are most excited about writing. Second, stop there, take what you have, and publish it without the rest."

** Explain as little as possible, only when it makes sense that there would be an explanation in-universe. "Show; don't tell," to be cliched. Emphasis on the "don't tell"; be consistent enough, and the part of the audience who cares will start to figure things out, and the part that doesn't either won't mind or wouldn't have gotten far enough in the first place.

I'm trying to think of a fantasy epic I've read that was explicit in its worldbuilding, and I'm struggling to think of anything other than /The Silmarillion/, which was explicitly the worldbuilding companion to LotR. The world just kinda builds itself, as the characters go about their business. Foreshadow aspects that the audience needs to know are available as potential problems or solutions, but the audience doesn't /need/ to know everything to understand the story. If the audience is interested in the 90% of the worldbuilding that inevitably can't fit in the story proper, that's what appendices are for.

(Now that I think of it, /The Wheel of Time/'s starting each book with a fluffy establishment paragraph following some wind might have been a stealth way to draw parts of the map. I mostly just built a mental map of the world as the characters traveled and heard rumors of distant happenings, more than from the winds, though.)

The key point here is: what does the audience /need/ to know? You need to know far more, to get the pieces set up properly, but people in our world don't typically know anywhere near enough about our actual world, or its actual magic systems, and still get by. Maybe the trouble is that those of us who do learn rl lore tend to do so from dry exposition in textbooks and classes, rather than through experience? (It's hard to show rather than tell when it comes to ancient history, after all.) But again, what does the audience /need/? In HPMoR, we don't see Harry and Hermione in class very often, or read summaries of what they read in their textbooks. We see them do experiments, and hear Harry's thoughts as he's considering character backstories, and we especially see Harry get frustrated by how confusing it all is, and get in trouble for misuse of munchkinry. HPMoR gets away with less explicit (and more subtle) worldbuilding than canon /Harry Potter/, partly for being fanfiction, and partly because of its different focus. When we do get infodumps, it's usually either in a classroom context, or Harry giving a lecture about some article he remembers reading. And the most memorable of those tend to be wrapped in character interactions or strong emotions (Quirrel, MacGonogall, etc).

I think, one of the things that broke my attempt a few years back at rationalifying my soft sf novel was how making the plot and character actions make sense shoved the important information back so far, it felt like the reader would have been jerked around and felt deceived about where it all was going. The trick is to establish at least enough in the first paragraph to know what kind of story they're getting into, and if there are big twists that would break those promises, hint early. (Ex, /Leviathan Wakes/ is mostly hard science fiction, but a major plot point gets kinda eldrich and horrific and involves lots of handwaving. If this had happened without warning in the middle of the book, it would have felt very out of place and like it broke the promise of the setting. Since the prolog showed us a brief sample, thenshoved it back into the mystery box, it fit much better when we finally got back to it.)

** Frankly a lot of it is just practice. You learn how to implement explanations smoothly into the flow of events by trying to do it and seeing what works and what doesn't.

In terms of specific advice, I'd say try and mix the explanations into conversations and interactions between characters. It's much more interesting to learn lore as a result of two characters talking about the issue, or planning something, or dueling, than to read a paragraph of lore that just establishes context in abstract.

** What great authors are able to do is incorporate aspects of the world, history, rules of magic, etc, into the plot of the story itself. Make that info essential for the characters to solve a problem or win a conflict, and suddenly your reader will be invested in learning about the world you've created. Again, this is hard to do and takes lots of practice, but it's a good thing to think about when writing.

Also as others have said, don't feel obligated to dump everything at once. If the world is well-realized and detailed, your readers should be able to tell and will trust you even if you don't explain everything at once. In fact, mysteries and hanging questions are a great way to hook a reader. Same goes for character decisions. Obviously I want to know why a character acts a certain way, but don't get bogged down in explaining every possible path. Maybe try to cover egregious plot holes but smaller stuff can be slipped in later and will be noticed by readers who are detail-oriented and care about that sort of thing.

** Your story drags whenever the audience doesn't care what's going on. Therefore, the most important thing the story can do not to drag is to raise interesting questions to pique your audience's curiosity. /What does *that* mean? Who could have done *that?* Why would she have done *this?*/

If you never answer any of the questions, you'll lose your audience as they realize your mystery box is actually empty. So, you need to have answers to the questions.

In addition to outlining the sequences of events that made up the main plot of OCTO, I had separate notes for each character keeping track of where they were, what their current goals and obstacles were at each stage in the story, and what direction they were heading next.

From there, it was a matter of revealing things to the audience by following the perspectives of the characters positioned to discover those things, and raising questions naturally by virtue of the characters' limited perspectives.

I'd recommend building in some randomness, doing a lot of research, and listening to your gut when it /feels/ draggy. And get beta readers who are generous with feedback.

This is interesting. One other complaint I tended to get when I included this was that the beginning was confusing or had too many loose ends. So maybe part of my problem was conflicting feedback or readers who weren't in my audience as well.

I'm trying to incorporate more fair play mysteries into the story, though.

**** Someone recently linked Kaj Satala's summary of the idea of chaining hooks. The idea goes that you create an interesting situation with a question that the audience wants answered, and then you answer it. One should include many of these,, because to keep the reader engaged, questions do need to be answered quickly, but there need to still be questions left to keep them moving forward. This doesn't necessitate lore dumps, necessarily; careful arrangement of the content so that the confusing parts serve as the hook, and the next sentence resolves the confusion, can work in some cases. There should generally always be at least one set of parentheses open, but it helps to have other sets that open and close quickly, overlap, etc, to keep the reader's curiosity both engaged and trusting.

** "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you'll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball."

** When you write the character stories, do you tell the reader right away that the MC's father is still alive out there? Or do you dangle that plot point and possibility, place foreshadowing, and when the right moment comes, reveal it like a stage magician?

Yeah. Do *that* for the worldbuilding.

You're treating the worldbuilding as a requirement to enjoy the world. Instead, treat the worldbuilding as the enjoyment itself.

Give hints and let them play with the worldbuilding and come up with their own ideas first. Let them speculate, and slowly connect the dots. When you finally reveal how X, Y, Z part of the world is really like, it shouldn't come as a surprise to the reader. And it should be something the readers feel *excited* to read about.

Ergo: Don't treat your world like it's the table for your card game, treat it like it's a few dozen extra cards in your hand to play instead.

** I'm writing a rational urban fantasy paranormal romance with intense worldbuilding and whose main conflict hinges on a pretty standard philosophical problem (deontology vs utilitarianism).

It's... basically all talking heads? The characters talk to each other a lot because it's about their relationship. There's action (vampires! Mysterious injuries! Kidnapping! Intrigue! Implied murder! COMPETITIVE TOWEL FOLDING!), but it's not the main point because that's not what my story is /about/. The worldbuilding doesn't come up except in what the characters have in their immediate environment.

And what's wrong with that? Your story is about what it's about. It's an ensemble cast so let the ensemble sing.

Some techniques for getting a story off the ground to a running start might help you, since you want to hook the reader in long enough for them to warm up to the cast. Things like /in media res/ and then flashbacks, starting small and then expanding, etc.
