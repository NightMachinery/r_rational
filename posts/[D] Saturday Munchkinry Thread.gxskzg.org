Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** The vast domain of a dark god has three laws.

- The Law of Hunger: Plants do not grow here. Fungus and animals are fine - if they can find food.

- The Law of Gloom: The domain is in perpetual shadow. Total darkness is unknown, but even a blazing bonfire is reduced to a muted glow. There are no stars.

- The Law of Fertility: The god and its offspring can, and often to. interbreed with anything.

I'm looking for a few things in the above situation.

- What does it look like when a kingdom falls into this domain? What about a world?

- How would people adapt to living in this situation? How long could they reasonably last?

- How could people eat? I'm thinking some photosynthetic livestock created through extraordinary means, such as interbreeding god-blooded creatures with E. chlorotica (sea slugs with chloroplasts). What vitamin deficiencies would need to be addressed?

Thanks in advance and have fun with this. :)

*** First thing to consider is what a plant is at the most fundamental level, because in some ways it's subjective, based on arbitrary classifications come up with by humans. I can imagine a community devoted to spreading the idea that plants as a concept don't actually exist, and sessile organisms are all just different kinda of fungi or edible rocks. I don't expect that this would /work/, but the idea of it being tried is funny.

Assuming that plans along that line don't work, first thing to consider is that ecosystems need input energy - even on earth it isn't a closed system, due to sunlight, but sunlight isn't the only option. I don't know if the Law of Gloom functions by removing energy or just slowing down light-producing reactions, but in practice it means that a different input energy will be needed, since any biology that needs or produces light is going to be incredibly inefficient. Around the edges of the domain, I could see herbivores eating outside of it during a period of the day, and making their way back inside at night, but that might not be advantageous.

Underwater heat vents are the first thing to think about. Life on earth may have even originated around them. Depending on how 'hard' you want your world's physics to be, I could see this being expanded to fungi or algae colonies growing by volcanoes, feeding off of the heat. That would then be the start of a food web.

Your next option would be some sort of lithovore. We have bacteria on earth that feed in this way, though the process is incredibly inefficient. Sprinkle in a little magic, though, and you may have the potential for oasises of fantastical creatures around mineral deposits, with sapient settlements being built due to their dual purpose of mining and agriculture.

Next idea is a little bit more weird. It relies on the Law of Fertility. If the God and its offspring can breed with anything, that probably means that some meat-moving has to occur along the way, right? I'm imagining creatures that fertilise themselves, and make use of the free energy that comes from this having to succeed in order to feed. Like fungi that grow bundles of spores, seemingly out of thin air, only to consume them. Depending on how elaborate and generous this process is, it could result in grotesque megafauna who have tons of excess energy to devote to being as terrifying as possible.

Then, of course, if your world has magic, I presume these areas are soaked in it. If magic is stylised as energy, then that's energy that can be harvested. Depending on specifics, you could have mage molds that constantly cast Create Food and Water inside their own stomachs using the magic in the air, or some equivalent of that. This also depends on how promiscuous the God's offspring are.

People... Probably aren't gonna do well. All the suggestions I've made here would require a lot of time, presumably, before they became reliable food sources, not to mention questions about toxicity. People also very the majority of their vitamin D from sunlight, but that could theoretically be fixed with a diet disturbingly high in the stuff, or a quick fix to a defunct gene. But the problem, in the end, is that on our planet, photosynthesis is by far the most efficient means of gathering energy without consuming other organisms, so of course most creatures will fill that niche. By having an area that destroys that niche, you have an area where agriculture is destroyed, unless people predict that and create much worse farms in advance.

Still, I think all of that is a challenge to overcome rather than something unfortunate. I hope this helped a little either way!

**** Thanks for the thoughtful reply!

I'll expand on the Law of Gloom a bit. While the most obvious effect is light, this also works on other energies and energy-like things such as magic, which does exist in this setting.

Magic is beholden to the Laws of Gloom and Hunger. It cannot be used to summon food without some form of sacrifice. The sacrifice could be something normally toxic - it simply needs to be alive.

Death of complex beings, especially those with innate magical ability, increases ambient magic. Over time, though, the magic disperses or is used up. There is no wellspring of magic. The same is true for volcanoes or other forms of geothermal energy. Fossil fuels, uranium and such mostly work as expected. The heat and radiation from these rapidly fade as they travel from their source due to Gloom.

***** It seems there should be some way to turn the Gloom's dispersal of energy-like phenomena into free energy. At the very least, it can act as a heat sink to Carnot engines. What sorts of quasi-energy can magic create? Are chemical energy gradients dispersed by Gloom? Maybe you could magically raise or lower the pH of a body of water at one end, let the gloom disperse it across the body of water, and then get some type of chemovore living off the difference that makes more magic when it dies than was required to feed it?

Another though... what counts as death in the case of organisms like fungi? A hive organism could strategically kill parts of itself to generate magic that in turn feeds chemical reactions that can be used for energy. Like a slime mold that periodically kills half its own cells but generates energy in the process or an ant colony that sacrifices members for magical energy to feed a symbiotic fungi.

****** Gloom is intended to be very much akin to the third law of thermodynamics. The notion is that there is an underlying medium to the realm of the god that constantly disperses minute quantities of energy. A room, completely sealed off from its surroundings, should be pitch black, but Gloom will cause it to have dim lighting, albeit at the cost of light, magic, and other nearby energies.

Potential energy, especially chemical energy, doesn't tend to be affected by Gloom. When you burn something, the heat will get absorbed/dispersed somewhat more rapidly than normal. If you want to get the most efficient use of this energy, you need to do so from up close.

Death of complex creatures is what matters for mana. For the purpose of discussion, consider the benefit to line up closely with the increase in entropy caused by returning a creature to uniform distribution of heat and elemental composition.

I like the idea of the hive creatures that sacrifice components quite a bit! That aligns nicely with the god's personality and goals.

*** My first thought is that you're better off living at the edge of the domain so you can eat whatever animals wander in from places with actual plants.

I was suspicious about the ability for photosynthetic animals to actually feed themselves, so here's the numbers I managed to cobble together from Google:

- [[http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Calories_per_acre_for_various_foods/][1.1 million calories per acre of beef at 1000 calories per pound]] means 1100 pounds of beef per acre. Also note the feed conversion rate of 8.

- [[https://extension.sdstate.edu/how-much-meat-can-you-expect-fed-steer][A cow has about 500 pounds of beef in it]], so that's two cows.

- Your cows photosynthesize, so they don't need to eat, so you can skip the feed conversion ratio. So an acre is enough for 16 photosynthetic cows.

- This means a photosynthetic cow needs a surface area of 1/16 an acre to feed itself. About 250 square meters. Note that an animal this big would have higher calorie requirements than a cow.

**** Nice numerical breakdown!

I like the analyses. Checking in Google, it looks like pigs, surprisingly, are about triple the calories per acre compared to cows. Potatoes are about 16 times the calories - but animals would probably be far less effective than plants due to metabolic requirements.

The light input for photosynthesis would be lower due to Gloom. Even so, the idea of some desperate aquaculture creating calories by raising and butchering semi-divine slugs could work in both horror and humorous stories. I like this!

***** Cows are ruminants: mammals with special adaptations to eat otherwise nutritionally-worthless grasses. They're a very inefficient source of animal protein, and if you've ever considered going vegetarian for ecological reasons but shied away from it, cutting cows (and sheep) from your diet is a good compromise. Personally I just don't eat mammals.

I actually picked them for the example animal because of this inefficiency - the bit where I multiplied cows by 8 comes from there. Pigs only get 3.5. But I didn't run through the numbers with all the animals, it could still come out that pigs are the better choice.

*** A kingdom in a situation like that cannot produce excess calories and as such cannot sustain a large population and cannot support groups of people doing anything other than finding food.

I imagine migration would be one of the first things in people's minds but as they can't see it'd be difficult for those located in the central part of a kingdom to get to the borders.

The second thing in mind would be to gather all the priests and supercharge a god to fight this 'dark' god. Whether it be sacrifices or a debt to be repaid- a lot of things would be better than darkness, godspawn, and lack of plants.

A kingdom would first panic and lots of people would die due to sudden darkness. Bumping into animals, sharp objects, being trampled (being murdered).

Then the food that was available would be whatever was previously stored along with animals that could be butchered

I'd give it a week.

Adaptions would be better sense of smell, hearing and echolocation while eyesight would more than likely either become very sensitive or atrophy.

Perhaps people would find other people and begin to eat them. Or go into the wilderness (read death trap) and try to find and kill things that on top of being stronger and faster than them have better senses of smell and hearing or are too small to be worth anything.

Bodies of water would be repositories of life (read vending machines) so fishing with a blood slathered on a hook or having it shine might work?

I don't know enough about vitamins but people and animals would probably lack fiber.

Godspawn are the biggest issue and perhaps the salvation of whatever is in the darkness. Like godspawn not!plants that feed off of darkness, godspawn animals that are bigger and better, godspawn people who'd have adaptions suited for a dark hellscape lacking plants and host to abominations born out of uncontrollable lust.

A dark god world is very screwed. Godspawn would probably be one of the few things to roam the land. The ocean would be fine though as ocean life already has darkness as an everyday thing.

Ocean mammals that can echolocate would have an easier time as their prey can't see them anymore but not drowning could be an issue as 'where is up' in darkness might be harder to figure out.

*** Say you want to crack a 4-digit password. You try 0000 and send a message back to yourself saying that didn't work. So you don't try 0000, you try 0001 and send a message back to yourself saying that didn't work. Repeat repeat repeat, you try 1337 and send a message back to yourself saying it worked. You actually use this timeline, so it's the stable one, and the only one you actually receive a message from. It also doesn't take any particular feats of patience, since each iteration of you only needs to try one code, so the length of a password you can break is only limited by how long of one you can send back to yourself without error.

This also works on any ordered list. Say a list of arguments you want to try to convince someone of something.

If the messages you can send back to yourself are long enough, you can use it to brute force some mathematical proofs by counterexample. Even longer and you can brute force running all possible computer files of size N as executable until you find something a future version of you finds entertaining.

Not only are you better than any other method of getting vacuum besides literally going to space, but you eliminate the need for a lot of fancy equipment that wouldn't do the job as well. Also, depending on how much focus you need to exert to keep a bubble going & whether there's a maximum allowed distance between you and your bubbles, you could even hold down another job while doing this and retire in half the time (or donate one of your salaries if you're an effective altruist).

As far as actual cape work, the best you could do would be suffocating people (if the bubbles can have stuff intersecting them without breaking) or doing moderately-loud thunderclaps by collapsing bubbles. It's a pretty solidly C-tier power.
