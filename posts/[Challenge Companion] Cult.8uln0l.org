*tl;dr: this is the companion thread to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8udp2g/biweekly_challenge_cult/][weekly challenge]], post thoughts, ideas, recommendations, or general chit-chat here.*

I didn't think that I had any recommendations for this one, then I remembered that /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]]/ more or less fits on both fronts - I liked it a lot, until near the end, but wouldn't describe it as rational fiction, nor would I think that anyone else would (but we have a pending debate on definitions).

I'll also give tentative recommendations for T.C. Boyle's /Drop City/, which features the inner workings of a hippie commune, and /The Inner Circle/, which is historical fiction about Alfred Kinsey and his researchers. Neither are books about cults, per se, but both explore the reasons that people are attracted to and opt into insular communities with their own social norms, mores, and language.

I tend to find cults poorly executed in most fiction, or more charitably, I think their depiction is too often one of fanatics being fanatical for no clear reason, rather than complex processes of coercion, control, and failure states of the human mind with respect to society.

(I've long had an interest in cults, as my uncle was part of the Unification Church in the 1970s before being kidnapped and 'deprogrammed' by his parents.)


** Cult writing is really hard, basically for the Moldbug reason.

To paraphrase, I want to talk to a chick still in its shell about the egg. I talk about a white thing, thin and fragile, that I can shatter at will.

He doesn't know anything about that. He says the word I am using refers to the Wall Of The World, the absolute limit of all experience and possibility, the Pressure That Grows.

Similarly, if I am writing about a cult, I am not doing so to a cult audience. (The cult, of course, doesn't see itself as such, it is simply the only group that sees the World-As-It-Is) So it is going to feel cheap and silly, like watching a magic trick from behind.

It's like writing about a character with a compulsion or whatever. You can be like "Now they must wash their hands ten thousand times", and the reader is like..."Ok, I guess I can imagine what it would be like to do that", but what you want to get across is what it would be like to /have/ to do that.

To grok a cult, or other worldview, I think one must be a participant. Outsiders can only be given the whole picture, and the magic trick lies in what is omitted.

Maybe the way to properly write a Cult would be to write a fantasy novel kind of story, with a miraculous world latent with purpose serving as the setting, only to reveal the true (utterly mundane) outside POV at the end. "The City and The City" does something like this.

Oh yeah, that was a big thing, right?

How did it go for him?

*** Fine. I never got the full details on the deprogramming, but it apparently worked, since he left the church and never looked back. So far as I know, most "deprogramming" is just getting someone good at argumentation to argue in favor of the old value system or set of beliefs, which is more effective than having a vested but inexperienced family member do it.

** There was a fair bit of cult exploration in the Dune sequels. Both through the specific cult of Muad'Dib, and also the more general stuff created by the Bene Gesserit.

The muad'dib cult was interesting, exploring some of the pitfalls of following a messiah, and following it's inevitable downfall. I found it an interesting idea, the active cultivation of cults by groups like the Missionaria Protectiva, through the sowing of prophecies to be made use of by agents in need.
