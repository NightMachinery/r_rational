From the start, I'm new here, so I'm sorry if something similar was posted day ago or something.

Is there a rational edition of WH40K universe?

A story with most of the lore intact, but where logic triumphs blind zealotry.

Some Eldar craftworld want to be allies with IoM? Sure, why not.

Mostly undamaged Tau Hammerhead? Reverse engineer it.

Lost knowledge of Dark Age of Technology tech? Reverse engineer it from what is left.

Excellent stormtroopers? Give them less advanced power armor, so they can fight longer.

A story where IoM does whatever it can to survive, and save the galaxy from chaos/tyranids/orks.


** There is a rational edition. It's the Great Crusade. 40K is the universe 10,000 years after a rational civilization collapsed. The tech priests spend all their time worshipping (i.e. placating) the machines because in the Dark Age of Technology people decided putting AIs in everything was a good idea -- and it was, until it turned out that hell is real and doesn't care about reason. The can't figure out why it works because much of it actively fights them. They had technology worked out to the point they had machines that spit out blueprints perfect for the situation -- and it turned out those machines could be possessed by demons, so they had to destroy them. Blind zealotry triumphs because there are very real dangers to "just reverse engineer it", like everyone in the building getting skinned or Ork spores infecting the entire planet.

Um... there's a bit of a problem with that idea. Baron von Evilsatan put it best (in an admittedly lengthy post)

#+begin_quote
  The Mechanicus does NOT have the technology. They haven't been living on some fancy paradise planet since pre-fall. Mars is a fucking anarchic nightmare shithole the moment you leave the safe zones into the kilometres of labyrinthine corridors beneath it full of rogue machinery, self-aware and malevolent AI from before the Fall, and the daemon programs of the Heresy. EVERYTHING in the databases is fucked. The databases are fragmented over the entire fucking surface, to the extent that it would be impossible to see one tenth of the total files in the ludicrously extended life of a Magos even assuming that they are completely safe to visit.

  The files have been corrupted into madness by the Fall, and the unleashing of the most potent informational warfare systems ever to exist to defeat the Iron Men. Nearly all of Mars was rendered uninhabitable, what they live in now is built on the top of the ruins. They send archeotech expeditions in to find shit, [and] nearly all of them never come back. The sheer number of rogue war machine[s] running around in there is sufficient to rape the mind. Then came the fucking Heresy, which was not earth-exclusive. Mars as the second most critical planet in the Imperium was the site of fighting nearly as ferocious as on earth, with Mechanicus loyalists and Hereteks fighting tooth, nail, and mechadendrite everywhere. Ancient machines were unleashed, viruses both normal and daemonic unleashed into all the computer systems. Nearly every single stored record on Mars was rendered unusable, and those that survived are half the fucking time self-aware and don't like you, or daemonic and actively try to kill you. If you come back with a schematic, it is almost certainly gibberish, and if it isn't, it's probably corrupted into uselessness. If it does come back whole it was probably malevolently fucked with so that instead of a Lasgun power cell it's a fucking grenade set to detonate the second you finish building it. Why do you think they want off-world STCs so damned much if they had them all here? The fucking Heresy is why. Off-world they only have to contend with the Fall's war and its effects on the machinery plus twenty thousand years of degradation with no maintenance. But at least off-world it'll probably just not work instead of actively seek to kill you.

  Why do you think they seek to placate the Machine Spirit? It's because it does exist. The fragments of trillions of self-aware programs, flourishing during the Dark Age of Technology and shattered by Man in his war with the Iron men, imprisoning the few who had not set themselves irrevocably into the machinery, a prison smashed wide open by the Heresy. Everything that can hold programming in the Imperium has a shard of a program in it. EVERYTHING. And you'd better fucking please it or it will do everything in its power to make your day shit. They apply these principles to things without spirits by habit, since they're so used to dealing with tanks that if not talked to just right might go fucking rogue and annihilate the manufactorum before they can be killed.

  This is why they do not like ANYONE fucking with technology, because it is so fucking rare to find anything that just works it is critical [that] it not be compromised. That, and they do not have the actual knowledge to fuck with it intelligently, just through experimentation, which inevitably leads to slaughter. The entire knowledge base of humanity was lost. Not forgotten, but outright lost. Everything at all, poof. Nobody knows anything because the Fall fucked everything up. To rebuild the theoretical framework needed to design new technologies that don't kill everyone near them would require starting from the ground up.

  This gets on to the point of war and what it does to technology. Someone will parrot that it makes it go much faster. Yes, it makes practical applications of technology go much faster. It also utterly stops all research on the scientific theories behind those technologies. This means that when war chugs along for a decade or two things get done. It means when it goes on too long you run out of theories to turn into technologies, and then you run out of technologies to apply. You stagnate. When you have been fighting in a war for survival in a drastically overextended empire, this is what happens. You are desperate for any extra materiel that can possibly be produced. Half your entire fucking military might went rogue, smashed the half that stayed, leaving you with the tattered shreds of a war machine to keep hold of an empire that was reaching straining point with an army far larger. There is no time for the sort of applied research programs that took Man twenty five thousand years to develop, in a time of unprecedented growth and prosperity.

  This is also why the Adeptus Mechanicus insists on cargo cultism. It's because when you are dealing with things you barely understand because everything you knew about them was fucking destroyed it is the safest and most reliable option. The rituals do not exist for mysticism, they exist because they are the most practical means of building, repairing and maintaining the equipment they have with the knowledge surviving. You don't understand why pressing that button makes it go, because the manual tried to take over your brain and the copies are all unreadable and the research base that would let you reverse-engineer it does not exist and cannot be built.

  Why are the Tau doing so well with their technology? Because they had peace. Eight thousand fucking years unmolested by any enemy and they were helped the entire fucking time by the most advanced biological race in the galaxy. Give the Imperium eight thousand years of peace and I fucking guarantee you it will be harder than it was during the Great Crusade.

  You need an analogy, here.

  Build a library, fill it with all human knowledge. You take it elsewhere, but only in temporary storage because you know where the rest is if you need it.

  Now that fucking library goes rogue and the maintenance machinery starts killing everyone any-fucking-where near it. Where the fuck did they all come from, you swear to god there weren't this many, and there weren't because they're using the library's information to fight their war. The government fights a battle that destroys the planet against these robots and is destroyed in the process. The library is level[e]d, cast into flames, every book burned and every computer virus-laden.

  Then comes a man who worked there. He talks to the few surviving library workers, assembles their information, and starts rebuilding a city around the library and expanding it as the librarians find little scraps of paper and fragmented bits of files that stuck together just right read something. They rebuild a library from scrap on the ashes of the old.

  Then the city turns on itself, kills its master, and the librarians turn to rage. Half of them kill the other half and destroy the remnants of the library because where they're going they won't need science or technology. Everything burns, and the city is left to a scattered few survivors, walls open to the world, with the hungry predators circling.

  The Adeptus Mechanicus is the sole surviving librarian, desperately scrabbling through the ashes of paper and splinters of hard drives for anything to help him and the city he needs to survive just a second longer.

tl;dr The universe in which the Imperium has found itself is itself irrational from our point of view. Now, this isn't to say that there aren't places where a rational!Imperium would differ from canon!Imperium, but it isn't as irrational as you may think.

Similarly, unbending zealotry is not /as/ irrational when you are dealing with essentially memetic viruses that turn "An open mind is like a fortress with its gates open" into something less than Pretending To Be Wise and more Actually Being Wise, on the order of "running with scissors is a /really/ bad idea."

*** What about all those planets that get half-forgotten for centuries and re-develop various forms of technology that is most often just scrapped as heresy shortly after the planet is repatriated? What about all the useful xenotech that is outright banned everywhere but in the fringes (where it is banned too but used out of necessity)?

**** They could probably stand to improve there, though it wouldn't be hard to convince me that messing around with xeno tech might cause more trouble than it's worth and the folk on the fringes are playing with fire.

As I said, my point isn't that the Imperium is fully rational, but that it's more rational than many people seem to think.

(I'd be interested to know, though, if there is a history of coming across worlds which have apparently independently re-developed some technology, only to turn out to have been influenced by Chaos at some point in time)

As in, "I tried to make /bleach/, of all things, rational and I'm scared to even attempt this" difficult.

EDIT: although now that that I've spent a few minutes thinking about it, you could start by having the emperor as the rational protagonist, who finally recovers from the golden throne and sets about trying to fix his clusterfuck of an Imperium.
