*** Seems right to me - presumably the Visser will assimilate the memory of the events we've just observed and have a moment of "Oh, the Ellimist was saying the following few sentences in English over and over again!"

Seems like this is maybe a way of making a very subtle move in the Ellimist vs. Crayak game - send a message by communicating it to some totally random guy long before it needed, anticipating that he will get assimilated by the one you're actually trying to communicate with at the right moment.

The Andalites in this fic are such a well done example of the "allied superior species that still lets the humans be the protagonists" trope - see elves and Vulcans. They are so impressive, but at the same time deeply broken in a way that makes it understandable why they aren't even farther ahead by now.

***** I think it has to do with their groupthink. While the colony may have started out with very explicit instructions and a clear understanding of what was acceptable to do, if they were separated long enough that the colony would begin to develop its own groupthink as they were exposed to different environments and incentives. Essentially they would just forget the original rules. Imagine if the American Colonies started taxing their own trade routes in 1760 because they needed more money, or doing something else in their interests that undermined England, except their groupthink was so powerful that they /literally convinced themselves that what they were doing was for England./

I also think it's implied that there is some manipulation by leadership for some reason. This section stood out to me:

#+begin_quote
  They were also outraged. Artem's war-prince, for reasons known only to himself, had chosen to broadcast the unfiltered incoming communications from the besieged convoy on the shipwide channel. They had all heard the panicked cries of wounded and frightened civilians, heard the repeated insistence that the convoy had done nothing wrong, had not deviated from the same course they had followed on a hundred previous journeys, the Hawjabrans had simply attacked, without provocation---

  A part of Artem had hesitated---wasn't that simply how Hawjabran aggression always began?---but the rest of him had been swept up in his fellows' righteous fury, and they came out of Z-space with their fingers on the trigger---

****** Yeah. Adding on to this (the below is spoiler tagged just for people who prefer thinking it through themselves rather than hearing the, uh, author's headcanon):

The key insight imo is that Andalites are /prey animals./

They have the tail blade, and eventually developed intelligence sufficient to outstrip their-planet's-version-of-lions, but think about how deer and squirrels and so forth behave.

Deep within the Andalite psychology is a skittish, paranoid xenophobia that comes from having been preyed upon in the ancestral environment. There was a feedback loop reinforcing "hear noise" ---> "assume ill intent, and defend against it."

Add to that their birdlike flocking---the way they rely on one another for signals about what's safe and what's not safe, the way they cluster together and all move in the same direction---and you get a recipe for very quick "turns."

A bunch of Andalites that separate away from the group fall out of the group consciousness, and quickly become "the other." Given the nascent Andalite tendency to narrativize ambiguous observations as threats, it's super easy to see that they would see weirdness in another Andalite group as threatening and dangerous.

And since groupthink can spread like wildfire, it doesn't take all that many Andalites believing that those-guys-over-there are plotting to kill us all for that to just /become/ the predominant narrative. Everybody believes it because everybody knows it; someone should do something about it.

And so the poor colonists, bewildered, are suddenly smashed with the Fist of God, and even worse---once their territory is occupied and they're surrounded by people who believed they were rebelling, /they themselves/ will tend to buy into the narrative. They won't be fooled about their own individual actions, but they will largely conclude "huh, guess some of my fellow colonists must have been up to some sneaky shit, 'cos /these invading troopers/ sound more and more reasonable and correct the more I listen to them."

This doesn't rule out the occasional /actual/ rebellion, such as the Secession of the Seven, but also actual rebellion is often fueled by the same dynamic! Somebody starts thinking "gosh, the homeworld sure is crushing a lot of colonies for no good reason these days," and that meme becomes locally viral, and "y'know, we should probably like /actually/ get away from this capricious fickle monster that might kill us at any second for no reason at all, like if we're already under threat of being "quashed" maybe we should go ahead and rebel anyway..."

******** It's possible that this line of speculation is silly because God nudges, but... what exactly made the Andalites become intelligent at all, in the first place? In order for intelligence to be selected for, there needs to be an individual fitness advantage. But it seems like the Andalites, unified by thoughtspeak and generally incapable of innovation or independent thought, wouldn't have had large individual fitness advantages to higher intelligence in their ancestral environment (at least, beyond the point where they could support thought speak or where they could be preyed upon reliably by their world's Lion- or wolf-equivalent). Any ideas an intelligent individual came up with would quickly disseminate to the rest of the group, and I don't see the Ancestral Andalites forming separate coalition-of-coalitions and thus needing to become good at politics.

Well, after thinking about it for 5 minutes, there probably would have been selection pressure to be able to generate convincing, self-benefiting memes. “Giving me all the resources is the obvious path” and the like. So insofar as this ability is correlated with improvements in general intelligence, general intelligence will be selected for. In other words, instead of being selected for being likeable or powerful or whatever, ancestral Andalites developed intelligence by selection for the best memelords.

As for mathematical brilliancy, I'm leaning toward God-magic.

Yeah, exactly. There's a fitness advantage in impressing all the other Andalites with your savvy and cleverness so that they let you have the best grazing fields and sleep with you and so forth.

There's also the advantage of smarter splinter groups being able to win the culture war when they encounter and fuse with other splinter groups.

** A possible version of the history of the universe:

Howlers approach ascension through developing hive mind tech, a player makes a move causing the tech to also destroy individuality, leaving them a dumb god rather than a full player

Pemalites build chee and other tech like goodship , chee approach ascension, a player causes the howlers to arrive just a little too fast (chemical in engine? From early interlude) and the resulting extermination specifically destroys the One Who Is Remembered, preventing ascension, leaving the chee as an enslaved god

Andalites are given computer like minds to prevent ascension, serrow encounters an incredibly complex computer and nearly ascends, some move involving yeerks stops it

Yeerks are poised to take andalite tech and ships, have all of seerow's research, and instead a players move causes visser three to fear/hate the sharing, blocking yeerk ascension

In this chapter, the visser has clearly grown exponentially in influence and range, so what move is going to stop him? He certainly assumes one is coming, and has tried to prepare for it almost obsessively. Was it the collapse of alloran and esplin, that will eventually prove fatal?

**** Eh, Tobias points out in an earlier chapter that by the Visser's nature, if he has a quantum virus (or any powerful tech), he also has designed contingencies for its use against him. Similarly, Visser's first response to the howler hive mind is to design attacks based on hive mind vulnerabilities, and his second response to design countermoves against those attacks being used on his hive mind. Hell, he even designed his new body's skin to resist dracon beams like the one he uses!

So I'd be mildly surprised if he's defeated by a weapon he utilizes.

  There was the Secession of the Seven, in which a coalition of colony worlds somehow suborned the commanders of nine whole fleets, declaring themselves independent of the central government.

And then the next paragraph takes place after Alloran's Fall. Maybe this is just the conspiracy kook in me talking, but is it possible this Secession of the Seven happened after Alloran had already been taken? What are the odds Esplin orchestrated the entire thing - and then, bear with me here, then maybe the Andalite military elites KNEW it had all been a plot, but they didn't bother letting the public in on that minor piece of trivia, because the successful quelling of the Secession furthered their "we will crush all rebellion" brand?

I had to jump back to this after finishing the chapter to try and parse it. The Visser took over Artem's mind manually, physically, with a little probe with a "Yeerk" in it - does this mean he's bootstrapping /thought-speak/ to take over (non-Andalite) bodies? That's pretty busted, if so. It's interesting that the /eib/ would keep thought-speak contained like that.

Gorgeous chapter. It's one thing to picture the products of the Visser's machinations on a grand scale, a universe-level scale, but it's a whole different thing to zoom in on it so close and watch how it's guided every step of one person's life. Watching the Visser manipulate Artem is a tragedy; watching the Visser manipulate the galaxy is a statistic.

All the way up to the final, visceral impact the physical Visser himself has on actual Artem in meatspace.

What in the world is he going to learn when he translates the creature's stick-speak five seconds after taking over Artem's head? Was it planted there by the gods /specifically/ in preparation for this moment?

Alloran, Esplin. Esplin, Alloran. The actions of Alloran were not the actions of "The Visser" as we know him, but The Visser as we know him is the Steven Universe /fusion/ of Esplin and Alloran.

My personal headcanon here is that Alloran's early experience with the murder of Mertil something like blackpilled him on Andalite society as a whole. He started treating all Andalites as something like dangerous children, to be herded and controlled and channeled, and /never/ to be trusted or to be vulnerable in front of.

For their literal own good (because the alternative was endless pointless war), Alloran reforged Andalite society back into a single unit. But it was "for their own good" like a not-particularly-attentive parent. He wasn't trying to self-actualize his fellow Andalites, because of a combination of seeing their self-actualization as either impossible, or abhorrent-if-successful. He was just trying to get the carnage to stop, and had an attitude that sort of went like "who gives a shit about their beliefs and values, /they don't even give a shit about them themselves,/ it's all lies and signaling, nothing is being lost if I crack down on memetic drift and at least they'll stop curb-stomping each other for literally no reason."

It's no surprise that this mentality a) allowed him to far outstrip his colleagues in strategic and tactical competence, and b) made him unusually resonant with Esplin, who if you'll recall /came into existence knowing that his parents wanted to tear him apart,/ and had three days to figure out how to make that not happen.

** Wow. Loved this interlude, in general love how much of this kind of worldbuilding is present in the story. While it's always linked back to the central conflict, I would not complain if you started writing/posting interludes within the world, without tying them to the main characters. Especially if it's easier to write this stuff when the main chapters are taking longer, I'm not complaining.

Specific thoughts:

He learned to amputate limbs, but there's an absence within his mind about what happens to an amputated soldier. This ties nicely to Alloran's memories I think? How the path prevents lingering thoughts on concepts surrounding disability. It's good stuff

Confirmation that the Kelbrid exist here (their space is where the One does his stuff in canon) which makes me wonder if the visser is approaching ascension in that direction. He already seems to have the howler hive mind puzzle solved to a massive extent, and he seems able to control at least thought speaking species with his thoughts. Garrets thought scream feels like foreshadowing here, and in hindsight the fact that thoughtspeech can have physical effects on brain chemistry should've been enough of a clue to see this. This interlude really hammers home the visser is only around earth at all because the gods care about the animorphs.

In terms of andalite society, I didn't realize the path was this coercive but it makes sense. My reading is that they've been the aggressor in each war or skirmish that was described, but their hive mind makes them forget their culpability. They kind of remind me of the OG howlers, just straight up erasing the memories they don't like. This all fits with what I've seen of their behavior, and it's so nice to understand their point of view.

Re: the blue guy, I notice that I am confused that the avatar looks humanoid to an andalite, and therefore I've probably misunderstood how physically real versus repeatedly spontaneously created he is. I like his classic design and I like having him be recognizable whenever he appears, but that one is a puzzle for me to think on.

I'm also reminded of the old line “an alien says a word as it is dying, and it is not understood” and it makes me think that just as one of the players snuck visser that note with a howler on it, there's a player that is leaving notes all over the place for eventual discovery by any sufficiently large egregore

My current hypothesis continues to be that the game is about controlling the ethical alignment of the inevitable next creature to ascend. Thus these notes, when finally all combined within the visser, will cause ... something to happen? Itd be nice for all the people and galaxies if it was some sort of friendly alignment hack, but that feels too close to magic.

The point is: the visser is on a scavenger hunt, and he just found another piece. And holy shit the giant howler body is badass

Since the avatar is (presumably) being used to send a message to the Visser, and Artem is (presumably) being infested after the Big Leeran Group Mind Hug from a couple updates ago, it may be that the avatar was given the same appearance it would use with the Animorphs so that the Visser (who would have those memories at this point) would immediately recognize it.

** Great chapter as always.

I might be confused about something, but in chapter 50, Perdão says to Helium, as an explanation for why Andalites never invented computers for cryptographic purposes:

#+begin_quote
  But your species was at peace with itself. The eib had unified you.
#+end_quote

While this chapter presents the Andalite civilization as constantly at war with itself until Alloran intervened to unify the eib of various factions of Andalites.

Wouldn't cryptography have come in handy during the constant Andalite civil wars? Or were thought speak communications secure against other Andalites, and not just against external enemies?

It seems clear that Alloran was such an effective commander because he distrusted the eib due to his childhood experiences (as revealed in the Jake chapter). Was Elfangor effective because he distrusted the eib as well, due to some formative experience? Or was it primarily due to the time travel/implanted memories nonsense?

******* In canon, thought-speak bypasses language barriers, but I couldn't think of a rational reason why this would be so.

In r!Animorphs, thought-speak is still a little magical/under-rationalized. But the gist is:

- Andalites don't use words; they transmit images and impressions and they all share a common "language" there
- Andalites can learn to shape their thought-speak into human words /if/ they know what human words to make, and if they explicitly practice transmitting to human brains. Their implanted translator helps with this; Ax noted suspiciously that his human translator seemed to know more about human languages than it ought, faster than he would have expected, possibly due to Elfangor's previous experiences on Earth or alt-Earth.
- When in morph, the artificial thought-speak mechanism just transmits like to like, so a human generating human-appropriate thoughts has an easy time sending those thoughts to other humans.
- In China, Marco would morph a native Chinese speaker to speak Chinese out loud, or thought-speak in English if he didn't currently have access to a brain that knew the local language.
