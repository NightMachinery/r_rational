Hello! I haven't posted here before, but I wanted to ask if anyone is interested in playing this web serials trivia event I'm doing (featuring 33% Mother of Learning, 33% Worm, and 33% Wandering Inn content). This event will be in the "quizbowl" format. The quizbowl format sort of resembles Jeopardy!-- here's an explanation if you're curious:

#+begin_quote
  The biggest difference between quizbowl and Jeopardy! is this: any player can buzz in during the middle of a tossup question to try and beat the other team to answering it. There's no need to wait for the end of the question to be read. (In other words, a quizbowl player can buzz in when she knows the answer, not just to show that she knows the answer.) This change makes quizbowl really click as a game in its own right. Because any player on either team can buzz in to try and answer during the reading of a tossup question, each tossup question has to have multiple clues about the answer. Clues within a tossup are arranged in descending order of difficulty, allowing teams that know more about the answer to buzz in earlier. (This descent in difficulty is called pyramidality.) It wouldn't be good if questions were only one or two clues long -- every player who knew the answer would buzz in all at once, and it would be hard to tell which team is actually more knowledgeable about the answer. In a world of extremely short questions, teams that know a lot more about the question topics might still lose out frequently due to mere reflexes -- and games would be far less fair because of it.

  So you'll never see a one-clue quizbowl question like:

  "Who went on a Midnight Ride to warn Boston of British soldiers in a Longfellow poem?"

  Instead, a pyramidal tossup might look something like this:

  "This character has a friend who “wanders and watches, with eager ears” until he hears the “measured tread of the grenadiers.” This character gives “a cry of defiance, and not of fear, a voice in the darkness, a knock at the door.” His actions occur on the “eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five,” and are cued by “a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the North Church tower as a signal light.” For 10 points, name this character whose midnight ride to warn of impending redcoats was described by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow."

  ANSWER: Paul *Revere*

I already have enough interest to do an initial reading some time in mid-January, but please [[https://discord.gg/A9bpECWCVQ][join this Discord server]] if you'd be interested in playing so I can see if I should set up a second date!

The event is being organized for charity and entry fees are based on a Pay-What-You-Want system. The charities I'm spotlighting are listed below. Please send me a screenshot of your charitable donation on Discord to participate (and remember that $300 worth of charitable donations are tax-deductible)!

- [[https://www.malariaconsortium.org/support/donate.htm][/Malaria Consortium/]]/: Malaria Consortium provides seasonal preventative medicine to protect against malaria, one of the leading preventative causes of death in the world (especially for children). It costs about $7 to medicate a child, so the return on your donation is quite high./
- [[https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donation.aspx][/Against Malaria Foundation/]] /Against Malaria buys malaria nets to protect vulnerable populations. It costs about $5 to buy one net, so the return on your donation is quite high here as well./
- [[https://donate.hki.org/site/Donation2?df_id=3031&mfc_pref=T&3031.donation=form1&_ga=2.164207039.1219250504.1606684985-1646859477.1606684985][/Helen Keller International/]]/: Helen Keller International addresses malnutrition among children, particularly Vitamin A deficiency. The cost of one such supplement is just $1./
- [[https://www.newincentives.org/donate][/New Incentives/]] /New Incentives provides cash benefits to those who vaccinate their children in Nigeria. As 43% of infants in Nigeria did not complete their immunizations in 2019, this is a pressing concern./ [[https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/new-incentives][/Several studies suggest that the New Incentives program really does make a difference/]]/, and it costs about $47 to incentivize a parent to complete their child's immunization schedule./
- [[https://schistosomiasiscontrolinitiative.org/get-involved/donate][/SCI Foundation/]] /SCI Foundation works with governments to implement mass deworming programs, which provide medicine to get parasitic worms out of children. Parasitic worms infect hundreds of millions of children, and it is pretty clear that they lead to a lower quality of life./
- [[https://donate.evidenceaction.org/give/309055/#!/donation/checkout][/Evidence Action/]] /Evidence Action focuses on a variety of causes, most notably their Deworming the World initiative. They send monitors to facilitate and support mass deworming initiatives, as well as evaluate the extent to which they are accomplishing their goals./
- [[https://www.givedirectly.org/ubi-study/][/GiveDirectly/]] /GiveDirectly gives unconditional cash transfers to very poor families, with which they can spend on anything they want. These cash transfers have generally been shown to be quite effective at increasing quality of life./
- [[https://movehumanityforward.com/covid-relief][/Humanity Forward/]] /Humanity Forward is providing COVID cash relief to the Bronx, as well as pushing for a coronavirus stimulus package in the US Congress and trying to mainstream the idea of universal basic income in American politics. While the return for your cash here is probably a bit lower than it would be elsewhere, this does provide a domestic opportunity to donate (plus promoting the idea of unconditional cash transfers anywhere is indirectly promoting it everywhere)./
- [[https://itif.org/support-itif-clean-energy-innovation-policy-program][/ITIF Clean Energy Program/]] /ITIF is a think tank that invests in clean energy R&D. They focus on a wide range of emission reduction strategies, which I think sets them apart from other similar initiatives./
- [[https://www.rainforestcoalition.org/donations/][/Coalition for Rainforest Nations/]] /Coalition for Rainforest Nations is an organization that supports tropical countries in protecting and incentivizing preservation of their rainforests. They have a lot of pull at the international level (like they were at the bargaining table for the Paris Climate Agreement), which sets them apart from similar initiatives./
- [[https://www.catf.us/donate/][/Clean Air Task Force/]] /The Clean Air Task Force is a US-based group that advocates for climate initiatives and also puts a lot of money towards R&D in underfocused areas. They have a proven track record of getting initiatives through, which can't be said of many similar groups./

Feel free to DM me if you have any questions, and I hope you decide to participate!


** I'm confused about the entry fee. Is there going to be a pot or is this all just a fun competitive way to donate to the charity of our choice?

** For a second I misread one of those as "SCP Foundation" and got really excited.

If I considered myself likely to do well in 2/3, but have absolutely no familiarity with the third, would competing feel pointless?

*** Pourquoi pas? On ne peut pas inclure tout.

Or rather, the more web serials you inclde, the more time will your average participant have no idea what you are talking about in a question.

(Also, OP who might be writing all the questions is likely most familiar with the works he listed.)

** It's interesting to me which web serials are popular and which are not-as-popular. I'm guessing from your selection that Worm, Mother of Learning, and Wandering Inn are the three most popular web serials out there? That's obvious to me with Worm, but I didn't know that Mother of Learning was popular, and I've never heard of Wandering Inn.

How does Worth the Candle compare in popularity? That's the most popular story on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], after Mother of Learning. (And after HPMOR (which has a permanent place of eminence) and Significant Digits, I suppose, but those technically aren't original web serials, I guess)

An [[/r/rational][r/rational]] quizbowl would be interesting, maybe covering Mother of Learning, Worth the Candle, HPMOR, Significant Digits, and other [[/r/rational][r/rational]] standbys. (I admit I'm not so interested in your event, since I've only read Mother of Learning, like I guess some others on [[/r/rational][r/rational]])

*** Alexa web traffic ranks are a pretty good way to gauge popularity, but it's hard because web serials hosted on Royal Road or some other third party are not indexed. In this metric, I believe "Practical Guide" is the most popular web serial currently running, but I'd imagine Worm has a much higher total readership.

Patreon supporters can be a good guide for those Royal Road fics. In this metric, Worth the Candle (369 Patrons), Practical Guide (615 Patrons), and Mother of Learning (634 Patrons) are dwarfed by Wandering Inn's 4,136 Patrons. So while I wouldn't say that this is entirely accurate (no way TWI is 10 times more popular than Worth the Candle), but it does tell you something.

*** Mother of Learning has been the top rated fic on royal road basically since it has been on there. It's not got the most followers (which I think is other rational favourite Delve) but has got very high numbers.

Wandering Inn, as noted, dwarfs pretty much every other web serial for oatreon numbers.

All three have also always been popular on top web fiction, and none of them actually push readers to vote there, unlike some others

** Is Wandering in a finished web serial? I know that the other two are, but I never read that one.

Also, will Worm trivia be only about Worm or also about its sequel?
