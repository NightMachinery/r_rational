*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77bdep/biweekly_challenge_slasher_movies/][biweekly challenge]]. Post recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat here. Post entries (and only entries) in the main thread.*

Per Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Classic slasher films include Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), Victor Miller and Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th (1980), Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and Don Mancini and Tom Holland's Child's Play (1988).

For the purposes of this challenge, I don't think anyone is going to get too technical about what is or is not a proper slasher film, but the common elements tend to be that there are a bunch of people, usually teenagers, who get picked off one-by-one as a psycho killer (or something similar) murders them.

These movies tend to be notoriously dumb, partly because they're (often) low-budget, and partly because the filmmakers care more about the experience of the film over the verisimilitude of the movie itself, and having something scary happen is more important to them than how or why it happens. There are also a /lot/ of tropes common to them in order to kind-of, sort-of justify the plot.


** This is a bit of a general comment about the challenges. I've been participating for a few months now, and I have a pretty clear order of preference for challenge prompts.

Work-focused prompts are the bottom of the totem pole for me. Writing fanfic for a specific work feels a bit like a chore to me, even if I like the work in question. The SCP challenge in particular seemed insurmountable until I started thinking of SCP reports as a genre. (If you think that'll stop me from taking part in the /Worm/ challenge, fat chance! I promised myself not to skip a single challenge until someone else breaks my streak, which means I have to start writing for /Worm/ now.)

Medium-focused ones seem strange as well, though I've never participated in one. In looking through the older prompts, I found an Anime challenge. I don't think there are many common elements between all Animes that translate well to the medium of short stories, so I wonder what the point of that one was. Maybe someone else can enlighten me.

Genre-focused challenges are where it gets spicy. Suddenly, there's a buffet of genre tropes to choose from. The more formulaic a genre is, the less fun is in it for me; it took almost the entire two weeks to find an idea for the slasher challenge.

High Concept (or thematic) challenges are the most fun. I mean, there's an infinity of options with a theme as open as "Eschaton", or "Metafiction", yet they present a clear core to build the rest of the story around. More like these would be amazing! (And yes, if I do manage to get that fifth win, I'll pick one from that last category. Incidentally, is it possible to participate in the challenge I pick a theme for?)

I don't want to force my preferences onto other people. If you like single work challenges, more power to you! I don't have to participate, after all. This is just intended as a bit of feedback, and maybe a start to a discussion.

*** Thanks for the feedback; I don't often get it and normally have to sort of feel my way around what people want.

I would generally agree with your preference order, but try to mix things up in order to offer variety for people who /don't/ share that preference order. Works challenges in particular are mostly "for" people who really like to read or write in those worlds, and generally get chosen at a semi-regular interval from the pool of "things people on this sub have probably had sufficient exposure to".

My general rule for challenges is that I'll spend fifteen minutes trying to generate as many workable story ideas as possible, and then only select topics where I can produce a suitable spread that attack the topic from different angles. (I don't do this for the ones pulled from the community spreadsheet, nor the works challenges, in part because I worry that I might bias the challenge too much in the direction of the things that I like the most. I wouldn't want us to never have a Naruto challenge just because I don't like or know Naruto.)

You're free to compete for your own prompt; /I/ occasionally compete (under pseudonym), and I'm the one that gives the challenges. For myself, my rules are:

- Don't submit until the challenge has been up for a few days (i.e. don't give myself a first-mover advantage)
- Don't start writing or planning until the challenge has been announced for a week (i.e. don't give myself a headstart at writing)
- Use a pseudonym (obviously)

I obviously don't ask or expect that anyone else follow those rules if they're the one writing the challenge, though obviously issuing a /very specific challenge/ for which you already have a long, polished story ready would be something that I would frown upon.

**** Thanks for replying! Always interesting to know these behind-the-scenes details.

No such thing. I will admit that I'm considering a theme which many of my stories could fit into, but I'll write new ones for the occasion :)

I don't think I've stated it often enough: I love these challenges. They're the perfect way to get feedback without a lot of pressure, and I love how they challenge me to think of specific ideas instead of waiting for creativity to strike. (Also, short stories are my favourite form of literature to work in because they can be extremely polished and perfectly focused on one single theme where longer books cannot escape the occasional pacing mishap or excess of exposition.)
