You gain the ability to read minds in the past. You can only read verbal surface thoughts. Nonverbalized thoughts where they mentally refer to "the thing" are not readable. Mental images are not readable. If they are thinking in a language you do not know then you won't understand what they are thinking. You can usually hear what they hear by a sort of mental echo, including what words they hear and say.

You must be physically present in a location to see where it was in the past. Effectively, you travel back in time as an epiphenominal ghost remaining rooted to the ground you are standing on, make some observations, then go back to the present. If the ground you were standing on has shifted since the time you attempting to look back to enough that you couldn't have stood there for the duration ignoring age and collision with things other than the ground then you can't look back from the place you are standing.

Optional Rule (Line of Sight): You must be standing in a position where you can see their eyes via direct line of sight in order to read their thoughts.

Optional Rule: Time continues to pass for you while you are reading thoughts in the past.

Optional Rule: You involuntarily transmit all the new information you gain to any sentient sighted being who can see you in the present.

Optional Rule: You can also see into the past.

Round 1: Time displacement ranges from one day to (unbounded).

Round 2: Time displacement ranges from one year to (unbounded).

Round 3: Time displacement ranges from one day to one year.

Round 4: You can read thoughts in the present or at any point in the past.

What can you accomplish?


** Sure, I'll take a stab at this ...

If I were working in Hollywood, I would pitch this as a police procedural (/she can read minds in the past and use it to solve crimes!/). Then you add in a cast of side characters (/she works with her ex-husband! her colleagues are socially-inept geeks! in the season finale we find out that her captain is a killer but she can't prove it! there's another mind reader out there/ */but he's evil - and sexy!/*) and run it for however many seasons you can justify.

** Personal Gain

It would be a useful power for grabbing personal passwords, assuming that people are actually thinking those and not entering them through muscle memory (or using LastPass). Easy enough to just sit in a coffee shop and get log-in information for everyone that was in there yesterday. Same goes for a combination to a safe - just standing next to one would be enough, unless there was some biometric component.

** Government Work
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: government-work
   :END:
If the range is a single day, you can interrogate someone and then sit in the room alone the next day - that's not doable with a year range, unless you want really old information (though that would still probably be useful for some purposes). The single largest benefactor for your historical mind-reading would be the government, since it would allow them access to a lot of strategic information that they would want to know. Obviously it would make sense to start giving you language training as quickly as possible.

If you can read thoughts in the present as well, you become very dangerous to keep around. Maybe working for the government would still happen, but they'd have to use intermediaries and video communication so that you're not privy to an overabundance of classified intelligence.

If you can substantiate your claims in some way, you might be able to insert yourself into the legal system somewhere, but the power is better when it's kept secret from people - otherwise they'll deliberately think misleading thoughts.

Edit: Oh, and if you make the determination that it's better to be public about it, and think that's a safe thing to do, claim the Randi prize and then go into reality television.

** You can investigate crimes. You could investigate historical stuff, which you could probably get a lot of money for. Although you should probably avoid anything too religious. You don't want to make enemies of the people who trust Jesus more than you.

What exactly constitutes a "location"? Could you stand on a space shuttle and view space? It would be pretty convenient for people to just have to bring you a surface from something for you to use your ability.

You could send messages to the past by messing around with double slit experiments and the like. If you can observe, you're not epiphenomenal.

That's assuming the collapse of the wave function is a real thing, which is unlikely at this point.

***** Nothing, with respect to the observer who's observing it.

Think of it this way: there's no observation that can distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation (decoherence is the collapse of the wave function) from the many-world interpretation (decoherence is the entanglement of the observer with the experiment). So there's no reason to treat the collapse of the wave function as a real thing. So there's no reason to assume that a second observer completely uncoupled from the environment will change what the first observer observes.

You could argue that it's impossible for there to be a completely uncoupled observer, and they must be interacting with the past to extract information from it... but in that case that interaction would in principle be measurable directly, and it would be that interaction that would be entangling the state of the two experimenters.

** Seems to me it's the most useful for the shortest time displacement.

I can be a perfect spy by visiting some expansive hotels day after important meetings were held. I can probably get rich quickly on stock exchange.

If time stops when I'm in the past - I'm effectively immortal, and can probably abuse this to win in some sports (also chess) - I will have more time to think.
