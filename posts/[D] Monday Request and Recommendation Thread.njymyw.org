Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I've been reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30309/descendants-of-a-dead-earth][/Descendants of a Dead Earth/]] and I'd give it a cautious recommend. It's been out for awhile, and the author's on their third book of the series - 110 chapter written so far, updates are every 1-2 days.

#+begin_quote
  In the future, Man has traveled the Cosmos.

  In the future, Man has discovered many other races.

  In the future...Man has no home.

  200 years after the great war that destroyed Earth, humanity struggles to survive; fractured, divided, wanted by no one.

  Until Maggie, of the Tinker Clan, makes a discovery, setting in motion a chain of events that could change /everything/.
#+end_quote

The style is okay. There are a few parts where dialogue is a bit off, and character interactions are exaggerated, but that just might be my preferences. No grammatical mistakes (that I can remember). Worldbuilding is pretty good, with a focus on the MC overcoming adversity using her skills, knowledge, and limited resources.

e: After finishing the first book, I have to revise this review a bit: the dialogue between the ships crew just isn't great. It seems that characters mainly have two settings: angry and smug. It just doesn't feel genuine.

--------------

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42433/peculiar-soul][/Peculiar Soul/]] by TMarkos (who wrote /Grand Design/ and /Inheritors of Eschaton/, which are two other really good stories) is a new story that came out a month ago. It only has 6 chapter up and updates weekly, but what I've read so far is really interesting.

#+begin_quote
  Not everyone gets a soul. The rise of industry and mechanization has sent the world's population booming upward, striving relentlessly for the fixed handful of souls that level armies and steer the fate of nations. The remnants of a crumbled empire fight in a grinding, bloody war against their ancient enemy.

  Not everyone gets a soul, but Michael must - for he is the scion of a lord, and the soulless cannot hold such a title. For five years he has tried to tempt one of the souls freed by its vessel's death. Five years of pain and failure, earning only his father's contempt. At last, one more opportunity to earn his soul has come.
#+end_quote

It's well-written, the characters and story are interesting, the author does a good job of examining character and motivation, but the focus on worldbuilding is what I like best. It feels really fleshed out (or as much as it can be given the few chapters), not just the setting but the history and political climate, and how that feeds into the MC's story.

*** A decent way into Metaworld chronicles, the protagonist uses earth knowledge about venture capital and margin trading to start a very successful business. It's one of the few examples of what you're talking about that I find believable because it isn't "common sense" so much as a good idea someone once had that built on other good ideas that eventually led to the world we have today. But if you would have tried to introduce someone to it from the 1700s, they would say you're crazy.

It usually feels like the rest of the world is holding the idiot ball if it's a simple idea that nobody else has thought of (to me).

Just fair warning though, Metaworld Chronicles has a bit of a Mary Sue for a protagonist. The first 100 or so pages are like reading a kids power fantasy, but then it very suddenly picks up. Still a Mary Sue though.

Preventing genocide is generally considered a good thing to try and do, even if looking back later there were better paths. For what she did know, the risk of The Quileute Tribe be killed as soon as Aro remembered werewolves was huge.

There's also the fact that hidding the existance of werewolves would likely have been justification enough for the imperial coven to capture the vampires for power bottling as they did anyways.

To answer your question, I think you've hit the main ones I'm aware of. I seem to recall HP fanfic playing with canon's memory charms---I'll see if I can find any links later when I'm off work.

Arguably a similar effect can be achieved through messing with time. JoJo has season 4's time reset when certain information becomes known, and of course King Crimson. Though it's anime and not rationalfic, so I don't think it's applied all that consistently. Worth the Candle has some of this flavor as well via Unicorns and the Infinite Library.

** I read the latest Bujold novel, a Penric one. The Assassin of Thasalos.

It was very good! It's certainly not rationalist fiction, but the worldbuilding is far more real-feeling (to me, at least) than the vast majority of stuff I read. She has a real talent at... well, at everything. She's Bujold.

Penric remains one of my favorite protagonists, though he's not nearly at Ista's level (the protagonist of Paladin of Souls, book two in the Chalion duology, by Bujold as well). Desdemona remains the best demon ever to ride shotgun in a POV character's head, and the Bastard is pretty great.

As always, I adore Byzantine politics, and our return to Thasalos does not disappoint in its delivery.

Highly recommended, read the whole series, it's an absolute delight.

Particularly the two films /A Contact/ (which is an improved retelling of the series) and /Be Invoked/ (which is a continuation/ending and the more interesting of the two). Skip the series unless you have a lot of patience- though I think its been unfairly mocked. Many of Tomino's works could be called pseudo-horror metaphysical weirdness, like that ending of /Zeta Gundam/.

I'm in no way a graphics snob, I love pixel art, there's SNES era games that still look amazing, but there's also some kind of uncanny valley during the 1990s in which games started growing really complex and ambitious while also still lacking the full technical means to properly conveying that complexity visually and the result is a lot of very terrible looking interfaces.

BTW speaking of transcendence and such, /Stellaris/ does a lot of things along those lines. Almost all end game events tend to be really terrifying shit, like extragalactic all-devouring aliens arrive or mysterious entities bleed out of hyperspace after you performed one too many jumps. And then there's the event where after getting in touch with beings from other dimensions, one of them offers you a Faustian bargain in which your civilisation gets a short amount of enormous power, and after that's run out the entity simply kills everyone and leaves you only with one planet and a few pops .

Reynold's /Revelation Space/ and sequels. I'm working through the second now. A grimy, used future civilization has one question: why have they only found the ruins of alien civilizations?

/The Three body problem/ by cixin Liu. Series begins 20 minutes into the future but gets weird, especially in the second book. Occupies a weird space between hard and soft sci fi. Very focused on rationalist topics like x-risk and game theory.

---------

Low fantasy:

Glen Cook's /Black Company./ Mercenaries end up working for less than savory employers. Magic shows up but it is rare, focused on trickery for anyone who isn't top tier in firepower, and tends towards the macabre. This series founded a lot of tropes in later fantasy like Malazan.

/The darkness that comes before,/ first in R Scott Bakker's /Prince of Nothing/ series: incredibly dark low fantasy. The pope calls for a holy war, and the faithful answer. But one character has other plans, and given that he is basically a Dune Mentat, the world is not ready to deny him. Setting loosely echoes crusades-era Byzantium and Middle East, but is founded on some very different history and metaphysics, with sorcery and...other things. Definitely rational-adjacent. Again, extremely bleak and messed up.

And then it's just...not presented rationally? I think it's more in the plotting than in the reasoning. Characters do stuff that /feels/ arbitrary, even if they can talk through a "rational" reason for it. Worldbuilding-wise a bunch of elements feel like they're in there for show (I sawed this cruise ship in half!), which is odd as the first book starts very similar to our reality. The plot is suffused with this weird sort of techno-authoritarianism that informs most of the evolution of the setting. Charismatic leaders draw together factions bound by philosophy instead of material interest, and when they fall, their ideology withers with them.

It's fresh, it's strange, it deals in rationalist themes. I have to give it credit.

See, when I started having the combination of physicists committing suicide, science experiments seemingly coming to a halt, and the whole strange simulation in the unstable star system, my thought was that the simulation was a metaphor for what was really happening, and that the reveal was that the lowest layer of the universe's law was purely chaotic; there were rules, but they interacted in such a way as to be incomputable, and so scientific advancement beyond a certain point was all but impossible.

Then the later two books do indeed deal with some pretty grandiose and fascinating concepts, but they're also full of really dumb stuff. I can't get over the whole part where that guy imagines the perfect girlfriend, then has someone locate a woman that's actually like that and bring her to him, that was offensively idiotic.

As for the simulation, I liked that it mapped directly to the alien's home system and circumstances, but I remember being somewhat disappointed that the "solution" was just doing a big enough Monte Carlo sim. That's a matter of computing power rather than a novel insight, unless I'm forgetting something. Contrast OSC's /Xenocide/, which for all its faults, solves the main plot thread with a revelation about the in-universe metaphysics (the philotic "soul" enabling true FTL travel over the ansible network). Imagine if Ender and company had instead said "Of course! Have we tried sticking /more/ engines on the spacecraft?

The direction you mentioned does sound more compelling than what we got, though it would be pretty incompatible with the rest of the series.

Also, I have picked up the habit of chanting "re-hy-drate. re-hy-drate." when I go downstairs to get a glass of water thanks to the VR game, so clearly that part stuck with me.

***** This subreddit's Wiki lists [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]] as one of "great and highly recommended stories that have a lot of qualities of rational/rationalist fiction". Which I mostly agree with except I'd like to add that the Wiki's content warning -- "Contains torture and mind rape" -- /really/ needs to be taken seriously.

One could argue that adding brainwashing, mind rape, etc to an infinite time loop story is one of the very few ways to introduce meaningful conflict to an environment where death just means an instant restart. However, the implementation was so brutal and visceral that it was something of a shock.

The /Daniel Black/ series is different. It's more of a "base building" game with an added harem. I thought that the base building part was OK if unexceptional while the harem part felt seriously off. (/Time Braid/ also had harem elements, but they were overshadowed by the mind rape subplot.)

I mean, the amount of existential mindfuckery implied simply by the fact that you can travel to the past /and change it/ is enough to make those implications far less than clear. Either:

- time loops are a thing, the past is unchangeable and self-consistent, and therefore if you try you know you /will/ fail, aka probably get killed, or,

- a multiverse of timelines exists, in which case, sure, go ahead, improve this one, there's still untold trillions out there in which everyone is suffering the worst possible fates imaginable, also that awaits you too in the future because quantum immortality, have fun, or,

- there's only one timeline and you can change it, which means that even by improving the lives of those in the time you've arrived in, you're virtually killing everyone who was ever born /after/ it and up to your own time. Including all your family and friends. And it's unclear how do /you/ even exist at all.

Which genre? You'll realise soon enough). It's actually kinda hard to give any specific information since the movie starts with the premise of a little girl being kept at home by an overly protective, seemingly paranoid father, and moves from there as we discover and understand the situation following the child's own perspective. It's nothing groundbreaking, but makes for a really engaging watch, with some clever visual storytelling.

*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/m7a3jl/web_novels_of_similar_quality_to_guide_but/grc5gbp/][Here's a rec list]] I wrote two months back. The last one on the list is the only one not on Royalroad. Other changes would be sticking Vigor Mortis on the list (I think that cropped up a few times in rec threads last month so check those recommendations out, personally I'm torn 50/50 on if it goes in the "Very Strong Recommendations" group or not), sticking Dear Spellbook on that list (basically "Mother of Learning but in a DND-esque world and about a 7/10 instead of a 9.5/10"), and sticking Only Villains Do That on the list (which someone else replied to this same comment with). Also Dead Tired is on hiatus right now, I guess the author is focusing on their other stuff, maybe skip it for now.

*** Season 2 of Love, Death, & Robots is up. Not exactly a lot of rational stuff there, but it's a lot of fun. The exception is Life Hutch, which is both delicious and rational.

**** I really like LDR too, but calling Life Hutch rational is a pretty big stretch. I mean...

- A malfunction which causes a repair robot to suddenly become a killer robot is pretty unlikely
- Said malfunction causes the robot to act like a Jurassic Park t-rex is even more unlikely
- Even if the robot is somehow thrown into a backup "combat mode", having it simply stomp on and smash anything that moves would be stupid, because it's very likely that it would break something that causes second-order movements and thus escalate the robot into a never-ending cycle of smashing things.
- The robot uses lidar or a similar technique to "see" as evidenced by its vision being a depth-map. It would not be distracted by a light source because light projected onto a surfaces is 2d and has no depth.

***** Apparently Life Hutch is based on a pretty old story (from the 1950s/60s, not sure). The limited imagination about how robots and computers could work... shows.

***** My own fridge logic is that the bot was sabotaged. And yeah, the perception thing didn't make sense as shown.

Those plot holes aside, it was a great survival story of a soldier using his tools and knowledge to beat the impossible.

  The Legend of Korra

Uh. I'd recommend the original AtLA over that any time. Neither is exactly rational, but for AtLA it's a matter of stylistic choices and for Korra it's just bad writing. Also Korra is a pretty insufferable protagonist, especially in Season 2, which is the one where everyone in the writing room seems to have lost their goddamn mind.

**** I think Altered Carbon is a great recommendation, especially season 1. The protagonist gets very clever at times, even lying to his employer to frame a rival when the need arises. It has a great cyberpunk / detective noir vibe.

From [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8vzvyk/for_love_of_magic_has_updated_and_harry_now_hates/][what I hear]], that author made his version of Harry go on various misogynistic, xenophobic screeds throughout the fic. Also, it features 13 year olds having explicit sex with older people...?
