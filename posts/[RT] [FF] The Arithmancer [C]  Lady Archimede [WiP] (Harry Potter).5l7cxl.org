** I'm fairly certain that this has been posted before in one of the monthly threads. Either way, it is totally worth it to read.

Not the most rational ever, but I think it counts enough to be here.

**** Thanks for posting this. First time I'm seeing this fan fiction and I'm already excited because it looks promising. Also, just returned from the Hogwarts & Diagon Alley environments in Universal Studio and in the mood for some good rationalist HP fiction to sink my teeth into.

** I second the recomedation, but I think one major flaw the story has (I'm speaking about /The Arithmancer/ here, I'm putting off /Lady Archimedes/ until it's complete) is that it goes out of its way to go through the Stations of Canon, even when seemingly drastic changes happen it still manages to go through the original plot with largely the same evens and largely the same outcomes. So instead of something like HPMOR or HGPRE which turn the story into something completely different by introducing a rational character into the world, this is more of a canon retelling /adorned/ with a somewhat improved Hermione's POV.
