Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I read The Labratory the other week and I had something of an epiphany. In three column format most of the chapters fit in a single widescreen (1080p). Something I discovered by accidentally pushing a widescreen button. It really helped me visualize the length of text needed for a chapter of a punchy novel and helped motivate my writing ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g39t4o/rst_wip_litrpg_the_core_of_a_factory_chapters_15/][shameless plug]]).

It's worked really great. I've written 14 chapters already and am /still getting ahead of my stupidly aggressive release schedule/ (every weekday). What I haven't been able to entirely figure out is why?

Like sure the physical distancing stuff has made me stir crazy, and in general I focus that into work... but that has also been suffering from the physical distancing claustrophobia. I lead with this because it's a plausible alternate explanation and confounding factor. But I did try for two weeks to work on other projects to deal with the stir craziness, it wasn't until this epiphany that I made good progress. Though it might have been a tipping point thing? I find it unlikely. I worry the end of physical distancing will disrupt it somehow, it will be interesting to see.

I want to say that it's a motivation thing. That I saw this amount of text and thought "I could do this". Perhaps because I often write code and have a strong understanding of what a column of code takes to write. I definitely think its because I was able to tie a specific visual to the amount of writing I had to do. But whether that visual is because I find it aesthetic pleasing or is tied into something I had total confidence I could achieve? I'm not sure.

In practice I suspect it might actually be a constraint thing. I look at the word count^{1} as a rough guide to follow this aesthetic (though I do also export and then import it to my ebook reader to verify) and that is forcing me to rewrite, postpone, and cut things that I might not otherwise bother with. It has also put constraints on my chapter outline (vis-a-vis pacing) that I haven't had before. What is frustrating about this hypothesis is that I was aware of this strategy and have attempted it in the past. I'm not sure why it is working this time.

Hope someone finds that useful or at least interesting.

--------------

1. ~1000 < 1100 < ideal > 1375 > ~1500 > 2000. That last being a hard upper limit, the approximate numbers are sourced from the book that gave me the epiphany, and the inner numbers are my page target (5) on royal road. The amount of different numbers might be part of it. As sort of increasing "stress" milestones on my writing. In the past I have only ever tried a single upper limit.

**** That could be another confounding factor. It is however a novel I've tried writing twice before. On the other hand I have also added new ideas - some of them crucial - with each attempt. I don't want to loose the energy I currently have, but maybe in a few weeks I will try it in a different context, that is a good idea.

** Hey, just a notice for those of you who read Pyrebound: I'm sorry I haven't been updating the story. I've been trying to write, but I'm busy with classes lately, I'm not in the best health (it's not COVID), and now my writing laptop is acting up. Updates will switch from "every Sunday" to "as soon as I can get them written to satisfaction." 14.1 is more than half done, probably not that far from completion, but God knows when that will get done. I'm sorry.

** [[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/smarter-you-think/202004/primate-statistics]]

Chimps, and other primates, are capable of looking at the percentage of peanuts vs carrots in a bucket, then when a piece of food is hiddenly drawn from each bucket, they will choose the bucket with the higher ratio of peanuts(which are yummier). Not a very surprising study, it's not a tough statistics problem by any means, but it is nice to get more information on the cognitive ability and predictive ability of primates.

**** I'm not sure, but I think cognitive bias is difficult to research and prone to large amount of error in humans. Personally, I'd argue most biases are actually useful priors and life would become much more difficult if you lost them. So the difference between an useful prior and a cognitive bias would be even harder to determine for an animal.

** I've been replaying through [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/][Antichamber]], and I'm reminded each time of how it's my favorite game of all time.

It a puzzle game with no plot- Just a open world of puzzle with a series of short quotes after each puzzle. The quotes never come off as fake-deep or trite, just cleverly related to the situation at hand.

The music and design create this amazing, dreamlike atmosphere. There's a lot of non-euclidean pathing and surreal artwork, like an art museum made made by Dali. Returning to the start room involves the screen doing a subtle dissolve that invokes waking up from a dream.

None of the puzzles are unfair, though some may require tools you pick up later. And every time I figured out the 'trick', it never felt like I had lucked out.

Great game, 10/10, highly recommend.

*** I think the aspect you spoilered did feel unfair to me, and was one of the main reasons that I stopped playing it. Puzzle games have an inherent contract with the players. The player is presented with puzzles, and is expected to get stuck at times, needing to puzzle it out. The developers, on the other hand, are expected to make sure that it any stalled progression is always the fault of the player. That way, the frustration that a player feels resolves with a feeling of triumph, rather than a feeling that a trick had been pulled.

If a game does not make it obvious that a puzzle requires you to come back later with a new tool, then that is the fault of the game, and breaks the contract. With how many lateral thinking puzzles are in Antichamber, it is quite difficult for a player to identify these puzzles.

*** I feel similarly about the witness (though I also quite liked anti-chamber). Have you tried it?

I know there are some puzzles in the witness that people find particularly egregious - especially given your description - but I actually like those as extreme outliers (even if they may be frustrating for completionists).

***** Well it's made by the creator of braid. So there is that.

The egregious puzzles are all optional. I think you can technically win - and get both achievements - having completed less than half the total puzzles. Only if you want to complete every single one would I imagine it being an issue.

The puzzles are - in my opinion - a very well done sequence for practicing the scientific method (and to an extent I would imagine rationalism, though less so because there are fewer biases involved with hard logic). A couple are more miss than hit, but I would say more than 80% of them are perfectly done given the correct mindset.

*** None of the Magica spinoffs have been very good, tbh IMO. Not a single one.

There's actually nothing particularly rational this season, and we've tried at least a little of everything now. That said, some things are fun. Shows we haven't yet dropped:

- Appare-Ranman! - basically steampunk Cannonball Run. Least irrational thing airing, but that is not a high bar or a strong statement.

- Arte - noblewoman wants to be an artist but women can't be artists because reasons maybe they all paint with their cocks or something idk cute baby feminist anyway

- Hamefura - isekai, mc is reincarnated as a villainess in a dating sim where all possible routes end badly for the villainess. Which is a whole manga genre these days, there's dozens of the things. Opposite of rational, but great fun.

- Listeners - this is probably the strongest show this season for us. Distinct shades of Gurren Lagann, lots of references to pick up on including half an episode set in Pripyat so far. I get the same feeling from this that I got from the first few eps of Madoka - I have no clue where it's going yet, but they've put enough effort in that I'm willing to trust it is going somewhere.

- Yesterday wo Utatte - we don't usually go for straight romance, but this is surprisingly well told, with pleasing characters and decent animation.

EDIT: I should also mention Nami Yo Kiitekure. The other half and I decided it was not for us, but pretty much the entire rest of our anime club are avidly following it, so maybe YMMV. Basically slice of life, people I don't feel a particular connection with making poor life choices. I suspect it works better if you catch more of the jokes, but my Japanese isn't up to that so I'm stuck with the subtitles.

** I've been listening to the music of [[https://www.rustycage.tv/music][Rusty Cage]] on Spotify. I really enjoy his songs.

What I found fascinating is that, if you listen to his albums in chronological order, his lyrics get darker and less religious while his music gets less depressed as time goes on.

This is the first time that I've felt like I could actually follow along with an artist's evolving mentality through the medium of his art.

I thought that was neat, and wanted to share.

*** I'm not sure if it's just me, but Pink Floyd always seemed to be getting less and less psychedelic as time goes by - compare Dark Side of the Moon with Wish You Were Here, and Wish You Were Here with the Wall. I'm most familiar with the Waters-era, so I'm thinking of the contrast between Piper at the Gates of Dawn and The Final Cut.
