I know about Dresden Files, but what else is there?


** [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/about.shtml][Luminosity]] and Radiance, by Alicorn.

While the source material is largely romance, and there's a lot here too, Luminosity takes Twilight's vampiric magic to its logical conclusion in many interesting ways.

****** ... aw, well dang. I enjoyed Worm less and less as time went on due to the grimdark. By the end, I was just... Done with it. TGAB might not be strictly rational, but it was a damn good palate cleanser from the utter pessimism of Worm. I wanted to get back to Wildbow, and I had heard positive stuff about Pact... But if it's even worse (emotionally) than Worm? Forget about it 😥

Not to say Worm was poorly written; far from it! But it just made me personally stressed and depressed. Wildbow's a good author for being able to do that, but it's past my limits. If Pact is even worse/better? Big ol' nope from me.

The main difference is that there are much more moments of downtime, lightness and happiness interspersed between the intense action and horror than there were in his previous stories. So the world is darker but the group of main characters is more wholesome in a way.

***** Shortly after I read Worm, I started reading Pact.

Reading Worm was fine, but Pact was so terrifying that I had to stop halfway through. I only was able to continue a year and a half later, and I stopped reading for a week during the stairs scene at the end.

I still haven't worked on the courage to read Twig or Ward yet. Wildbow's work is amazing, but exhausting.

**** Yeah, but I'm not sure whether I'd qualify it as rational. The whole idea of magic as being based on symbolism and hand-waviness is flavorful, but kind of flies in the face of rationalfic IMO. I just never really got a firm grasp on what the various characters' specific capabilities were, because they were all nebulous by design.

Worm is much higher on the rationality scale, while still being arguably fantasy. I mean, yes, there's fantasy meaning "elves and wizards," but people who can turn into dragons and control darkness also qualify as fantastical even if they're wearing tights and a cape.

***** Definitely wasn't saying it's fully rational, although there are certainly some rational elements---most notably the backstory and classification of types of magic, which is based on careful investigation, although a lot of that is subjoined.

/Worm/ isn't urban fantasy, though. It has some fantasy elements, and an urban setting, but "urban fantasy" is a pretty strictly defined genre, where the focus is on naturally occurring paranormal creatures and their conflicts with humans. Arguing whether it actually is urban fantasy is a separate discussion; for the purposes of responding to someone asking for urban fantasy recommendations, /Worm/ isn't an accurate response, anymore than Dresden Files wouldn't be a good response to someone asking for superhero fiction recommendations.

***** The magic system running on symbolism and conceptual stuff does run contrary to what this sub generally likes to worldbuild, but a key factor of that is that the people treat it like a system that can be understood and interacted with beyond the surface level, even if that understanding is 'this action will appeal to the conceptual voodoo that runs the universe and might help me going forwards'.

It /sounds/ like it should be full of handwavium and plot armor and stuff because it's vague and subjective, but it defines its rules and pretty much plays them straight, so it's pretty coherent in my mind.

#+begin_quote
  This presents a quandary for the ratfic reader, because most of the time, the setting just isn't an equilibrium. The worldbuilding has to explain why the world is somehow exactly the same as ours, yet has this one big gamechanging difference that has no impact on society, on the economy, on politics, on culture.
#+end_quote

​

So I've given this some thought while designing a world for my own writing. You're definitely onto something, but I think it's doable if you make some departures from the typical urban fantasy setting.

- No monsters

- No flashy magic

- Magic was discovered recently and is impossible to rediscover

- Strong magical authority encouraging secrecy

​

No monsters is pretty obvious. If you've got wolves, fae, vampires, and god knows what else wandering around the streets, people are going to notice. There's really no way around that. That's actually okay because there's plenty of stuff to exploit just inside humans -- a villain doesn't need to be a vampire to be evil. You do lose some cool thematic stuff, but most of that's been done so much that it's pretty cliche by now so you aren't missing out on much. Wolves form hierarchies, are overprotective, and fight a lot. Vampires form covens and have human cattle. Faeries are capricious and cruel. We get it.

​

Flashy magic, like virtually all pyromancy, is also a big problem because it's too easy to leak. All it takes is two morons in a public place who can't set aside their grudge and it's all over YouTube. Fortunately, text doesn't lend itself particularly well to flashy effects, so this isn't a big deal as long as magic is still interesting. For example, instead of throwing a fireball (obviously magical), magic could just light the target on fire (still strange, but less obvious).

​

Recently discovered magic means that civilization hasn't had much time to diverge from our reality. I'm thinking something like the last hundred years, and most of that was spent with only a handful of people aware of magic. That neatly resolves the whole impact on science, tech, society, etc. If magic can't be rediscovered (it was a chance finding, it's really really hard, etc) then the only way for the outsiders to learn about it is for an insider to tell them.

​

Authority is important, because in traditional urban fantasy you have a bazillion factions and somehow they're all working together to keep things quiet... yeah, that's not going to happen. But if there's a single powerful authority and a bunch of weaker factions, then the underdogs have a good reason to stay silent. Plus, a centralized power means they can deal with covering up the occasional mistake quickly and efficiently (no politics).

​

But finally, even with all that, I think the best that can be done is a local, temporary equilibrium. There's just no way to keep it a secret forever. Information spreads. Even relatively harmless censored information tends to spread, and magic is something everyone would want once they knew it was real. So keep that in mind and have it be part of the story. The world isn't static and unchanging, it's in the middle of huge world-changing times. There's /so/ much potential for interesting ideas there.

** If you don't mind an adventure/mystery series with a secondary focus on romance, the Kitty Norville series- which is about a werewolf radio host- is a pretty rational take on the setting.

The worldbuilding has a good feeling of plausibility- one of the books is set at a series of Congressional hearings on werewolves, while another is set at a scientific conference on the study of vampires. The characters also tend to be unusually down-to-earth for the genre- more ordinary, generally intelligent people trying to make the best of very strange situations than broad archetypes or cheesy wish fulfillment.
