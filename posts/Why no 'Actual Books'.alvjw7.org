I've not been past here in a while, but it seems that the sub is much the same as it was a year ago - loads of linking to web fiction, low discussion of paid book-based fiction.

I'd assume there's a deeper seam, not only of high quality rational actors, but of flawed books ripe for discussion. Any reason people don't discuss their other reading habits?


** I think it's mainly because this is largely a sub about sharing works, and it's much harder for a thread full of people to all read the same novel than to all read the same webpage.

The other reason is that it's a /really/ niche genre, so there are relatively few print books that fit. Sanderson gets brought up a lot here, mainly because of the way he approaches magic. And I think a lot of hard sci-fi (The Martian and The Expanse come to mind) could theoretically fit, but isn't discussed because of the web-fiction status quo.

*** Stories that update regularly also lend themselves to group discussions more than a book that is released as a complete work, since discussion threads can go up every few weeks, whereas for books there's not really a Schelling point for discussion apart from the book's release, which isn't really a great time to discuss the book since very few people will read a book cover-to-cover on the day or even the same week it is released.

If you wanted to discuss the latest Brandon Sanderson novel, some people might have read the entire thing the week after it's released, whereas some people might take several months to get through it. A 400,000 word Sanderson tome, read at an average rate of 300 WPM, is a 22 hour read. Compare that to a Mother of Learning update, where even a relatively long chapter (~8000 words) can be read in under half an hour at the same rate, which makes it easy for lots of people to be on the same page (literally).

*** Mostly we discuss stuff we want to read. I've brought up things I was looking forward to that we're rational adjacent (The Monster Baru) and promptly panned it probably more than needed as others liked the direction it swerved away (biopunk and wierd karma magic/syncronocity) from what I like about it.

The other half is good hard Sci-Fi is rare or at least hard to find. Something new in the subs interest will be on the page, I'll listen to it before two weeks pass, but it'll often be popcorn compared to some of the serials the sub has followed.

As to the older stuff I'm guessing people think it's been discussed.

All of this is IMHO

*** Sanderson's a great example for 'ought to be the subject of interesting discussion'. He neatly strides over the puddle of idiocy with his world-building foot, then stamps joyfully in it with his 'what are my characters doing' foot. In terms of trying to perform rational-genre categorisation, he ought to be highly divisive.

You shouldn't let your bad first impression, no doubt from him taking over a series you liked and not being exactly like it's original author, stop you from enjoying his work. He's a great author, worldbuilder, with very interesting and creative magic systems.

** First off, a book releases once. It might have 50 chapters and be 120k words long, and it still releases only once. On the other hand, we can discuss updates of things that publish chapter-by-chapter online /every time it updates/. This fosters discussion here and in-depth readings and arguments and so forth - a natural 'book club' effect as we all read and react to the same piece fosters discussion. A book by comparison isn't as amenable to the repeated close discussion and speculation, due to the format releasing the entire story at once.

Secondly, books have a barrier to entry and also tend to have a delay. You have to buy and read the book, instead of just clicking on a hyperlink. People like me might not buy and read many books new, instead getting them from the library the vast majority of the time, or cheaply used / on sale. By the time I've read something by an author I don't know, trust, and love enough to buy blindly on the first day, it'll often be six months or more since initial release - maybe longer. At that point, I /could/ make a discussion thread so that the other people who've read the book can discuss it... but there's not a lot of impetus to do so.

Finally, there're tons of larger subreddits for discussing novels that are 'flawed' (i.e. not-rationalist - though considering things not-rationalist to be inherently flawed is sort of an asshole / pretentious wanker outlook - but I digress). [[/r/fantasy]] and [[/r/printsf]] are great and I read and post both subreddits occasionally.

** I've been here for years, in one form or another, and there used to be more discussion of non-web-fiction stuff; but that's changed for a few reasons.

1. There's a good amount of fiction specific to this subreddit posted here, which is enough to tide people over.

2. The community has matured from the early days---it was formed as a reaction to non-rational fiction, so people could be openly critical of fiction without getting the canned "Just turn off your brain and enjoy it" response, but that's not needed anymore. We all implicitly understand that most fiction is kind of dumb, with rare exceptions. When the community was new there were a lot of those rare exceptions to talk about, but now we all know about them, so all that's left to talk about is new rational fiction.

3. The weekly discussion threads provide a lot of this discussion.

** I think one factor is that people here tend to like works that dig deep into their premise and examine every inch of it. This is more well-suited to longer works (like web serials) than it is for novels. In principle we could imagine a 'real' series fitting this quality, but for whatever reason, there aren't that many that fit into the rational bucket.

Also, mass appeal. People who write real books are usually going for mass appeal, and rational fiction is a bit of a niche.

I suspect a (free) pdf of the book would be realistically necessary for most of people who click on it to read it. (At which point a chapter by chapter discussion would probably be the optimal format)

** In my experience, it's much easier to come across a good webfic than a good book, even when both are equally hyped. I think many who started out wanting to write an 'actual book' need to prioritize /a lot/ on pleasing a publisher so that it gets published. If you constantly have to self-check whether the stuff you're writting fits the publisher's guidlines, whether /publisher would think it's a hit/, editor's deadlines,... what gets churned out has more resemblances to the hunderds other generic book rather than creative and realistic work of fiction.

A wealthy or already well-known author might be able to afford this without loosing much freedom in their work. But I don't think the same applies to small, new authors even with equal writing and creative capacity.

*** Going to have to disagree with your first sentence. The vast majority of webfic, even the webfic posted on this subreddit, would need major editing to make the grade for actual publishing. Second, there is a wealth of fantastic literature dating back hundreds of years - if your only criterion is 'good,' you're more likely to be able to read a new, good book than find a new, good webfic.

There are a few genres and subject areas that are pretty shallow in terms of extant literature that see a lot more treatment online, for example, AI. These also tend to be areas of interest that overlap a lot with 'rational' fiction and crop up here more often.

That said, /Neuromancer/ came out thirty-five years ago and while the AI aspects are only tangential to the main themes, as a work of writing it's yet to be equaled by anything you can find online for free, imo.

By themselves they aren't evil or bad, what makes people bad is if they intentionally cause harm to achieve those things.

***** Limiting access to non-harmful luxuries does not make you a bad person. Could you explain your account of morality here in a little more depth? My interpretation is that you seem to be saying if one isn't a Good Samaritan then they must be a Bad Samaritan. It's a step that needs to be argued to equivocate aid with the fruits of one's labour, just as it is to equivocate watching someone drown with not sending all your non-essential income to charity.

I have a question for you: is it possible to possess /mens rea/ in the absence of any /actus reus/?

If you answer that with yes, I would love to hear an example. If no, I'm not sure how failing to publish books for free makes you a bad person. If you take the third option and deny Western legal tradition as representative of morality, then I take issue with your claim's "obviousness."

******* Your line, which really my entire post was aimed at, was that "obviously" it makes someone a bad person not to publish their labour for free. I know legality and morality aren't synonyms. You've missed my point. Our societal legal norms are a mirror of our moral norms. They're ostensibly aimed in the same direction and at the same purpose.

You can hold, as Peter Singer does, that it's a duty to maximize good by doing as much as possible. But the intuition of most people regarding duty is not so stark; you certainly can't espouse that kind of ethic in a discussion as if it's self-evident.

Maybe a more communal economy is a more virtuous one, but it's not the one we live in. If I can't afford car insurance, is it selfish of the auto dealer not to give me a free vehicle? No. Labour economics still apply to the arts, and your idea that to an artist motivated by money somehow either creates inherently flawed art or demeans the value of that art is a bizarre interpretation of quality.

Lastly, my point about "guilty" intent was only intended as a bit of a thought experiment designed to get you thinking about what metric a person's virtue is evaluated on. I'm sure I phrased it badly, so the following is an effort to make it more clear.

I'm not trying a crime and trying to meet the legal benchmark for guilt. It's more about the theoretical idea of whether one can be a bad person without the intent to commit a bad act. In cases of prevented crimes, the would-be perpetrator still has the intent to do a harmful thing. You can also do harms without or with different levels guilty intent (recklessness, negligence, and ignorance).

However the crux of my question was this: can you, absent an act or intended act, still be possessed of harmful intent? Keep in mind that a commitment to, say, withhold aid or not act is still an 'act' of sorts in itself.

Like, for most authors publishing traditional books, it /is/ their job. They devote all their time to writing. It's how they make a living. I guess some successful authors are rolling in dough, but they are the exception. I think most career authors don't actually make that much.
