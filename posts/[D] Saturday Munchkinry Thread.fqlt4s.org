Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** In exactly 24 hours (or, in a week) your IQ/"intelligence" will be reduced (or increased?) to 90.

The new you will be of that below average intelligence, but they will remember being you and they will remember anything you did to prepare and follow any instructions to the best of their ability (so if you write a recipe for a really good chocolate cake with the note to bake it every day and give it to strangers in the street, then you will trust smart!you had a reason for this and will follow the instructions: but 90IQ!you is below average intelligence and not completely stupid so if there's a huge storm they'll skip it that day). But in general, 90!you is blindly trusting of your advice (and there's no Eve trying to set you astray). Everything else in the world is normal, and you are your normal self with no special resources or powers (if you have special resources or powers, please assume you don't for the purposes of this exercise).

How do you prepare with your 24 hours / one week lead time?

*** One of my partners, without hesitation, said, "I'd kill myself", because apparently he couldn't bare to live as a person of fairly average but slightly stupid intelligence, so please don't be that grim friends!

My thoughts are as follows:

- To get my job at my age I had to be smart, but to hold it I don't, so my priority is maintaining my job

- So I'd write down everything I could about doing my job. I'd probably tell myself to just blindly do the next step my boss says to do (normally I advocate for what I think is right and then I learn why my boss is right / my boss does something more innovative), and to write everything down and then just do the steps one by one.

- Fortunately it's very difficult for me to be fired in a government job so I think that'll be fine in that my income is secured. If 90!me is particularly crafty, ambitious, hard-working or talented she can move up the ranks same as anyone else.

- In my personal life, I have reasonable confidence that as long as my personality doesn't change majorly, my partners won't leave me, and I'd probably include instructions along the lines of transforming myself a bit more into an obedient 50s housewife archetype because a) they'll both be much smarter than me and probably be right and b) it will help abate my anger issues somewhat assuming new!me is really as cooperative with old!me's advice as stated

*** Wait wait wait. So what you are asking is "How would you idiot-proof life?" Can't be done. New me is gonna try the various things that current me does and fail in horrible unpredictable ways. It would honestly have been better if new me had lost his memories, because memories of a smart person are poison for idiots. Small amounts of overconfidence is a slow insidious killer. But new me is going to have a lifetime amount of confidence that has suddenly become overconfidence due to a drastic (heh) instantaneous drop in intellect. That much overconfidence will likely have immediate and disastrous effects. It would not surprise me if he wins a Darwin award.

**** It's more how would you idiot proof your own life with the knowledge that the "idiot" in question trusts you unconditionally.

** You have a voice-based hypnosis power. Anyone who hears your voice is instantly hypnotized to obey whatever verbal orders you give to the best of their ability and understanding. People do not remember anything that happened while they were hypnotized, but will know that the last thing they remember was hearing your voice (though they may not know who you are if you spoke to them without them seeing you). This power even works through recordings, so you can hypnotize people via television, radio, online videos, etc.

However, there is a catch: if a hypnotized target hears any voice that isn't yours, even their own voice, they instantly break free of the hypnosis and thereafter become immune to your power.

How would you use this power? Or how would you fight against someone with this power?

EDIT: Your power isn't blessed with suck. You can turn it on or off at will, so you don't have to worry about not being able to talk without hypnotizing someone. Think of it like Lelouch's power in Code Geass. (This also means it becomes harder for people to immunize themselves, since that can only happen if you voluntarily hypnotize them first.)

*** If you don't care about morality: permanently deafen the target right after you hypnotize them. Now they can never break free. With sufficiently broad orders (e.g. "obey me forever"), you can create an army of deafened mind-slaves this way.

To fight against this power, play a recording of the hypnotist's voice to someone, then immediately talk to them to immunize them.

#+end_quote

I wouldn't, it's too restricted to cause meaningful change in the world, and clashes to much with my morals to use for my personal gain, like there are very few ways to get somebody to do anything without having them hear somebody elses voice, like sure I can get people to do stuff online or sign documents, but I cant think of ways to do this without either catching peoples attention or it being very immoral. Overall the power would be extremly annoying since it would affect everybody I talk to once until they either hear somebody else or I tell them to say something, I would honestly be afraid that people will think I am drugging them. It would also be hard to explain if I accidentally affect somebody in front of people who are immune.

Immidiatly say something to everybody I meet to free them should they be hypnotized, and always listen to music on a very low volume to free me immidiatly but not hinder my ability to hear other, I would only need to do this until I am affected once.

*** the most obvious use is making people kill themselves, or in a fight. just tell them, like, "jump and land on your head". or making them give you stuff, but that probably won't get you much more than pickpocketing would since no one walks around with significant amounts of valuables.

you'd want to find out if something like "decide to become a better person" works and persists past the hypnosis.
