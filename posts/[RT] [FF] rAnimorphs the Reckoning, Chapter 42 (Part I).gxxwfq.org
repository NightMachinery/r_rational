****** As the person who complained last time about the Visser using the fuck-word, I didn't have an issue with him in this chapter. Maybe that's because he's speaking to someone else instead of as an internal monologue, or maybe because Jake notes his own anger at the Visser making a sarcastic joke. Or maybe because the fact this conversation is happening at all indicates he's open to getting some value out of conversations with other sapient beings, and therefore might not want to be the universe's sole intelligence. (I recall he's not morphing anymore and would have lost his Jake/Marco/Tobias/David morphs when Alloran died, leaving him with fewer options to entertain himself.)

Edit: But I see your point about the literary side... maybe if Jake's inner monologue remarked, at the beginning, that V3's language sounded suspiciously casual? (If that's the sort of thought that Jake would have.)

** Oh, excellent!

I had a bit of an “I can see my house from here” moment when the Visser mentioned the thing about certain people being in contact with the manufacturers that made the repulsorlifts. It feels possible that I influenced that line with my comment on the /last/ chapter, wondering where the repulsorlifts came from. :D

Anyway, wow, who would have thought military negotiations could be so exciting? I suppose it helps that there's universe-level stakes and characters we love, and like, aliens.

Bit of a cold sweat when it came out that THEIR Iscafil device happens to be The Chosen Iscafil Device. Kinda makes you wonder if all the lame ones are called /Escafil/ Devices, eh?

Jake's poor little black box is right. There are soooo many layers here. Who even knows what's real? Who could possibly keep track of it all?

Also, Jesus, Magellan. Jake /knows/ you don't get in the car with the kidnapper, and he /knows/ you know that, and just - just let him, okay? He's probably better at this than you. He has the measure of the situation and the risk. This is THE way to dance with the top of the food chain, and didn't y'all fly into space looking to negotiate with the Visser anyway? Huff.

** Have I missed something, or do we have no idea how Leerans work? Because their abilities seem like the sort of thing you'd need to be a baby Ellimist to pull off.

I've also found it curious this entire time that Leerans are basically treated as machines, more than life. How similar/different are they to the Leerans from the books?

I do like how Leerans are taken a bit more seriously, here. I only remember them appearing in canon twice, in spite of there seemingly being a lot of background buildup toward their relevance. One showed up to save Vissor 1 at the end of 15, and 18 was all about a Z-space "accident" sending the Animorphs to Leera to resolve the dangling plot-thread. And I don't remember them ever being mentioned again, as though this was supposed to be the primary story arc for the teens and that was all.

18 is one of the few Animorphs books I own in Braille. It's also the one I haven't even opened, because in spite of being a major event that resolved a plotline we were being reminded of for a while... it felt out of place and fillerish. ... Huh, this probably applies to a certain important event in one of my original series, too, come to think of it. Hmm.

** Longtime reader and huge fan of your work. One of the best fics - period. KA Applegate should be begging to partner with you and make this a new canon.

Very interesting chapter. I admit, the Visser convinced me already. Why not move towards a slow disarmament?\\
I'm willing to believe he's even mostly telling the truth - wanting to survive, primarily, and really only wanting/needing the cube. Though I suspect he's much less willing to let non-Visser life persist than he lets on in that conversation. Still, that would be evident from a Leeran, so why bother lying. All he has to really lie about is about not knowing what would really happen if he is able to use the iscafil device - and he could hide that by making the trade in a body never exposed to his research findings.

Way I see it, there are two paths moving forward towards the obvious end-game of unlocking the Eye of the Universe (to use Outer Wilds terms) where the gods reside. Either the Animorphs make the trade - buying human independence and safety (assuming they can work through the no-doubt-eventful disarmament and negotiation), but trusting V3 with essentially the key to the universe. They protect themselves and their people, at the expense of potentially Everyone, while trusting an entity that will definitely double-cross them any chance he gets, because they see no other choice.

OR - they do the reverse. If the Visser is to be trusted in his goals (big if) of living forever and stopping entropy, then he is kinda-sadly-strangely someone who could be empathized with. They can't trust him, after what he's done, but perhaps they could ask him to trust them? He has their morphs, he can see into their minds, and he could (potentially) believe some human is capable of holding the key to the universe and fulfilling its promise to follow their common goal - e.g. by solving entropy. They ask the Visser to give an Animorph the instructions they need to unlock the eye of the universe.

Of course, the Visser would never make that trade without considerable consolations - he probably wouldn't make it /at all./ I imagine taking that path and having the Visser let them lead the mission would mean basically trading him every shred of leverage they have - complete and utter surrender of the entire planet, any z-space nukes, every other Animorph, and probably even put a Visser-yerk in reduced-capacity in the co-pilot seat as they open the door. Everything short of the fact that the Visser needs to trust (in the end) that the key holder will use that power as promised. Just the way he operates. (And might would probably be trying like mad to control even that shred of agency). Still, ultimately it's a path of trust between the Animorphs and the Visser, betting everything on the Cube.

I see those two paths as the Crayak and the Ellimist split - one is the result of fear, one is (very reluctant, but still ultimately total) trust and understanding of one-another. It's possible because - strange as it sounds - the Visser really /should/ be able to trust at least someone. The humans and their goals are pretty simple, and they are naturally inclined to empathy. But also - he won't necessarily see that, and only point out the desire for vengeance. Makes it a very interesting negotiation. IF the Visser actually cared about what he claims (big if) then they could conceivably work together - and he could conceivably trust the humans to lead the mission of unlocking the universe.

So many game pieces could be played with here though. Even if the Visser somehow saw the logic of this trust and worked together, what's to stop Marco (or Rachel?) from sabotaging it all out of vengeance - fueled by Crayak? Looking forward to quite the complex swirl of trust as we reach end-game.

This is all to say, of course, I probably need to re-read the previous Visser chapters and realize just how fundamentally untrustworthy he is. Though honestly I've been remembering him as just a Pure Heartless Rational entity, so I'm willing to believe he's capable of seeing the path to total cooperation here. Just a question of whether the Animorphs will see it and be willing to take it too.

*** My own inclination here would be to get the Visser to agree to tell Helium how to hack the god computer. Of course doing this in a way that prevents him from defecting and tricking Helium into installing a backdoor for the Visser to seize control would be tricky. Or even just having one of his clones attack at the last moment and stealing the key to victory.

Maybe if they had the same setup as their current negotiation but added a couple of Leerans at both ends it could work? Visser knows how to hack the computer a little bit and the Leeran copies his brain state to the Visser 1 fragment on his end. This information is shared between the fragments and the Leeran clone on Helium's end (at an undisclosed location to avoid ambush) copies the state into him. Then Helium works on the problem in manageable byte sized chunks and everyone in the system chews over the data to decide how to proceed. Except maybe the link between the Visser 1 fragments isn't high bandwidth enough to support the scheme. Maybe the two ends if the link can't be hidden from eachother. Maybe the Leeran on Heliums end is trapped.

The other option involves the Good Ship that Tobias found acting as a safe spot for a non hostile meeting. (I don't think any of the other animorphs know about that yet though?) It should have enough power to prevent violence/defection on the part of all parties. The setup then might be Visser locked in a room, Leeran locked in seperate room, and then Helium locked in a third room working on the hack. Except the ship is almost certainly more than powerful enough, but it might not be intelligent enough. The way it was described, knowing how to react to things by comparing the situation to other situations in its memory and selecting an appropriate response, it's like a super advanced neural net. It can probably stop Visser 3 from any form of trickery that it has seen before, which just leaves all the novel forms that the Visser's considerable intelligence can come up with for this super important event.

Trust is quite hard enough as it is, and V3's actions up until now are not exactly making it easier.

There's also the possibility that they successfully hack the God computer and then Elimist and Cryak both look at this branch if the They-Were-A-Simulation-This-Whole-Time and agree to not let it occur in reality and then end the simulation because it no longer has bearing on the game being played in the real world.

One last thought, going back to the Good Ship chapter I noticed I thing I hadn't before. "There was distress, then, or at least its shadow, for the ship also remembered what had happened next, last time---" I guess this is the time The One Who Is Remembered somehow subverted the anti violence program and made two Howler ships collide. I'm not sure how important this ends up being though.

** Nice try, V3. But if you really wanted to build a Dyson Sphere around every star, you know that you'd need German Engineering. And.... you killed all the Germans :(

Anyway, his presented "wants" seem rather doubtful. Especially his claim that by the time humans and Andalites build Dyson spheres it "would be too late". Unless "too late" really means a couple trillion years in life expectancy less. [The average star has a lifespan in the billions, Andalites and humans would get around to harvesting them much sooner!] But since he expects trillion trillions anyway, then his other stated values of adventure, companionship, creation, experience and sunshine, green grass and blue skies basically matter less than a trillionth of a percent. (considering that his rampaging puts large costs on all those things)

Anyway, Jake should pretend to go along with this ridicolousness and negotiate for V3 sharing future sun-harvesting tech once developed and he should probably ask for the Milky Way or at least a spiral arm under Leeran. V3 can have the rest of the lightcone. [though really, aren't black holes the energy source for the endgame, anyway?]

Also I hope Magellan's next move is to create a couple more Jakes so he can use that lying trick himself. Plus a bunch more Marco, Rachel, Tobias and Garret spares. Give them all the Quat-morph, acquire a Naharan and start working on some quantum virusses!
