** And [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com/2017/04/22/sunlight-ch-08-simon-martin/][here's the link to chapter 60]], which happens in the middle of 62, in case you need a refresher.

In retrospect, I'm not so sure that this was a great way to frame things.

Also, apologies for being so late on this one. Various things happened. I do not intend to drop the story unless there is ever a general consensus among the readers that it's fallen off the rails and cannot be saved (still might not drop it, even then, but that's the minimum requirement that I'm looking at right now).

That said, I might be reorganizing my writing schedule in a such a way to better account for some of the problems that I've come across.

The biggest issue is that, with 100+ characters to keep track off, my story has gone off the rails in ways that I didn't expect. I suppose that this is good, insofar as it means that I'm doing a fairly good job of letting these characters do what they're gonna do rather than restricting them to what I *want* them to do, but... I'm an outline-focused author, and my lovely characters have seen fit to chew up that outline and spit out a wet, raggedy mess.

(Exhibit A: My original outline expected that Viejo would be alive and that neither she nor Akvo would be in PALATINATE custody.)

Thanks for coming with me this far. We're almost to the end of 2014.
