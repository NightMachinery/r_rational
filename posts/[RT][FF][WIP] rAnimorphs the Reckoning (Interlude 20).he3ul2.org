*** Seems to me that the Yeerks are /definitely/ being messed with, but in an entirely mundane way. Rather than the Ellimist/Crayak actually reaching into the Yeerks' minds and controlling their thoughts here, they've simply artfully engineered events so that the "seduction of the immediate lifestyle" is both something that is at play for the Yeerks as a species and is drastically accelerated by the events of this war. I don't think this decision itself is suspect, but I do think the circumstances leading up to it (including the fundamentals of Yeerk psychology and the evolutionary history of their homeworld) are.

** Ok I had my think.

#+begin_quote
  The thrill of movement, of power---the feel of muscles, of legs that walked and hands that grasped and teeth that gnashed and tore---of eyes that looked where you pointed them.
#+end_quote

Is Visser One a shard of Hyruk?

I can't believe it's taken me this long but I finally appreciate the nod to The Sharing with...the sharing.

#+begin_quote
  And sour they turned, when Cirran---acting alone! Unthinkable heresy!---murdered Seerow and captured Alloran, launching the second---and greater---war.
#+end_quote

What is the fate of Cirran? Was it punished by the Council for its actions? It was at least around until the 'third wave'.

#+begin_quote
  There was an art to it, an art which Hyruk had mastered during the war years---to understand the nature of one's hosts, and impart one's shards with just the right properties to achieve a semblance of coordination and strategy, despite the unavoidable lag and the shards' inherent idiocy. Whole battles had been won or lost on the basis of a handful of hosts improperly aimed.

  Now, though, the waters were muddied, the barrier blurred. There were decisions being made outside of the pool---more and more of them, as the larger-brained hosts became an ever-greater share of the empire's population, and a correspondingly greater share of each coalescion's mental power lived beyond the immediacy of the sharing. More and more of them, as the fast-paced realities of space combat demanded ever-greater autonomy on the part of hosts that needed to be able to respond in the moment, without dependence on---or oversight from---the central mind.
#+end_quote

Hold up, this is sounding kinda familiar. The idea of the coalescion's mental power living beyond the immediacy of the sharing strongly reminds me of the superintelligence conversation that Perdao had with Aximili in Chapter 50. The shard-host intelligence/ability is outclassing that of the coalescion, and starting to consume the coalescion entirely:

#+begin_quote
  ‹Irrelevant. Don't focus on the details of the concept itself. Focus on the creatures that envisioned it---the human thinkers that dreamed up such a possibility. They were quite concerned about the prospect---at least, the ones hailing from California were. They feared that such an intelligence might expand without limit---that it would be unstoppable, outclassing human ingenuity as surely as human ingenuity outclasses that of cows, or insects. That its goals would almost inevitably be incompatible with the goals of humans, and that it would sweep them aside---or worse, consume them entirely.›
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  With each new cycle of infestation and reintegration, the share of its experience drawn from this new way of life grew larger, such that it could feel its own reluctance shrinking, its hesitation fading---and this despite knowing that that was why, despite knowing that here was a process which would produce exactly such a shift in values regardless of whether it was correct in truth.

  It was nightmarish, horrifying---like watching oneself slowly dissolving away in acid. Worse---like watching oneself dissolve while simultaneously witnessing the birth of an uncanny doppelganger.
#+end_quote

Interesting that Hyruk and Visser 3 (original) share a similar fear. Although in V3's case, I suppose the uncanny doppelgangers have already been born?

#+begin_quote
  It was a problem Hyruk had utterly failed to anticipate---a problem none of them had anticipated, or things would surely have gone differently between Cirran and Alloran.
#+end_quote

While this refers to the idea of becoming ever more reliant on sentient hosts, I feel this also refers to the value-shift horror that Hyruk is experiencing. It seems that Esplin was able to look ahead and anticipate it as he's so terrified of it. But, it seems he decided to keep that bit of knowledge separate from the coalescions and perhaps use it to his advantage. No wonder why they don't trust him, he literally doesn't share...

Finally, we see the contrasting CHN/OUS argument in Hyruk. Seems CHN is winning.

  There was more---much more---but Hyruk could look no further, /think/ no further---physically unstuck itself from the courier Yeerk so that the memories would cease to flow while it processed what it had seen.
#+end_quote

It looks that Hyruk was panicked into disconnecting /just in time/ to miss the Remote Sharing that would've solved all its objections (and, incidentally, showcased for us a real-time hive-mind, with access to all a coalescion's superintelligence). Now that the Control-Issues Coalescion is going into full infohazard isolation, it doesn't look like this negotiation is going to be resolved without bloodshed. Damn you, Ellimist and/or Crayak, and your 32D chess games!

Honestly, I kind of expected him to somehow realize immediately that the human agents weren't actually Controllers. For supposed superintelligences, Yeerk coalescions have disappointed me ever since they didn't try to tech up.

#+begin_quote
  and Nathan had half-died and been reborn as Jur Hona.
#+end_quote

I see we've found the 20th century isekai. Shame what happened to him.

--------------

It's great to see this unexpected but totally-a-possible-issue-in-hindsight problem rear up. It's still /slightly/ weird to me, because isn't this just a coalescion's normal modus operandi? Gain experiences from hosts, change based on experiences. The revelation in this chapter was that more views are being shaped externally and only shared afterwards, due to bigger host brains.

I still have an issue with Hyruk seeing such changes as unnatural dissolutions, regardless of where they were sourced, because minds don't really object to being changed--if they don't change, it's because the weight of the evidence and experiences don't stack up, but whatever, that's why I'm not changing my mind; whereas if they do change, it's because, duh, they do, and that's why I changed my mind. Maybe Hyruk noticed because of the relative suddenness of the change, or because of its different brain architecture.

It's reminiscent of the issue I had with Visser Three's standards,

#+begin_quote
  But there was also within me a deep and unrelenting horror of unbecoming---of waking up one day and not even /noticing/ that I had ceased to be myself.

  ...

  Change.

  It was small---subtle---but it was undeniably there. The protections I had put into place---the entire value stabilization framework---they had failed. It was Kandrona no longer---it had been moved by the shadow of Kilgam, shifted by the smallest fraction, a degree insignificant---

  -Chapter 29
#+end_quote

which was that they seemed to be impossible. A person's value system can be completely flipped just by watching Fox News for a few years. Is the Visser /actually/ immune to such a thing (I'm not even talking about his Super-Saiyan intergalactic form, but even merely in the base form he's supposedly trying to preserve), or is he just grasping at straws?

What Hyruk objects to, I think, is that its hands and fingers have suddenly acquired brains of their own, and are making their own choices as fully autonomous agents.

Previously, yes, Hyruk was influenced by its shards, but those shards basically never did anything they weren't supposed to do and they never thought of themselves as independent beings. Now, though, they /do/, so it's less like "Watching Fox News" and more like "Somebody injecting Fox News into your brain," because Hyruk never /planned/ for its shards to act the way that they're acting, or adopt the beliefs that they're adopting.

I remember going "another interlude???? what a ripoff" and then having my brain destroyed by this in a good way. it's great to have the perspective of a main coalescion for reasons everyone else have made abundantly clear

I'm really liking this, the whole moral dillemma that what the anis think is the right thing might actually be /wrong/ and more wrong than they can hope to comprehend

I feel this is pieces being laid down for the ending I humbly requested, where the anis work out what E/C are planning and double cross them and have the last laugh. Even if this isn't what ultimately happens, the fact that I'm anticipating it has me invested in the story, giving me the options of being surprised by the story (Yay!!! I WILL FEEL EMOTIONS) or my guesses being confirmed (which let's be fair is super validating because you get to feel like you're a galaxy brain genius and is why movies design for you to figure out the twist about thirty seconds before the MC does).

I feel like I know what's happening and I care about the characters, which is good because I was getting worried you were about to lose me in that respect.

​

The fact that I have to scroll down to see if you've written anything is a criminal oversight by this community.

​

One note, and this is more of a comment than a suggestion or a complaint: While I really really like the many scenes where Fateful Decisions are being made under pressure (highlights of the fic and emblematic of the fic as a whole), it might be an interesting change of pace for a decision point to be more 'obvious'.

Obviously, they could still stress about why it's so easy to come to conclusion even when normally this would seem to be a tricky problem --- are we missing something? Is this a trap from Cr or El? Are we being thrown a bone again? Either way, the decision scenes are great, I just wouldn't want.. it to feel repetitive with too much of a good thing. (Unless you're trying to write the rationalist decision equivalent of Worm, in which case shine on you crazy diamond.)

​

And, not that I think I should get an input, but put me solidly in the "Visser 3 must be defeated/destroyed for a good ending to be possible" camp. If C&E's big computer can be smashed and their influence on the universe be eliminated, that would also be beneficial to the good ending cause. What they're up to is decidedly Not Cool, Bro.

** Wow, I loved this. The Yeerk homeworld is such an interesting setting. Hyruk leaving a child colony in its old pool was legitimately touching. It makes me reconsider the point when there were shards distressed that the Visser had destroyed a pool, sort of makes those relationships feel real and good and sad to lose (not to forgive the Yeerks for enslaving people of course).

Hyruk's origin story felt like a legitimate epic, I would totally read a Yerk Chronicles sort of book now haha. I'm very impressed this story has brought me from just hating the Yeerks when I read the originals, to hoping for a good outcome for them.

Getting more of a perspective from the coalescion side on the shard vs sharing issue was great, makes me want to go back and read the previous shard points of view again, particularly the Yeerk AMA, to view it in that light.

Thanks for another great chapter!

**** I'm not sure. Here's some reasons i retroactively came up with

-The chapter works really well /both/ as a standalone story (assuming the reader had read canon animorphs) /and/ has multiple satisfying ties to the rest of your story. I often forget crucial parts of the plot thread and therefore fail to appreciate important parts of the story, but that's not a problem at all here. At the same time the chapter organically connects to and sheds light on various aspects of the plot. For instance, you can really better understand how V3 feels as a result of this chapter - it's clear that the intro of sentient hosts has created an identity crisis for many yeerks, v3 is just the most extreme case of this because he has the smartest host. And you can understand the sense of "weird abberation of modernity" regarding v3's behavior from a yeerk perspective.

-Compelling world building regarding the culture, society of the yeerks /and/ a focus on narrative and individual characters in the story. Usually in fantasy fiction, worldbuilding chapters sacrifice on actual story and vice versa, but you've done them both simultaneously here. I especially loved the pairing of the journey in the desert with bringing new identity to a yeerk coalescence, it brought to my mind the hebrews crossing the desert paired with getting the stone tablets and birth of new culture.

-True alien perspective. E.g. I really enjoyed that Hyruk is uncomfortable because something has changed, but it's /not/ because of moral qualms about infesting sentient beings, it's because of the proportional role of the host. A lesser writer would have written a pang of moral conscience squashed down, or a depiction of cackling evil, but you wrote in a concern which fits within a consistent alien value system and culture. Yet, it's quite relatable, you can definitely feel the "oh no modern society isn't as good as it was back in my day" feeling, where the culture seems to be shifting out of control. It's extra cool because the nature of the species allows the Hyruk to talk about /themselves/ shifting out of control in the first person, whereas the human equivalent would be "kids these days".

-While it's not entirely clear what exactly the primitive yeerks are fighting over (I think that would be cool to know), I really like that they absorb the perspectives of their enemies, see the war from both sides, take on the emotional perspective of the traumatized enemy. I also like that the effect of this is actually to make them harder and less trusting, rather than softer and more empathetic - I'm not sure why I that concept, but it feels true to something.
