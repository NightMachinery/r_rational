** I swear to god, I haven't been continually blue ballsed this hard since I picked up Worm. Goddammit, EE.

Unless I'm missing something, Cat still has her 'invisible crossbow,' whatever that means. More likely than not, that's referring to Archer - though I wouldn't put it past Catherine to have a literal invisible crossbow slung across her back. We've also got Hakram and Viv (with a blade of stolen starlight) out there, doing who knows what. With the decoherence of the Threefold Reflection, I assume Hakram's job of finding his way to Malicia got all the more easier. Expect a last minute intervention by one or all three of them, when Cat inexplicably finds her back against the wall.

If Malicia were intelligent - and I have no reason to believe that she isn't - she'd have sent a meat puppet to Keter, which throws into question what Cat's gonna do then. Succession doesn't mean much if the person you're deposing is still alive, at the end of the day.

Speaking of, Akua seeks to become Catherine's Chancellor. In other news, water is wet and people die if they are killed. Judging from Cat's reaction to this 'revelation,' she doesn't have any way to deal with that Story if it were to become set in stone. I'm assuming that would have been (one of) Akua's endgame(s) here? Set herself up to be the dependable and loyal sixth ranger? Play to the narrative and become a sidekick? The Black to Cat's Malicia? I'm not exactly sure what'd stop Catherine from just shredding her soul if it ever got to that point, but I dearly hope she doesn't take that route. Diabolist is far too entertaining. Like a better, more plot-relevant Larat. (What would win? A spit-signed oath, or the power of the Story? One would argue they're one and the same, actually.)

I wonder what kind of powers Malicia could bring to bear against Catherine, if she was dumb enough to actually be present in Keter. She doesn't play a particularly combat oriented Role, but Names are Names, and treating them as anything less is a surefire way to get yourself killed. She has Speak as an explicit Aspect, no? "Catherine, dear, do me a favor and kill yourself?"

Point: Cat and Akua both are made of Winter ice, shadows, and mist that have as much in common with mundane wetness as parakeets, and both of them have avoided the whole "actually dying" thing despite having both been handily killed thing before.

I think it's a question of etiquette more than intelligence. Malicia desperately needs the Dead King involved in the crusade and might not be willing to risk giving offense by not appearing in person. Especially since she's already put plans in motion that require the Dead King's intervention. If he were to refuse her she'd be absolutely boned.

That still works out for Cat, somewhat. It's the lesser victory because she still has Malicia breathing down her neck (Malicia probably won't outright retaliate though because she also has her back pressed to the wall by crusade, so she needs Callow as a buffer), but it still removes Malicia from negotiations, making Cat's terms the only ones available for Dead King to take up on. And that was the main goal of this assassination plot to begin with.

**** Oh right, I completely forgot that Malicia was just a means to an end - very good point there. Plus all this chicanery makes for a good spot of practice when it comes time for the real thing.

Though, imagining Cat strolling into the Dead King's palace, boisterous, loud and smiling wide, still covered in blood from last night's successful murder is hilarious to me.

"Neshie! Old buddy, old pal! Heard what happened to Malicia last night. Terrible, that. A real, /real/ tragedy. I can't believe the entire Threefold Reflection went up in flames; like, all three of them, all at once! Oh well, what can you do - life, sometimes, you know? Anyways, what do you say we get a head start on all this boring diplomatic nonsense? I've got some new terms I'm sure you'll find /very/ agreeable, this time around."

** This is probably just wishful thinking on my part, but I can't help but see this whole arc as the beginning of Catherine's redemption/transition to at least anti-hero rather than outright villain.

Sure, she's in Keter ostensibly to ally with one of the Bigger Bads, but she's now found out that he primarily just summoned her to there to recognize her as one of the true players in the game. Now she's marching into the stronghold of the Dread Empress, with the last of her allies having been left behind to convalesce from the exertion of carrying her to this threshold.

Seems like a pretty classically heroic story line, especially considering she spent some time immediately before embarking on this speaking with the ghost of a long-dead and righteous King, and has it looming over her head that she's transitioned out of the Name of Squire but not yet taken up a new, defined Name/Role. She's a nexus of power via the mantle of Winter, but that's clearly a power source very much in transition itself.

If I'm being cynical, EE will have Catherine crash through the Empress' guards, get properly fucked up in the doing of it, possibly evolving her powers in a minor way in doing so, then it'll just a flesh-clone of Malicia at the end. Malicia won't take it personally and Callow will remain in a heightened state of cold war with the Empire, leaving Catherine just enough breathing room to focus on Procer while knowing the Empire is probably going to be working to actively destabilize Callow as opposed to simply stymieing its attempts to grow more stable. All this while now having to deal with the Dead King being a more active player and the fallout of whatever Black does in Procer.

If I'm being optimistic, confronting Malicia will cause Catherine to crystallize her understanding of the difference in approaches between her and Malicia/Black. Ultimately, those two are just trying to play the game as well as possible by taking into account the meta-level knowledge that they are in a game with a semi-reactive Creation trying to guide things along certain paths. (Sort of like adding another player with a somewhat intelligible utility function, but not really attempting to modify the payoff matrix in any significant way).

Catherine is laser focused on the maximization of her own goals and is willing to play on the meta-meta-level that if the rules and players of the game don't permit such an outcome then those rules and players can be changed, /including/ the enforcers of the narrative. This isn't really conscious on her part yet, but I'm hoping continued conflict with Malicia will bring it into focus. I doubt that this will result in her taking another discrete Name or Role - that would be simply playing along with the game. The closest analogue I can think of is Ryoka in The Wandering Inn refusing to take Classes/Levels since doing so makes her dependent on the game system of that world.

*** It's kind of counter-intuitive but I think that the redemption story will be what forces Cat to become the Dread Empress.

Thinking about it, there's only really two Roles that kill a Dread Empress - claimants or heroes. If she does kill Malicia by stepping into a heroic Role she will be playing into the Grey Pilgrim's redemption trap that culminates in her death. The only other Role available to her would be to kill the Dread Empress as a claimant.

To be honest, I'm hoping she'll dodge both of these but she's not really considered how this debacle reflects on the narrative as a whole, so it's hard to say if she has a deeper plan or not.

**** That sounds about right to me, depending on what you mean by exposure.

He seems in a way more content than almost anyone else in the story. It's probably more that he's just learned that big, bold, dramatic actions typically have the kind of unpredictable consequences that Cat has been struggling with in her rise to power. As a result, he prefers to win by slowly and inexorably building his power base, taking as few risks as possible.

I don't think he's trying to minimize his exposure in Creation, just that he only bothers to involve himself when he sees the opportunity to take advantage. He's got no skin in the game of the rise and fall of empires and isn't bothered by Calernia being ruled by either Good or Evil for a few centuries.

So, if by exposure you meant that he's just trying to make sure nothing in Creation spills over into his realm too much without a massive potential upside, then yeah that sounds about right. If you meant that he wants to simply have as little to do with Creation as possible regardless of his expectation of the outcome, then no, I don't think that's right. He was the one that reached out to Cat in the first place, IIRC.

This might have been a mistake from Diabolist, right? If Catherine figures out how to reliably reproduce this effect, she can give Diabolist a dose of supervillain madness at will to keep her predictable, while enjoying greater Winter powers.

*** I think "Catherine's Plan" was hinted at by the quote at the beginning of the chapter. Akua's Plan was 17 different plots at once. Catherine's Plan is the Indy Ploy: No plan whatsoever.

That's a good question about the Skein. I had thought that it smashed the wheels in a "taking you with me, collapse-the-pocket-dimension" attempt. And appeared to have succeeded. When it collapsed, though, it left Cat, Akua, and Masego all in the same void. Akua and Cat can be explained away via Winter mantles and chains, but not Masego. So if all parties present were not shunted into their own personal voids, shouldn't the Skein have been right there with them? Or maybe it was, but lacking wings or any other propulsion, it just floated with no way to pursue? The text should have at least made a passing mention of it, though.

EDIT:

It occurs to me that, as the keeper of the Threefold Reflection, the Skein may have been the unique actor, and so he was affected by the collapse differently than the visitors.

Then she sent her first two (not her last two, the first allies she relies on: the enemy who gives her more power, and her trusty thinky wizard) , because the wizard was tired and needed a bodyguard, and Cat still needs to go murder, someone who has previously made mutually beneficial deals fey nobility, well mutually beneficial, aside from empowering Cat.
