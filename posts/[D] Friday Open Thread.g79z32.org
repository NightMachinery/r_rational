Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

** After years of extremely slow progress on the book series I most want to write, I decided to try something different and just write a short Isekai. 16k words in a week.

I kinda hate that it's been so much easier.

It won't classify as rationalist, but it's got a typical genre savvy asshole MC who figures out how to break the system, this time with Wisdom, healing and the ability to magically see through lies. Instead of some kid nobly sacrificing themselves to save somebody else's life, I had the MC be a schoolyard bully who got Isekai'd when he accidentally put himself in danger by pushing another kid to be mean.

I'll put it up somewhere when progress stalls or the story is done. Mostly just wanted to say 'Yay I did something' and 'I hate that this is so much easier'.

****** Well, I read it, but I don't know enough about the setting to provide much useful feedback. It sounds like the tech levels are high, but if so communications and the ability to get up to date information on things like stock ownership should be much better. There should never be a need to consult records that are days old. If markets are still running, all data should be available at the push of a few buttons.

There is clearly some sort of major catastrophe going on, but I don't know enough about it or the world to say how people should react. I do find the lack of communication strange. Nobody ever leaves a factory to produce unwanted goods for weeks, because that costs /money/, which the economy values over anything and everything else. Similarly, short of the apocalypse, stock prices don't bounce up and down 20% outside of the very peak and bottom of market cycles, with very short lived exceptions for disasters like a major pandemic. Look at the Corona crash - -30% across the board in less than two weeks, followed by moves of only a percent or three a day. I guess there might be a more serious pandemic going on in the story, since all those deaths flew under the radar, but the window during which prices move quickly should be pretty short, or you'll need new disasters for every subsequent window of price chaos.

Anyway. I don't mean to sound critical. My observations are skewed by the fact that I am not familiar with the setting. Some or all of what I said may be dead wrong because there are important factors that don't exist in reality but which would definitely shape things in this world.

** Is the concept of infohazards itself an infohazard?

I ask because I've seen a fairly consistent pattern play out on this subreddit a few times that goes something like this:

1. Person 1 mentions infohazards
2. Person 2 chimes in saying they know of one in real life but don't want to share it because, by it's very nature, it causes harm by being spread
3. There's a parade of comments asking to be DM'd the infohazard's details, presumably because not knowing is judged to be worse than whatever the infohazard itself is.
4. This requires sharing the infohazard which presumably makes people worse off than if they had never heard of it in this first place.

Just something I've been wondering about lately. I recognize that, if this is the case, I am guilty of bringing up the topic again, so sorry for any harm this mention of infohazards causes.

******** Cheers. So the one in my world isn't a creature-like thing like in the SCP, but it's got the same basic setup where they make it so you are most likely to discover it in a special room cut off from everything else. Though in my case the person in the room gets to communicate with the rest of the team outside to dictate what information must be destroyed to stop anyone discovering it again too easily, and then everyone has a nice long brain scrub to forget all about it until it's time to repeat.

In my world the bad thought is realizing what destiny wants. It's not a living thing and it's not sentient, but once someone realizes what its ultimate goal is, it uses that person's brain capacity to work toward that goal. And it's not a nice goal. Someone knowing what it wants is not an instant loss condition, but it basically shifts the entire universe into Hard Mode until the knowledge is wiped out.

*** If we had SCP-level infohazards in real life, then yes, discussing them would absolutely be an infohazard. However, usually bringing up real-life infohazards in these sorts of discussions also tends to bring up information which serves to inoculate against those infohazards, and overall, in the context of a highly networked culture where memetic spread occurs rapidly, the benefits of inoculation likely outweigh the risks of exposure.

As an example, [[https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202044.pdf][Bursztyn et al. (2020)]] investigated the effects of Sean Hannity's downplaying of coronavirus and discovered that Fox News viewers who tended to watch Hannity more than Tucker Carlson were more likely to get coronavirus and died as a result. That's a decent of example how real-life infohazards tend to work. Antivaxxer propaganda is another good example of a memetic hazard with a significant death toll. Becoming more aware of bullshitters and ignoring them is a good way to keep yourself safe.

*** I kinda want to say no, because for the most part most infohazards aren't that dangerous.

I'm going to start by stating my personal definition of infohazard. A thought or idea that results in a major, fundamental shift in your worldview which may or may not be traumatic. Some people might say that I'm just defining 'hard truths', but they are very similar things to me.

The issue is that every person is a lock with a specific key-infohazard that actually harms them. As one can guess, due to how most keys don't fit most locks is another way of saying that most infohazards aren't dangerous to most people.

The most obvious example is Roko's Basilisk. Most people correctly treated it as another Pascal's Mugging or just as a silly hypothetical, but there were a few who were adversely affected by it. Therefore while most discussions about infohazards don't actually have any, a few do. And while most infohazards aren't dangerous to you in particular, a few do.

And you can't actually know for sure until it happens.

Fortunately, infohazards are like a mental virus which means it's possible to protect against them or to inoculate yourself against them.

- You can simply avoid all topics about infohazards as a general precaution.
- You can be more selective and only avoid infohazards about topics that you feel deeply passionate about. For example, if you care a lot about AI, avoid Roko's Basilisk. If you have trouble dealing with death, avoid philosophical considerations about whether or not there is an afterlife. If you care a lot about winning and deeply, /deeply/ hate losing anything, you should avoid losing The Game. That part is a little tricky, because it requires you to know your hot-button topics.
- You can learn to study other people's viewpoints of the world, especially people who you strong disagree with. So if you get overwhelmed, you can fall back on re-framing your worldview in a way that helps with the existential dread. By knowing how other people think, your mindset becomes more flexible and robust.

Personally, I think dealing with a few infohazards/hard truths are a good thing for people when it comes to maturing and expanding one's mind, but it's something that should be done only if the individual is in a healthy place mentally speaking and ready for it.

TL;DR - Nope.

It feels like there's been a spate of conceptually simple puzzle games that have relatively good production values, which I appreciate. /Puddle Knights/ was another one. You could have done the same game in an incredibly low-fi way, but it would have lost something, at least for me.

One of the other things that I've been enjoying about some recent puzzle games is the way that they'll break their framing device, but saying which ones do that would be a spoiler I'd think you'd be better off discovering on your own.

Where do virtues come from? Usually they are qualities of a person that lead to positive outcomes for themselves and society. Cultivating these virtues is a round-about way of increasing utility. You focus on the action first (likely to lead to a result) rather than the result first (likely to result from an action). There are edge cases where they do not align but they can be very similar in outcome, if not approach.

They also covers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle before that if you want to do them first.

** I notice that my post for the preorder of the audible /How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps/ by Andrew Rowe is getting down voted.

I don't really get why. Are people here upset by seeing audibles instead of an ebook or something?

** I think I just had a "Hahahaha he did the 'stop-pattern matching I'm not a strawman I'm not an inhuman monster STOP FILLING OUT YOUR DAMN BINGO CARD' thing again! He's so hilarious, just like all those other 'stop-pattern matching I am not a strawman' people whom we know only say that because they are inhuman monsters!" moment.

You know what, fuck these people, I respect myself too much to keep talking to them.
