** It honestly doesn't look like the author has any intention of explaining how 6 people managed to start a village that kept existing for thousands of years....that's really annoying. Even just one or two panels showing that other people who were unpetrified joined the village later would have been sufficient.

also that bit about senku and his dad not being biologically related is BS; there was no mention of that whatsoever in the flashback ad they look similar, as other users have pointed out. They only put that in there so fans could ship Senku/Ruri or Senku/Kohaku together without incest accusations. Really disappointing..

*** Agreed. And rather than a whole group of very well educated astronauts trying to advance science, record knowledge, and repopulate, they decide to casually subsist for an unknown number of years on an unsubstantiated belief that someone will wake up, rebuild society, and need supporters? It's nonsensical

**** Worse. If their one hope is Senku, why don't they have regular scouting groups out trying to find him such that they can protect him, rather than gambling that 1) he'll survive the stoning process 2) he'll survive immediately after getting out instead of say. getting killed by lions 3) can find the village by himself.

*** They still have acess to the internet at that point, meaning all the knowledge in the world, all electronic equipment intact, but thousands years later, they're basicly still savages. Also, I don't think 6 people will have enough genes diversity to survive that long. If the author won't elaborate on this, this gonna be the greatest ass-pull ever.

**** If I was in that situation I would break into cryobanks and get sperm/whatnot.
