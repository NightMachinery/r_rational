The agony suddenly stops, replaced by an ambient white light all around me. Ah, there he was. The fucker wore a dark grey hoodie that said “T.P.K.”

“I'm truly sorry,” he chuckled. “It was raining crit fails! Hadn't I seen the rolls myself, I wouldn't have believed it! Statistically impossible! I even started using a different die halfway in ...”

“A good DM would have fudged it,” I said angrily.

“Go to hells,” he replied smiling.

Right, that. Fun times ahead.

“I guess I'm going to the worst one?” I asked.

“Kind of,” he answered. “When they'll realize that Null Pointer Exception is forever out of their reach, they'll create a special new one for you.”

“Then ...”

“No,” he interrupted. “You won't find Arthur in the hells. That would be winning, and you lost. So, actually, you won't see him ever again. Game over. Except for the hells bit.”

“You know,” he continued, my brain still processing what he had just said. “That part was literally opt-in. And had you changed your mind, you could have secured TPK-safe ways to get your soul out. There are entads for that! Plus you could have prioritized destroying the hells, and ...”

“So you only brought me here to /gloat/?!”, I interrupted, strangely surprising him.

“Fair enough,” he answered. “I hesitated doing it, but then there was the rule of three ... I know, I know, it's technically four times, but it was exposed in three chapters, which is what matters.”

“Was I fully aware of the stakes, back then?” I asked apprehensively.

--------------

“I'll do it,” I said. “Can I ... what happens to me, when I leave Earth? I'd like to leave a note or something.” /If I was really here, was Earth even real?/ “I don't want to hurt anyone.”

“You could go back to the exact same moment,” he replied.

“Oh,” I replied. “Okay, I guess that works. Unless I don't want to, or die?”

“Then you don't go back, or you die,” he replied.

*** Everything below the break is cut and paste from an earlier chapter, in which the DM pulls Juniper out of his English class and interviews him to get consent for throwing him into Aerb. The DM erases the memory of the consent-granting interview so that Joon can figure out Aerb on his own, but then replays the memory for him during the second Joon-DM interview

**** I'm convinced the DM did not actually pull Juniper from the class, I think instead, the cutoff happened later (possibly MUCH later) and Joon's memory was simply rolled back to that innocuous instant because of how significant, spoilerific and possibly traumatic the rest of what truly happened after that class was. Or because it exposes important truths about the nature of Aerb and Earth. IMO some of that left-out bit was even part of the prior staging done with the DM.

****** Neither, I think it's one of two other possibilities: a case of existence, including ours, was a simulation all along with each universe serving as a breeding ground of sorts for generating narratives for more existences ; or a case of singularity happening later in Joon's life and enabling him to confront his lifelong regrets about Arthur, Tiff, etc. in a setting of his choice (a sensible, revised with hindsight, version of Aerb).

** I'd hardly consider being fully aware of the stakes him going to a super special inescapable hell that didn't even exist before, especially when there had never been any indication that new hells could even come into existence.

Even the game being over is stretching it, because the tooltip on the Helldiver mode specifically said it superseded the “Character Death Is Permanent” rule, which implies there is in fact some way to escape the hells and revive, at least for him.

*** I concede that I may have pushed it a bit far with the special hell, but this is special circumstances too: demons dying is a big deal, and a lot of demons have been dying. Perhaps I should have said "the worst one, with special attention."

On your death, would you rather cease to be or go to hell? If you chose the latter, check the box. I don't see how this promises for more. Had he had allies out to help him, he may have had some hopes. But this was Total Party Kill.

No, that was not my intention. The last four lines (after the break) are supposed to be stuff that Joon just remembers: the DM provides him the uncensored version of what he got in Chapter 79.

The intended meaning is that Joon is going to an hell that is worst than every previously-existing others, that there is no way out, and that he knowingly consented to all of this (even on an opt-in basis).
