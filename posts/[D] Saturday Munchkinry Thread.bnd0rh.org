Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** There's a special location where you can't knowingly speak an untruth or you die on the spot. You can, however, say something you believe is true and be wrong, or state your intentions and then change your mind, but at the moment you speak, it must not be a deliberate untruth.

Obviously that's quite useful for trials and business deals and alliances and all that jazz. /However/, it's also possible in this world to delete memories perfectly and irreversibly, as well as to temporarily suppress them or change them, or fabricate them entirely. Other than the permanent deletion, these gradually return to normal in about two years (Because souls heal brain damage because magic).

How much does the presence of memory magic take away from the power of this special location? Anyone rich and powerful has relatively easy access to the memory magic, although it is, of course, illegal, and could come back to bite you in the ass if you were locked up for the two years and then taken to the location.

***** If you are planning on writing about this magic, an interesting novice mistake to make is to delete the memories of an incident in question, but not to delete the memories of deleting the memories of the incident.

This one of the ideas which should be obvious if such mind magic is real, but makes the author look really smart for thinking of.

I think I read about a villain in a /Harry Potter/ fanfic who was caught because while he couldn't be Veritaserumed about something he Obliviated from his mind, he was caught anyway when he was asked if he remembered Obliviating himself of something at the same time as the crime. I don't remember where I read this though.

*** How this magic works and interacts with the truth-location is very strongly affected by what type of memories you allow to be affected.

Can the magic affect:

- Implicit Memory - Anything you remember unconsciously by rote or don't remember knowing. For example, if you went back to your old high school, if you can find your old math classroom even though you don't recall anything about the location, this is implicit memory.
- Procedural Memory - How to perform a task such as riding a bike, make a sandwich, or singing a song. This is considered to be a type of implicit memory.
- Explicit Memory - Information you have to work to recall such as phone numbers or addresses. The following three types all fall under explicit memory.
- Declarative Memory - Anything factual such as dates, words, faces, events, and concepts. They can be rules of a sport, capitals of the states, or someone's appearance.
- Semantic Memory - A subset of declarative memory concerning general facts such as rules of baseballs or someone's birthday.
- Episodic Memory - A subset of declarative memory concerning events such as a baseball game or birthday party.

These are all types of long term memory. Can the magic also affect short term memories (they last about one minute), working memory (information about what one is currently focusing on), or sensory memories (what you receive from your senses lasting fractions of a second)?

**** You can affect all of these, although messing with the subject's working and sensory memory is a bit overkill, and whatever you are trying to accomplish is probably easier done through other magic. Hard to make them remember the house as an elephant when they can actively see the house.

Implicit memory is probably the hardest to make sure you delete/alter fully, and if there is reason to think someone has been messed with, here might be where it's easiest to detect that different memories don't line up. Episodic memories are the fastest to wipe - for everything else you have to spend a little time getting into the mindspace of the target. Which you can, since anyone who can alter memories can also read them, but it will take more time.

Thank you for your input!

*** Intention can still be credibly stated in this location regardless of memory, so you still have the very valuable service of things like

- only electing politicians who can truthfully attest every month that they intend to act in service of what they believe to be the best possible world for the good of the populace
- Everyone sufficiently rich and powerful has to attest that they see no plausible futures in which they would use the memory magic short of directly protecting specific people from harm, and that in any such case they would report their usage to a given trusted authority.
- Honestly given promises

Of course all of the above can still be tainted by being based on incorrect past memories, but in the short term it's still accurate.

Other things that come to mind:

- Every single citizen of a country/employee of a corporation/etc is forced to visit this place and say a series of statements like "I harbor no intentions to commit murder", "I will never disobey the will of the Grand Emperor", etc., and everyone for whom that isn't true conveniently dies.

What are the logistics of the memory magic? How much is required for someone to use it? Some progressively more restrictive conditions:

- You can apply it to "everyone meeting condition X" without knowing who exactly that applies to
- You need only know their name
- You need visual contact
- You need physical contact
- You need prolonged access to their body for a period of several hours

Also, how much can memories be read? Like, can Powerful Person Paul delete my memories of the password to the vault even if Paul doesn't know what the password he needs to delete is? Can he delete every conversation I've had with Eve even if he doesn't know when or where I met her? Can he delete my memories of "entering a 1 on the keypad initially", see if that worked, then try deleting my memories of "entering a 2 on the keypad initially", etc., until he's extracted the password?

You need physical contact. A few seconds will do if you're good at it and know exactly what you are looking for, but magic can be felt by other magic users nearby while it is being used. It can't be felt after the fact, but during the actual memory tinkering, anyone nearby is likely to sense exactly what you are doing.

Anyone who can delete or alter memories can read them as well. They can't automatically or easily detect /other/ memory altering magic, but if they can change memories, they can also read them. The more extensively you want to alter things, and the more precise and exhaustive you want to be about it, the longer it takes. Want to delete all memories of a childhood friend, now we're likely looking at hours of work if you don't want to leave conflicting memories and little moments where you mentioned them briefly while talking to someone else.

You can delete memories as specific as passwords, but it wouldn't be by trial and error, you would just seek the memory out, watch it, confirm it's the right one, and then wipe it.

***** The obvious strategy here then seems to be nighttime reads - break into someone's house while they're sleeping, read all their memories, wipe any recollection of that night, and all they'll notice the next morning (or ever) is not sleeping well. Since the default state of sleep memories is nonexistent, there's nothing to alter once you scrub their memories, so they won't know what happened two years later.

*** Since memories return to normal in about two years, can't you just hold the suspect in jail for two years then test them? As for permanent deletion, that's easy enough to detect. Ask the suspect what they were doing at every moment in time that's relevant to the case. If their memories of that moment have been deleted, they wouldn't be able to say what they were doing.

But before all those issues though, I would outlaw any use of that special location. It is way way too dangerous. If you speak your intent and change your mind partway through the sentence, you die. If you misspeak and end up saying something you know is untrue, you die. If a lawyer confuses you into saying something you don't believe with double double negations, you die. It is just far too easy to die in the special location even when you have no intention of speaking untruths.

*** This is pretty dependent on more details of how memory magic is actually used. If it's the equivalent of "anyone can learn it's just really hard" then spreading memory magic is as easy as putting memories of how to do memory magic into someone's head. Bam, you've got a temporary memory mage who can make whatever they want true then delete their memory of being a memory mage.

It'd probably see the most use as shuffling prisoners through it if they claim they'd been memory-magic'd into confessing to a crime, as a form of two year high risk parole.

This is an excellent suggestion. Thank you.

Inserting memories is quite different from inserting skills, however. You can show someone video footage of how to perform surgery, but without all the surrounding medical knowledge a surgeon needs, they would still make a pretty poor surgeon. Most people /can/ learn to use it, in the same way that most people /can/ learn calculus, it's just not going to happen. It's also slightly constrained by how personality impacts magic in my world, but we are still talking more than 50% of the population being able to learn it if they try really, really hard for a long time, and learn all the lesser magic leading up to it. It's not incantations and hand movements, more like magical surgery.

*** Memory-altering makes it trickier to enforce the law in certain scenarios, but by no means impossible. Assuming it isn't so prohibitively expensive to change or delete memories that the state cannot afford to use it occasionally, all the memories of the suspect related to the investigation of the crime and the magical area itself could be deleted, thus preventing subsequent memory altering on the part of the suspect to cover his tracks 2 years down the line. Then, a subsequent trial could be staged in the special location 2 years after the crime, with the suspect now unaware of the magical phenomenon present, and a question posed as to some significant event in the original crime scene which law enforcement thought the memory of which might have been screwed with. If the suspect failed when attempting to lie and give his false alibi or what have you, he would be exposed as guilty. You could make this as complicated as you like, of course, from convincing the suspect he was answering to God himself to convincing him he was talking to a trusted friend.

Of course, I imagine this would cost quite a bit, so it would probably only be used on the rich or those who in some manner had the resources to alter their memories. Perhaps for the poor or middle class, it would be done on a lottery to help prevent the odd conspiracy or organized crime operation. And penalties for memory alteration would have to be excessive to work as an incentive against it.

There's always the odd chance that people might try to keep this process from working on them by spending large amounts of time, and thus generating many memories, thinking about the existence of the crime investigation and/or the special location. This could be prevented with some use of "meta-memories," however. It seems trivial enough to implant a memory in someone wherein they visit their psychiatrist who describes to them that they have an obsession with thinking about a fantasy of such nature.

**** You can mess with your own memories, but it's harder, and so fewer people can do it. However, the way personality shapes magic in my world, the more secretive and scheming you are, the more likely you happen to have a talent for it.

Others do not require your permission to mess with your memories, but they need to touch you, or at least be close, and you can't hide the fact that you are using magic from other magic users nearby. If you are both magic users, basically you need to be willing, asleep or otherwise helpless.

Fabricated memories are created by you imagining yourself in the position of the target and simulating experiencing the memory, then shoving that experience into their brain, possibly in place of the original memory if there was one. So it's easier if you know them, and unless you know them /very/ well it's going to take a while if you want it to seem realistic. If you are altering an existing memory, you would usually relive the real one by reading their mind, then playing it back with changes. If you want it seem as realistic as possible, you probably have to play it back and forth several times. If you want to change all memories on a topic, you have to do them all individually. Deleting is faster and easier, but fabricating and changing takes time. If you want it to be believable. If you wanted to you could just randomly fill all their memories with menacing pink elephants standing around in the background. That would be fast, just not very believable.

****** ...Huh. You know, it didn't even occur to me, but now that you raise the question. Your ability implant a memory definitely rests on you being able to fake it and make it seem real. A non-artist very likely would /not/ be able to make a master artist think they painted a particular masterpiece, because they couldn't go through the process in their mind. It might work briefly, but as soon as the artist started thinking about those memories, he would realize something was wrong and become deeply confused about this mismatch between what he remembers doing and how well he knows his thought processes and his art.

A blind magician could make use of other people's memories to get an accurate picture of vision is like, but it would still slow them down since they would have to make more of an effort to emulate a state of mind where seeing is normal.

...This is... interesting. I will need to go through a lot of my characters and their schemes and make sure none of them are doing anything they aren't able to. I can't think of any violations right now, but there is one case where half the victim's life is just complete fabrication, so I'll have to make sure the villain is able to fake all of it.

******* There are other ways of doing it based on how the process works. For example, I read something where there was mind control in the form of implanted memories. The way they got around this was talking to people, and the implanted memories didn't come with emotional processing - when they remembered the fake horrible things, they were outraged, but the memories did not include outrage. (They were artificially generated.)

In Inception, someone has to create the dreamscape - it can be the target, it can not be the target. The aspect I brought up never came up in Inception. If your story's process of creating the memories involves both participants (shaper + target), then this can be avoided, provided fake memories are not only produced solo. Alternatively it could take the form "what do you remember?" "I was at the bank when a short guy ran in with a gun and..." "It was a short guy not a tall guy. He was wearing a skii mask..."

I asked because if it was easy to do, then I'd want to do it for memorization and/or dream influencing purposes/attempts. 'I know what the lesson today was on, but I might not remember tomorrow, so I'm going to look in this mirror, practice saying out loud what I want to remember, and them I'm going to implant the memory, of those words voiced by Morgan Freeman.' 'I really liked that dream, but I'm going to forget it, so...' 'I want to have a dream with a swordfight/anime fight.'

If magic allowed the blind to have a memory of seeing things people would be /pretty/ interested. (In Inception, there were people who went to a place to experience dreams. The intended analogy seemed to be drugs.)

Maybe half the population has the raw potential for it, but not everyone gets to learn magic in the first place, and even if you /can/ learn mind magic, how easy it is, and how good you will be at it depends on your personality. About 5% of magicians end up learning enough mind magic to affect memories, and because of how magic works in my world, most of them are the type of person who become happy at the thought of being able to mess with other people's minds. That's not /strictly/ necessary, but it helps. A lot. Of course, if you wanted to learn it and use it to be the best psychiatrist/'mind healer' in town and really help people, that would work too.

Anyone who can alter memories can also read them. They could easily view the whole memory, then construct a near identical one with specific details changed or missing, compare the two, finetune the copy, and then replace the original with the copy. And they would be the only one who knew what the original was until ~two years later, by which time the target's soul will have finished healing the brain damage.

You could, but if they deleted their own memory of their illegal actions, you wouldn't be able to find it. There is also a location where you can't willingly lie or you die, but again, they could have just deleted the memory beforehand. If they made mistakes or just didn't take long enough to get all the details right, you might be able to confidently say that something was changed regarding xyz, but that would still not get you the original.

You do not feel the sudden change in velocity, but you any consequences of a high velocity affect you normally (Supersonic speeds relative to air hurt, reentry speed can cause massive burns, a velocity straight down still breaks your legs, ect). Not that snapping is not instantaneous, and repeated quick snapping can be physically strenuous.

Lets say the velocity does not have to be applied uniformly, so that you can use your snaps to change your rotational speed, and possibly even punch harder (as long as you avoid ripping your hand from your arm.)

There are fictional stories of people being so powerful that they are effectively walking nukes. Your power would put these people to shame, because you're a walking galaxy destroyer. Change your velocity to light-speed * (1 - 1/infinity) in the direction of the earth. It would kill you, but the nigh infinite amount of kinetic energy you inject into the Earth would also destroy it, sending fragments of the Earth out in all directions at nigh light-speed. And by fragments I don't mean just solid matter, I mean subatomic particles as well, because nigh-infinite kinetic energy will overpower the strong nuclear force with ease. These fragments will then repeat the process on everything they hit, eventually destroying the galaxy.

You may be a little short of a universe destroyer though, depending on whether the universe can expand faster than light forever.

#+end_quote

Oh! A safe way to apply your power. Apply a massive amount of velocity to a tiny patch of skin or hair, and it will fire off like a bullet and leave you only with the minor injury of losing some skin or hair. Don't apply too much velocity though, otherwise the above scenario happens and its not so safe for you after all. This unfortunately means very low velocities while on Earth, since you don't want your skin or hair to undergo nuclear fusion with the air surrounding you.

On the other hand, you would be unstoppable in space, being able to fire off near-light-speed projectiles safely through the vacuum of space to hit far away targets. You still can't apply near infinite amount of kinetic force without destroying the galaxy, but what you can apply safely is more than enough to destroy pretty much anything you want.

Consider using a tooth or a nail for extra lethality if this is somehow not enough.

**** Assuming you're in a version of our world in modern times (aside from this power existing), you will probably be using this power exclusively on earth. Then, assuming you don't want to kill yourself, your biggest constraint will be limiting objects to speeds that don't vaporize you when you fire them (and also limited in range by the object vaporizing itself and dispersing all its momentum into the air before it reaches its destination?)

Small objects like flecks of skin will probably vaporize really quickly and disperse their energy and momentum into a wider range of air, and act more like a beam cannon than a bullet, while larger objects like nails might maintain their structure more. But I'm mostly speculating based on that one XKCD what-if with the baseball.

Either way, the amount of energy you can impart is unbounded as you asymptotically approach lightspeed, the only question is how deadly can you get without killing yourself.

You can probably nuke a city (or anything smaller or larger) by getting a protective suit, launching yourself into the air, firing a fleck of skin at relativistic speeds towards the city through a small opening in the suit, then flinging yourself backwards at supersonic speeds to avoid the energy heat explosion, then slowing yourself down and landing once you reach a safe distance.

There, now I have a reasonably sturdy object I can apply arbitrary levels of force with. At that point, not much brainstorming is needed to have FUN.

*** If you can change your momentum without being affecting by sudden changes in momentum, then you have a perpetual machine.

One straight forward way to apply it, is to stand on a spoke of a water wheel or something similar that is standing still and snap your fingers to suddenly have a large velocity. Your body will forcibly push the water wheel into moving and thus harvest the kinetic energy into a usable form.

Granted this would damage your body, but it's an example of how to extract work from your power.

** You have a limited mind control power. Specifically, you can persuade anyone of anything in the course of a five minute one-one-one conversation, as long as it's something that you believe and it's something that actually is true. (If you're not completely sure about something, you can't make someone else more certain than you yourself are.) If you want to get more technical, it only works on things that you have "knowledge" of, where "knowledge" has the traditional philosopher's definition of "justified true belief". Attempting to persuade someone of anything else works exactly as well as it would if you did not have this power.

How do you exploit this?

**** Err, I don't think that would work. Just because you can convince anyone in a 5 minute one-on-one conversation doesn't mean that the exact same conversation would work for everyone. You might need to say things differently in response to different questions, and may need to say them at the right timing depending on the body language of the target, etc.

***** That may be true, but there are podcasts out there about two people arguing about an important topic which can convince viewers.

Even if the viewers aren't exactly the same person as your 'partner', there is likely to be a significant fraction of the audience who identify with your partner. You could even make it your gimmick. For every important topic there is to argue about, you make a series of videos talking to various individuals and the viewers simply choose the character they identify the best with.

For example, in the series 'Arguing Cryonics with...' there are videos such as 'Arguing Cryonics with a Democrat', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Republican', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Christian', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Preschooler', and so on for whatever section of the audience you want to reach.

This is assuming that you magically know the best arguments to persuade someone rather than just having them agree with you without you coming up with any arguments.

The audience won't be as well convinced, but I would assume some of the rhetorical impact would carry over.

*** If I'm not completely sure about something, I can find out whether it's true by seeing whether I can convince others of it. If it's hard to tell whether I have convinced them mundanely of something untrue, I still become more certain that it is true, because mundanely, I could have failed. Therefore, repeating it with different people should convince them more and more as I get more certain it's my power at work.

What do you mean, I'm unsafe? You mean that I might be corrupted by power and immanetize something rather dystopic instead? That possibility would be rather obvious and taken into account in the safety research part, in order to tease out of my oracle how to rule it out. You mean that the oracle might be untrustworthy? ...if the oracle chose me to be its vessel in order to acquire the universe, it could have chosen a vessel that wouldn't listen to people trying to tell it otherwise, so yeah, if the all-knowing entity is goal-directed and hostile we were screwed from the beginning, so we might as well assume it isn't.
