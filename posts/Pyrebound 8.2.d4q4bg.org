[[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/09/15/chapter-8-2/]]

Pyrebound is a serial about a boy who leaves home to seek his fortune in a terrible world, only to learn in intimate detail that the world is a lot more terrible than he thought. Magic ziggurats and shape-shifting war-engines are involved. A fuller synopsis I've gotten tired of copy-pasting is [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/][here]] and the first chapter starts [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thanks, all!


** Hmm... That was not particularly surprising. Definitely something we saw coming as a possibility. I'm more interested in the politics; these flamekeepers seem awfully nice compared to the ones from before. Different group? What was the purpose of sending him away, and is he *supposed* to come back? I don't think we're done with the twists yet.

*** No, we're not. But I did wonder how much of the audience expected something like this.

**** Honestly, it was fairly obvious that something along those lines was happening as soon as he started being able to boss indwelt objects around.

Which means what the Ensi did is the equivalent to taking a random street urchin and putting him on the throne a'la Prince and the Pauper. Not that our protagonist is really "random" given his sister and (possibly) his parents, but it's that kind of a move. Interesting to see what the fallout is from that and what reactions the Ensi is trying to provoke.

***** Huh. That's ... actually not an inference I expected or intended anybody to make. The one ability Ram has shown, which we can be reasonably sure handmaidens do not possess, is detecting other haranuu. Karagene handmaidens evidently couldn't spot him during his escape, and the Misishin handmaidens noticed nothing odd about him. As for subverting flamekeepers' authority over their weapons, how do you know Mana or Shennai couldn't do the same?

****** I suppose we do not know for sure that they couldn't do the same, but given the flamekeepers abject surprise when it happens I don't imagine that it is an ability that they are aware of. If any indwelt human had control over indwelt weapons, I feel that it would be obvious to them what occurred.

For that matter, the black scarves would certainly have sussed that out if it were even uncommon knowledge. It's far too useful an ability.

******* See, I don't think of it as an active ability--"subvert allegiance"--so much as how the haranuu think. Flamekeeper tries to take a swipe at Ram. Spirit senses that he's being aimed at a fellow spirit, says "oh heeeelll no" and refuses. Ram then picks up sword; spirit is momentarily confused, but trusts indwelt human more than non-indwelt human and complies with orders. Not something that gets used a lot, either way, since nobody is stupid or impious enough to draw on a handmaiden, the handmaiden wouldn't need a sword to make him hurt if he tried, and as far as anyone knows men don't get indwelt.

Kamenrag's last mistake is a different matter I don't want to get into right now. Anyway, it's good to know how it looks from the other side. Thanks!
