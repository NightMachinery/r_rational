Orange, a new trainer sets his sights on becoming /the/ Pokémon champion around the world but first he must conquer his home region, Kakuno. When he gets there he is offered any starter he likes if he helps Professor Ply with his research in the ‘battle bond phenomenon'. However he has noticed that some of his research has been going missing. He suspects that someone in his staff is planning on stealing it and taking the credit for his research themselves. Orange is expected to go out there and collect all the 100 samples of Pokémon dna and bring it back to the lab for study believing that it's a gene in the Pokémon that's the key for battle bonding. While unbeknownst to them a secret mafia of animal abusers known as ‘team force' in the criminal underworld is where the missing parts of the research has been going. Will Orange be the champion he wants to be or will he just remain a nobody in a nothing town?

Found out next time on Pokémon z

Btw didn't feel like creating 100+ Pokémon designs for a non canon region.

Any thoughts?


** If you're making this a rational/rationalist fic, it's missing a few things to really hook people I think. This being a rough outline means none of the things I'm bringing up are deal breakers. Just some things you should think about and maybe highlight more in your summary if you want to attract people who like rational fiction (Or at least me in particular... since I don't speak for everyone).

1) The idea of becoming "The Pokemon Champion" isn't really interesting on its own. You have to justify why a rational person would want to become the champion. What can be done with the postion? What are the perks of it? Are there any responsibilities? Why does the MC have this goal?

2) What exactly is a secret mafia of animal abusers? I'm assuming they're using pokemon in unethical ways for financial gain. Like excessive forced labor in poor living conditions. Or illegal gambling rings where pokemon fight to the death. Again, I want to know the motives behind what they're doing, even if it's just a broad overview. Otherwise it just sounds like they're evil for the sake of being evil.

3) This last one may not actually be a valid point depending on where you're taking the plot. But on the off chance that you have Professor Ply ask Orange for for help in investigating who is stealing his research, then you'll want to make sure you have justifications for this. Assuming Ply is a grown man and Orange is a kid, you'll need to have answers to the questions of "Why is a Pokemon Professor asking a kid with no experience for help with this situation?" "What abilities/qualifications does Orange have that would help in this kind of investigation?" "How did Orange gain those abilities at such a young age?"

But you can easily sidestep this issue by simply not having Ply ask Orange to help out with the research theft issue, unless he stumbles across it in his travels or something of that nature.

So to reiterate you've got the basic outline of a story that can potentially be interesting, but there's really not enough information here to say whether it will be or not. Nothing you've stated is necessarily "unrational" but without more details the story just seems like a normal pokemon fan fic set in a new region.

Maybe you already have a lot of the answers to these questions fleshed out in your mind, but if not I'd advise you to give all this some thought before you start writing. Good luck working on your story!

*** Thank you I've never gotten criticism for any of my stories since no one ever listens to them 🤷‍♂️ and I'll take all of this into consideration

Edit: also that's a good question these 10, 11 year old children are strangely competent for their age and why do these grown professors ask children for help?

**** In the few examples I've seen these questions answered reasonably well, the kids were more or less prodigies who had grown up living with/working with people who were experts in the field.

And even still the professors were more or less having them gather information by collecting pokemon as a means of giving them experience and simply for the sake of collecting raw data. The kids go to the professors and other experts for help usually, not the other way around. Though the kids still have interesting insights into how the world works on their own.

If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: Origin of Species]] I'd definitely check it out for the world building aspects of the story.

** "Stealing credit for research" is a little weird. Labs are expensive. And real-world research communities are fairly tight knit.

Maybe I could break into CERN/some bio lab. And maybe I could steal data. But if I sent it to a journal as "my" work, the senior editor is almost certainly going to just call my PI and ask what's up.

You could steal work has has some application, and then sell it to someone who wants the knowledge as a trade secret.

** Stop me if you've heard this one:

#+begin_quote
  You play as a child of indeterminate gender named [Color] who has just recently [turned ten/arrived from parts unknown] in [small town], which happens to be within easy walking distance from a Pokemon Lab, where Professor [tree] does his work, specifically specializing in [gimmick]. By lucky coincidence, you happen to meet this professor, who mostly unprompted offers you the opportunity to help him in his research by finding a bunch of animals for him to look at. By way of compensation, he offers you a pet attack animal of your very own and maybe some technological gizmo if you're lucky. Also, you want to beat the Pokemon League and defeat some tangentially related criminal organization.
#+end_quote

It's not even a good MadLib, there isn't enough variability for even that. You haven't yet written anything that hasn't already been written... what are we on now like 8 times over?

I'm not saying that you're uncreative, but I am saying that this so far demonstrates no creativity. If you have some unique ideas, then you have to tell us what they are if you want useful feedback. What are you doing differently?

*** Touché. Originally it was this whole story about this 13 y/o boy (still named Orange) and his journey to the top of being this weak nervous wreck of a kid to a competent almost veteran trainer by the time he was 16 mainly focusing on him going through the gym leaders, league competitions, and league champions. Trying, failing, almost quitting and dying by trying to help to defeat the organizations in each region but getting told he was too young and inexperienced and just a kid to include himself in adult matters. I didn't quit the story I just wanted to post the 4th part of it online to see if the battle bond gimmick would actually be a good idea. But I get what you mean for me it's more about the execution of it all.

Oh. Well if the gimmick is all you wanted advice on, you should have just asked for that. It's probably one of the best directions you could take that element of the story, simply because the source material is so deeply steeped in "Power of Friendship" shonen-ness. Examining that methodically and scientifically is an interesting premise for bringing a more rational look to the classic Pokemon Adventure.

It also makes an interesting counterpoint to the villain group you've suggested that practices animal abuse. It will be hard to play it straight, but I think the less of a joke you make it, the funnier it will be to the reader: hundreds of man-hours, years of work, who knows how much money all spent in getting a spy into the most prestigious research facility in the region to steal the results of the famous professor's work, and what is this secret that they've come back with after so great an investment of time and resources? Well it seems that Professor Ply has finally proven empirically that treating your Pokemon kindly and not abusing them makes them better at fighting.

That part of it is actually pretty good. I just don't think it will carry it if that's the only part of the formula you change.

Edit: Actually, I think Team Force trying to change their internal organizational culture, dealing with internal conflict that would cause is a way more interesting story prompt than whatever Orange is up to. Violence against their Pokemon is firstly what defines them as an organization, without that what is even the point of being a member of Team Force if you aren't going to act like it?

And all those gangsters who have told themselves for years that they beat their Poochyena to make it fight better when it's really just because they're violent people who need an outlet for their aggression, do you think they'll just admit they were wrong and stop? No, they'll find some way to blame anyone but themselves. The minute someone says "the boss went soft and he's just lying to us", they'll latch on to that story with both hands and never let it go. They'll form splinter groups, and suddenly instead of one gang with a stranglehold over the region's underworld, you instead have a gang war. People will die over this.

And what about new members? Part of the point of petty, unprofitable, but socially heinous crimes like animal abuse being part of organized crime is as an initiation of sorts. How do we know we can trust the new guy? If the new guy doesn't have to abuse his Pokemon, then he's innocent of any crimes, and if we get busted by the cops, he'll sing like a Chatot knowing he'll get off smelling like a Roselia. No, we'll just have to have him do something else instead. Maybe the new initiation can just be violence against someone else's Pokemon, we'll have the new kid kill some other trainer's team of Rattatas. Or just kick the shit out of some random civilian, like gangsters do. Either way, showing them the true power of friendship has led directly to a sudden spike in the rate of violent crime across the region, good job.

***** Nah more it was more a subversion (in the good way) of these kids being even more competent than adults when it comes to taking down serious issues to their country or region and such. That's why I bumped up the protagonists age up so he's a couple years older than all the protagonists when they start and he constantly fails and almost dies multiple times. Instead of ya know an 11 year old taking down an entire criminal organization by himself. Then having another kid finish them off a short while later. It's through repeated failures and multiple training styles that Orange actually finds his way. But thank you *very much* for your input very appreciated.

Edit: holy shit that plot point sounds great as fuck
