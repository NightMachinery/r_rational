Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So I'm looking for advice on how to write realistic combat.

You know how in regular fiction, heroes defeat the bad guys by knocking them out? Or how no matter how much the protagonist bleeds and breaks his legs, he just keeps running forward through sheer willpower? Or how the good guys can recover from any amount of damage so long as they don't die?

Yeah, I don't like that sorta stuff; I'd like to try and learn how to write realistic, messy combat in a world with super powers.

At what point does a person suffer brain damage from head trauma or getting knocked out?

How much can limbs function on broken bones?

When is a limb rendered unusable?

How do you write someone falling from high up and getting splattered on a surface?

Or getting crushed by falling debris?

At what point does blood loss become a serious concern?

What about damage to internal organs?

What's the process of recovering from mild or extreme injuries like?

How do you write someone during and after shock from being placed in a life or death situation?

What about PTSD?

How much punishment can the body take before it starts shutting down?

What about maiming and dismemberment?

Or falling into a coma, and recovering from one?

How do you write about person A trying to help person B who is injured or in critical condition and there's no one else around to help?

How do you write first aid in general?

What about physiotherapy and dealing with losing limbs?

​

What I'm saying is: how do you realistically write all the messy, gory and traumatic details of deadly combat and natural disasters that media like anime and such completely gloss over in favor of punching baddies in the face?

​

Yeah I know it's a bit morbid and all, but still.

I'd uhh... appreciate it if you guys could point me in the right direction. I'm willing to do research to improve my writing.

Just thought I'd ask here since rationality an realism seem to go hand in hand.

*** Actual fights are over very quickly. Even a minor injury means you can't fight effectively, and if you got injured in the first place then you were already losing. And hand to hand combat is incredibly tiring: if somehow neither party gets injured, combatants will be too fatigued to adequately defend themselves within a couple minutes. This is why combat sports have rounds; I can tell you from first-hand experience that a minute of Tae Kwon Do sparring is about three eternities long.

Large scale combat and war is much slower, not because the actual fighting is any longer, but because you spend loads of time positioning and waiting around for the fighting to start. By all accounts this is an awful combination of incredibly boring and incredibly stressful.

If you want an in-depth understanding of the mechanics of injury and first aid, I'd recommend taking first aid courses, even working your way up to EMT training. It's something people can do in their free time, and learning it is a net benefit to society.

*** I don't have a lot of info but avoid tranquilizers and being knocked out.

Applying tranquilizers is an entire job irl (anesthetist) and even when all of modern tech sometimes people die. Real life tranquilizers also tend to be pretty slow acting, so sleep darts aren't going to work.

Knockouts are similar. Being knocked out is a big deal -- your brain is being shocked so hard it shuts down. Clobbering someone over the head will probably just kill them, or leave them with long term injuries.

*** If you want to get a feel yourself I recommend watching MMA and reading memoirs of combat medics/doctor's. You can also find live combat footage online, but they are very intense. You could also take a emergency responder course to cover the medical side.

TLDR: The human body can temporarily tolerate incredibly bad changes, but freak accidents happen all the time. Combat generally lasts much longer than people think but the break points/action happens very quickly. People also value their lives much more than the public would expect.

1.  People appear to suffer brain damage from any moderate impact to the head (pro football players show signs of damage from headers for example). Most knock outs come from dramatic impacts that move the whole head, either from sheer impact or the angle of force. People "lightly" knocked out, from boxer vs boxer punches for example, will have a altered mental state after waking up but they recover* over days/weeks. Headaches, fatigue, and mood swings throughout. More severe knock outs could be anything from just worse symptoms or symptoms that never go away to stroke-like effects. All non-technical knock outs are due to a concussion being bad enough to effectively require your brain to reboot, if it can. Blood chokes <2min generally don't cause permanent brain damage, past that effects get very bad fast. People either wake up from knock outs relatively quickly or not at all (without treatment). Avoid using long term unconsciousness outside of magic, a knockout then coming to in cuffs is the edge of realism.

2.  Some people can tolerate crazy things on broken bones, adrenaline+shock is a hell of a drug. That being said structural damage is structural damage, you just can't run with a fully broken femur since the bone won't hold. Broken bones are extremely painful outside of the short term though, soldiers won't fight with broken ribs after things calm down for example.

3.  Limbs are unusable if they can't handle forces transfered through them, such as a broken arm bone unable to support picking up a weight, if their muscles or attachments can't create or transfer enough force, or if usage causes intolerable pain.

4.  Google it but I don't think people really splatter. The impact concusses them hard enough to kill or breaks their neck in a lethal way. Or they break a bunch of bones, typically become paralyzed, and have a lot of internal bleeding. A lot of bridge jumpers die from internal bleeding/drowning. From suicide attempt accounts there's always panic on the way down.

5.  A heavy impact out of the blue, you suddenly realize you are hit/crushed and try to deal with it. Hope the weight isn't on your chest or blocking blood flow anywhere. Crush injuries are very bad.

6.  Medically: when blood pressure starts dropping, when hypoxia is apparent. As you lose blood your body tries to pump what it has faster and at a higher pressure to compensate, when that fails you're dying fast. 10 pints of blood in a person, 1 pint loss is a blood donation, 2 is light headed but you can be ok, 3-4 you're mentally out of it can't catch your breath clammy, 5+ and you're dying. 2+ is a concern and your abilities tank.

7.  Unless it's the lungs just immediately worry about the bleeding. Other organ damage you can't do much without a surgeon and damage will either kill you slower or on the spot(brain/heart). Evisceration is incredibly nasty but still the #1 is bleeding then get a surgeon.

8.  Very dependent on the injury but it takes a long time and never gets back to 100%. Treatment, close care, released care and rehab.

9.  During focus on the situation, fixate on details, or get swept up in it. After varies a lot.

10. Varies a lot, the effects are less obviously connected to combat than people think. It's easier to think of it as several mental disorders combined. A lot more sleep disorders than people think.

11. The body can tolerate a lot until it just can't then you start dying fast. Think of it like hypothermia, your body is pretty good at resisting the cold, you're shivering and curled up, but your temperature creeps down until you hit a point. After that your thermoregulation fails, your temperature starts plummeting and you decide you need to take all your clothes off. A lot of systems are like that.

12. Short term=blood loss. Also dismemberment/maiming is very mentally scarring.

13. The coma is caused by something very bad, that needs to be fixed and you likely need a doctor to recover.

14. A lot of panic, half remembered things you were taught and "know". Thinking about what you can and can't do anything about.

15. See 14, emphasis on the limited things you can treat. Everything falling apart from the blood and need to be fast.

I personally get stuck on how fast people die in media sometimes, especially from melee weapons. People don't fight until they drop dead, and people injured enough to be disabled can hold on for a long time. After every medieval battle there has to have been a huge amount of post battle execution of enemy wounded on the field. Also general portrayals of people not valuing their life in combat.

I think if you know the real versions of these things you can work around them in fiction with magic or tweaking scenarios. Just beating someone until they surrender is a huge difference vs knocking them out for example.

Edit: I've also heard the recommendation to go play small team paintball shirtless after pulling an all nighter to get a taste of the fear, exhaustion, and skills breakdown. YMMV but it sounds both miserable and hilarious!

*** It really does depend on willpower, kind of. There are instances of people through adrenaline simply soldiering life threatening injuries. However most people don't handle pain all that well.

If you want realistic combat, than start off by making it short. The fight ends when the hero gets punched in the jaw sending him reeling. His broken leg leaves him paralyzed with pain. A limb doesn't even have to be broken to be unusable if it's damaged or hurt in a way in that makes it too painful to use. A punch to gut leaves him heaving.

Broken limbs, depending on how they're injured might never heal the same way either. It really does depend on a whole host of circumstances. Some people have had arms torn off by machinery only to get it reattached with relative ease. Others have had had broken bones or torn muscles that leave their limbs permanently weaker. Career ending injuries are a thing for a reason.

Getting knocked unconscious is generally speaking a pretty serious deal, mainly because it requires that you be hit so hard that your brain gets rattled and short circuits. Knocking someone unconscious is never a good idea mainly because there's a decent chance they'll never wake up again. Even if they do, they might have some form of permanent damage. I would suggest looking up the symptoms of cumulative brain damage experienced by boxers as a good example. The same logic applies to anesthetic and other drugs. Add too little and they might not feel anything, add just a little more and you've killed them.

For sources, there are plenty of real life stories involving people who have been through grievous injuries and lived. This includes any health problems they might have.

*** Here are some things I've learnt: - If one party has a weapon and the other doesn't, the first party will more likely win. - If one person weighs more, that person will most likely win, even if they are grossly out of shape. - There is nothing stopping you from carrying a Jo ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8D]]) around in your daily life, except social acceptability, and you can just spend the weirdness points. - Training in martial arts is often bullshit, but actual masters do know something. - If one person doesn't do exercise, they will run out of breath pretty quickly. - You can increase your resistance to pain. - Pinnings are a thing. - Learning to fall is often one of the first things you learn.

Lastly: - If you want to kill someone, you stab them while they're sleeping, or in a sneak attack, rather than beating them in a duel with your superior skill. - Corollary: If someone challenges to a duel, you run, and stab them in their sleep another day. Or, in general, running is often a good idea.

And another thing... If such fights are expected to happen relatively often, how does the shape of your society look like, and why? - Are there deterrents? Maybe strong kin networks that discourage this kind of thing? Clans? Police? - Why doesn't your protagonist just submit/admit defeat? - The cost of killing someone, or making an enemy, is often relatively high. Why is that the best thing your competent antagonist can do with their time? - Why aren't people killed in their sleep? / Why don't main characters live in bunkers / why don't they surround themselves with praetorian guards? - Is there poison, or gases which can knock people out?

**** While its totally true that carrying a weapon will make you far more likely to win in a fight, note that having a gun (and presumably other weapons) on you will also make you more likely to die or be severely injured in said fight due to it escalating the conflict and changing how you react to the situation.

Presumably your win scenario is not dying (as opposed to not getting robbed or beaten up or whatever), so carrying a weapon in most circumstances in the modern world is actually a bad idea.

*** The way that *Worm* (Wildbow) deals with this, is that while villains are greedy and amoral, most of them don't actually want to kill people. The Travellers, for example, are villains because they allied with the only person who agreed to help them achieve the nearly-impossible. They frequently get in tussles with heroes, and many of them have highly deadly powers. They typically find creative ways to use the powers to block off their opponents' options, rather than directly attacking.

** I see posts asking about rational anime from time to time, and I'd like to propose one that I haven't seen mentioned here before: */Hunter x Hunter/* (2011)

There are a lot of things to like about it: the challenges tend to be resolved rationally, whether by fighting or avoiding a fight. The learning curve is especially well portrayed, and the MC shows intelligent goal-setting. The magic system is (mostly) consisent and characters have believable and consistent motivations. Some of the scenes are so brilliant they will bring a tear to your eye! I always cry during the 3rd ep when Gon understands the true meaning of the impossible question the team is asked. So rationally beautiful!

There are a few problems with it though, especially WRT the worldbuilding. I don't want to go into detail and influence what you don't like, but some of the macro-scale stuff doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The show was written serially so as the writers came up with more fleshed-out ideas in later seasons, it was too late to go back and change details about what happened earlier. /Most/ of the flaws can be wallpapered over with some slignt headcanon changes IMO, and imagining those changes doesn't bother me, considering hoe great the good parts are.

If you don't mind overlooking a little bit of bad for a whole lot of good, I recommend watching! (I'll note that the series gets good on episode 2, I feel the first episode is childish and dumb. So don't worry if you don't like the first one, the series gets good fast from that point).

*** The world building flaws are not due to writers, but the original manga by Yoshihiro Togashi, and in fact this is a flaw shared by his earlier hit Yu Yu Hakusho (also a good watch). I think he just likes to plow forward and retcon things as he goes along. Also worth noting that if you enjoyed the anime, HxH is still continuing as a manga, albeit extremely slowly.

If you're looking for fiction similar to HxH, I'd heavily recommend The Zombie Knight Saga. It even has the bizarre early world building and lengthy hiatuses of the original!

  NASA's new Internet and social media special, NASA at Home, will show and engage you in the agency's discoveries, research, and exploration from around the world and across the universe -- all from the comfort of your own home.

  NASA at Home offers something for the whole family. It brings together a repository of binge-worthy videos and podcasts, engaging E-books on a variety of topics, do-it-yourself projects, and virtual and augmented reality tours, which include the agency's Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station, as well as an app that puts you in the pilot's seat of a NASA aircraft.

  “We know people everywhere, especially students, are looking for ways to get out of the house without leaving their house,” said Bettina Inclán, associate administrator for NASA's Office of Communications. “NASA has a way for them to look to the skies and see themselves in space with their feet planted safely on the ground, but their imaginations are free to explore everywhere we go. We've put that information at their fingertips. We hope everyone takes a few moments to explore NASA at Home.”

  This special also spotlights educational and entertaining resources and activities for families and students in kindergarten and up. Plus, it provides access to everything from formal lesson plans to amazing imagery and stories about how science and exploration help the world.

  If you want to practice safe science at home, we have opportunities for citizen scientists to contribute to real ongoing research, from our solar system's backyard to your own backyard. This includes searching for brown dwarfs and planets in our outer solar system and helping track changes in clouds, water, plants, and other life in support of climate research.

  NASA at Home will feature ongoing opportunities to interact and hear from agency experts. For example, record-breaking astronaut Christina Koch reads children's books weekdays at 4 p.m. EDT on Instagram live as part of educational and STEM activity for students.

  NASA Television also is running NASA at Home-themed programming 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays, as well as broadcasting around-the-clock with recent mission events and news, conversations with astronauts on the International Space Station, educational looks at science, technology and exploration topics, and historical programs from the agency's storied past.

  So, check in regularly with #NASAatHome for the latest and greatest the universe has to offer!

*** There's no strong evidence in support of hydroxychloroquinine for now. It may or may not have some minor benefits that could become evident with further testing in ongoing trials, but side effects and impact in overall mortality rates among COVID-19 patients receiving it will also need to be evaluated. Per Yao et al. (Mar 9 2020), "Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection". Per McCreary & Pogue (Mar 23 2020), "...there are currently no efficacy data available for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19...". It's worth continuing to investigate it for potential benefits, but it has been tested enough to show that it's not a miracle cure, and it would be dishonest to hype it up that way.

I would recommend at least skimming through the article by McCreary & Pogue, since it does a good job of covering all the various candidate drugs and what kind of testing has been completed or is underway. They also go into a lot more detail regarding hydroxychloroquinine if you're more interested in that drug specifically.
