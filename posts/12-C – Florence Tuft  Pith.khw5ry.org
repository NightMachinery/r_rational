** And two more out of the game. At least, they're not dead this time. As far as I know, the only two remaining are the Symphony knight and the Headmaster. I wonder if they'll win against her or lose too.

  “Professor,” said Ana. “We could have avoided much of this if you paid me fairly.”

Ana, please take this idea and run with it. The Humdrums in the navy sure did.

Speaking of, the fact that no one even considered the idea that the largely Humdrum navy might turn traitor for the revolutionary group fighting for (among other things) Humdrum rights is a great example of Paragon's ideological blinders fucking them over. They genuinely can't conceive of their opponents as people making informed decisions. To them, every member of Commonplace is an inscrutable creature with alien values hellbent on the destruction of the Principality for unknowable reasons, so the idea that Commonplace's ideology might actually appeal to some people doesn't even occur to them. Paragon doesn't even think of Commonplace as /having/ an ideology, it's just a barbarian horde, and I laugh every single time that bites them in the ass.

** So Florence is out for good seeing as she can't switch to a new body. Isaac might be saved or might die. That just leaves Rowyna from the old gang.

** Who are you guys rooting for in this series?

I wanted to root for Anabelle, but she is just so indoctrinated it is painful to watch. She lacks direction and so she latches onto what she has been taught and pushes away or ignores anything that contradicts her world views.

Tunnel Vision has the goals I like the most, but like her nomme de guerre, she only focuses on the end goal and has become a monster. I was really hoping Ana had been projecting her body fraud on commonplace incorrectly and that they wouldn't stoop so low, but it seems like Tunnel Vision has used some unethical fundraising strategies.

I think I'm just rooting against Paragon and the government that is supported/supports it. We've just seen so much abuse by them that I just want it to burn to the ground.

*** I'm not really giving the moral high ground to either side of the big picture - I'm just rooting for the correction/vindication of smaller but morally unambiguous wrongs - like, I'm fine with Tunny taking down the echelin reaponsible for the fake narrative that painted (and possibly /made her/) into the Pyre Witch, but I afterwards I also want Ana to take Tunny down because hustling the terminally ill is a big nono in my book.

Also go Tasia, because her plotline seems the most interesting to me.

**** Ideal situation is that Tunny wreaks the level of destruction she was after, dies, and whatever is left rebuilds into something that doesn't fuck up as badly fast enough that it isn't curbstomped.

I've only read a few chapters, but the academy headmaster is the only person who isn't obviously evil or morally apathetic so far.

*** I think Jun was recently in a redemption camp, right?, meaning they're still in practice. So Grace's Path to Victory is probably still freeing everyone from the redemption camps. But I don't think it's been explicitly confirmed that this is the case, so there might be a twist

Purely ideologically I think Commonplace is right vs Paragon and the Epistocrats, but both sides have done completely awful things that it makes it hard to unequivocally root for either. I think it's probably easiest to root for Queen Sulphur but as pov characters it's easy for a reader to be biased towards them. Or maybe Tasia but she's kind of a cop-out answer since she's not a major player

*** I feel like all the stuff which tunnel vision has done is justified in the face of what she's fighting. I mean who cares if you con a few german civilians if it means stopping the nazis from total and indefinite world domination?

**** Tunnel vision's goals I feel are a net positive to the harm she is doing, but it's not just conning a few civilians. The chapter where Maxine murders the bright eyed newly admitted Paragon student was tough to read. The domestic terrorism is also despicable, but I'm not sure how much of that was actually the green circle and how much of it was Paragon to discredit their cause.

***** The nudging of civillians into kamikazes is one of the most unambiguousky evli things she's done (or ordered done).

Also scamming Ana, if it's true. Scamming terminally ill civillian children with defective organs just sits very very wrong with me, no matter what you want to put the scam money towards.

*** The central clique of Commonplace can tongue a waffle iron for all I care. All that matters is that the people get their shot to cast down their oppressors. After that's done you can leave their more fucked up actions in the dust-bin of history along with all the other abuses done towards Humdrums.
