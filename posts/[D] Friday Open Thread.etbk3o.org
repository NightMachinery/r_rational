Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Big thank you to everyone who helped come up with weird planet ideas for Space Trains last week! I've decided to [[http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html][share the in-progress version of it]] with this community. Warnings: Doesn't work well on mobile yet, even worse "One more turn" symptoms than Civ.

Currently trying to figure out what I want the endgame to be. Priorities are replayability, distinction between runs, stories worth sharing, and ending on a high note. I'm increasingly thinking I want to add a third tier of resources, but that just postpones the endgame question rather than answering it.

Edit: I got enough feedback on how confusing it is below, so a quick tutorial:

Click a planet to select a project. Projects are listed as "list, of, requirements => thing it produces." Each time you meet a new batch of requirements, the planet's range (rail hops) increases by one. Most projects start with range one, but a few need to have their first requirement met first. Factory planets are not natural, you'll have to industrialize/mechanize to get them.

**** Can you walk me through what parts you found confusing?

I think tutorials are the last thing that a game should add; they solve too many problems that are ideally solved through iconography and mechanics, removing the pushback to just do those better.

And it does need to do better; the initial learning curve is a bit much.

***** Well. All of it was confusing.

The game opens by showing you a bunch of planets. When you click one, a menu opens, full of a bunch of symbols, words and colors, none of which have any real explanation.

It's not hard to figure out that you can use this to assign a planet to a task, and that some resources on some planets will help other planets out.

Where this gets weird, is when you assign a planet to something, and it makes stuff without the required resources.

Like, opening a game of it now, I have the option to make a hive world. Based off the symbols I'm seeing, it looks like it will convert 3 food and one stack of cube things into a person.

Then, I can make a farm world next to that, which seems to say that it will take three people and a tentacle to produce a food.

But the moment I build both worlds, they start sending resources to each other. Despite neither of them seeming to have the required materials.

Not only does it seem like they should not have any food or people at all yet, because none have been made, they sure as heck don't have any cube things or tentacles.

So, I don't really understand how the supply chain works, but more than that, I don't even know how to get some materials.

Like, robots and wrenches, seem to be things that I only very rarely get the chance to make. I /think/ that maybe it like, requires me to have a mining planet set up nearby to even show the option? Or something?

Oh, and it looks like some resources are kept track of in the bottom right corner? The science one I understand, but why do I need to know my total population? What does production do? What is a "turn"?

Okay, just tested it, looks like "turn" means "how many times I've assigned a planet to something". Seems like some weird terminology.

My guess is that having these stats higher unlocks things? But science is the only one that says how much I need for the next unlock.

And all of this is made worse when you realize that not only does there not seem to be any way (that I have found) to reassign a planet, but also that you are working with a finite number of planets. Many times now, I seem to have been locked out of further progression because I have tons of planets that can't get the resources they need, and I can't assign any more planets.

****** Neat, thanks for the detailed feedback! I have some ideas how to improve it from there.

The left side of a planet's project is the list of things it needs to upgrade. Commas between upgrades. Each time it upgrades, it increases the range it can send its resource by one. Most projects start with the ability to send things one hop along the graph.

The industrialize / mechanize projects convert planets into factory planets, which make several of the resources.

Most of the stats in the lower right don't do anything except change the music (game's not done yo). I'll hide them until they're more relevant.

***** First I'd like to say that the game is very fun and surprisingly addictive. I like the problem solving aspect and the way it encourages planning ahead.

Feedback:

My experience was that puzzling out the mechanics took me multiple tries of restarting the game, each time fooling around more to discover what the icons represented.

It took some experimentation to figure out that:

- The resource icons to the left of the arrows represented /requirements/, while icons on the right represented /rewards/.

- After I realized that, it took me a while longer to figure out that the number of resource icons in the reward section represented /how far/ each resource can travel rather than /how many/ of each resource is rewarded.

- The grey colors of the Robots and Technology resource icons were close enough to the grey 'resource not available' color that I was often confused about whether I had enough of those resources.

- When the science 'choice of reward' popup appears it would be nice if I could minimize it to review the mix of available planets/resource/upgrade requirements before deciding. That way I could make a more informed decision about strategy.

*** That's a damn good prototype.

The 3 turns delays for industrialisation/terraforming/etc. is annoying, because I have to find something else to do (possibly in a distant part of the map) and then forget what my plans were.

Not sure what the endgame should be either. Right now, because every planet only gets activated 2 or 3 times, you gradually paint yourself into a corner, which is interesting as a puzzle but kind of frustrating and anticlimactic as a game.

For research choices it's pretty hard to tell which ones will be any good to you. It doesn't help that you can't check your planets while you choose (and in the early game most planets are hidden anyway).

Agreed on research. I need to add a "later" button to it.

I'm not certain what to do with the three turn industrialization delay. I like it thematically, and in the early game I enjoy how it encourages you to juggle your focus. In the late game, juggling your focus is annoying busywork.

*** This game is amazing, and my first playthrough not knowing how things worked was still really fun. I think that is more important than having a tutorial that doesn't let you get into the meat of the game or enjoy it for a long time as has become really common.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Right now, /if/ I understand all the mechanics, there is no reward/incentive for super-funding/supplying your planets (aside from increased rail-travel for their outputs, which just allows further increase to various planets inputs). One way to go with an end-game would be for the total economic output of the system to be tracked by some ancillary resource ( a distinct currency, or "victory points", or something) which interacts with the rest of the game via distinct mechanics. Maybe total output at various levels earns vicotry points, and 10 victory points is a win, with lower turn-numbers being a measure of how good a run one has. Or maybe the game plays until you're out of valid moves, and a good run is one in which relatively many "victory points" have been earned.

Or maybe the currency allows development of planets/technologies/something else(?) along a parallel or orthogonal line from the rest of the game, and this secondary system must be built up in opposition to a developing "losing event': for instance, perhaps a black hole is growing at the center of the galaxy and you need to develop enough X(t) or Y(t) or Z(t) by turn t in order to stop galactic implosion; or the same but with a star about to go quasar; or similar, but with an invading alien fleet (perhaps enough "food crystal" development allows a diplomatic solution or enough "robotic super solider" allows a military victory); or all 3 + more of these with a random and initially unknown selection of a "losing event" each game which must be discovered mid-game and overcome in the late game.

I actually think I solved this. I uploaded a version with an endgame late last night! You can find your choice of two endgames at the end of the tech tree. I'll add a third one eventually.

On my first play through I was confused and didn't get any upgrades for planets, but on my last play through I managed to cascade upgrades for many of my inner planets! The cascade stopped once my inner planets needed wafers and spaceships and I couldn't figure out how to create the needed resources.

** Do you ever have an idea for a possible invention/scientific discovery/whatever that you think is genius and unprecedented and later find out that already exists? Or worse, you already definitely knew about it and somehow forgot about it?

Isn't that the fucking worst?!

When it pops up in your mind you think it's an ex nihilo product of your marvelous intellect, but it's actually just an undigested thought turd floating to the surface of your subconcious. Ex excreto? Ex creto?

Anyway, I ask because I'm currently in the "is this a genuinely promising and original idea I've come up with, or is this just another subconcious floater?" phase, and it is a phase which I'm so burn out on that I often just dismiss most ideas before even looking into it properly. I sometimes ask myself how many ideas with potential I thoughtlessly dismissed, and while I know that statistically the answer is probably none, you can't really know for sure, can you?

As I've grown older I've come to realize just how important dogged perseverance and especially mental resiliency towards failure is for being a successful outlier in highly competitive/saturated fields such such as art, sports, science, technology, etc.

Humans are naturally risk averse, they tend to play not to lose rather than to win. Why are we risk averse? Two factors I think, the first being that risk as we've known it for most of human existence has led to death, or painful injury and then to certain death. The second is that we're social creatures and our social status is highly important to our mental well-being. Being less risk averse than normal can be a major advantage in non-lethal pursuits such as these. The distance from median to the dirt is much less than median to the sky, after all, and it's not like the floor is that bad (if you have an adequate support structure to fall back on).

In fact, they say that narcissists/psychopaths tend to be inordinately represented among successful outliers, and besides the lack of empathy(a huge advantage in many fields, I'm sure), the ability to have a stable and lofty self-image regardless of failures and negative social pressure is probably immense.

--------------

Er... I've gone a bit far afield from the original topic(cryto-plagirism, was it?) and my lunch time is over. Teach your kids mental resiliency and perseverance by letting them(encouraging them!) to fail, it will be invaluable. I wish I had some of that growing up.

** Is the standard litRPG ruleset based on any actual video game? Some very common rules are rare to non-existent in the video games I know, but I don't play Asian MMOs...

I'm thinking of

- do a thing for the first time to unlock a skill (seems difficult to implement when players' interactions with the world have to go through a UI you can't experiment with; plus internet guides would spoil everything)

- skills have independent XP; use a skill repeatedly to level it up (The Elder Scrolls games do this but few others. Grinding single actions is boring, often even more so to litRPG characters. Making a lot of litRPG all about patience and willpower, which is a weird trope for a videogame adaptation when you think about it)

- passive skills like damage reduction or extra mana recovery that level when you take damage / recover mana (literally never seen this)

- do a rare feat to acquire a "title", which has a mechanical effect but you only have one active at a time (I've sometimes seen achievements with mechanical effects but it's unusual and always just permanent)

- class evolution, with prerequisites for the best ones (on tabletop, 4th edition D&D does this, but it wasn't very influential; also 3rd edition prestige classes and their videogame adaptations kinda)

Relatedly, is the "dungeon core" concept entirely derived from Dungeon Keeper? Is it all because of Dungeon Keeper Ami or were there other forerunners?

It too seems to have accrued lots of idiosyncratic rules, like "unlock a thing the first time you encounter it" (resulting in many nature-themed starts). Or "bait adventurers then kill them to gain mana", when in Dungeon Keeper you're self-sufficient and have a purely hostile relationship with the outside world. (Also cores are tiny stone spheres now?)

These games have skills with independent EXP (Fishing, Cooking, Skinning, Firemaking, ...). As for "Grinding single actions is boring".. yes! These games were essentially you just clicking in one fixed pattern for a month to get max level. In one single skill. I don't know what was so appealing about that, but it was.

As for Dungeon Core stories, I believe they (including DKA) are based on the video game "Dungeon Keeper"; you can find let's plays on YouTube for this game, it helps visualize what's going on in the stories.

There are also some tabletop games that do this, with the first that comes to mind being one of the editions of Call of Cthulhu (I'd have to check my bookshelves).

Class evolution /probably/ comes from D&D, but I think another point of comparison might be the talent trees from World of Warcraft which allow specialization, or how the job system sometimes works in the Final Fantasy games (which I would argue are one of the biggest non-MMO influences on litRPGs).

*** My understanding of the dungeon core thing is that it started as a writing prompt on a forum. Dungeon Keeper Ami was one of the original responses, and the one that ended up continuing into a long story, while some of the other responses ended up constructing the core tropes that later stories in the genre almost all use.

*** Do a thing to unlock a skill: I'm sure I've seen this before but I can't find any specific versions. A real game's implementation would be either something you actually have already, hidden, at level 0 (you don't discover unarmed until you attack something without a weapon), or something with a quest/npc trigger (talk to sage to learn magic).

Skills have independent xp: This was really common in early WRPGs, like Ultima Online.

Passive skill leveling: Here's one in [[https://www.uoforum.com/wiki/index.php/Meditation][Ultima Online]]. In roguelikes, I think Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup has had this at some point, but it sounds like something the devteam would have removed by now.

Do a rare feat to get a title: [[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Achievement_System][Ragnarok Online]] gives you stats for achievements.

Class evolution: This is much more popular in eastern games. [[https://irowiki.org/wiki/Classes][Ragnarok Online did it]]. It was a plot point in the very first Final Fantasy, so it's been around ages.

** I'm thinking about writing a Transformers rational fic, but I need to know a few things first!

First, how much of the original source material do I need to have seen first? I've only seen the Bumblebee movie with my family, and I haven't seen the original cartoons. (But I may see the other live action Transformers movies because of this!) Will calling my story 'massively AU' be okay with unaware Transformers fans?

Second, are there any requirements before I can call my story rational fiction? I plan to put an emphasis on characters thinking their actions through and the worldbuilding being realistic (to an extent). But I'm not aiming to teach about rationality because I want to focus on Transformers and the story. Should my story just be called 'rational-inspired'?

Thanks for reading my questions! When I saw the Bumblebee movie, the concept totally captured my imagination and I couldn't stop thinking about how the story could be improved. I really want to share my ideas in a way that is entertaining to others and is personally satisfying to myself as well. I really appreciate any advice given to me so that I can write my story!😊

*** Typically when people say they are fans of Transformers from a narrative perspective, they're talking about the original television series. I'm not trying to gatekeep you here, but the movies typically lose out compared to the cartoons when it comes to worldbuilding. I haven't seen Bumblebee, so I couldn't tell you if it's true for that one as well. What matters is that the type of person invested enough to read Transformers fanfiction is going to be going in expecting something resembling the cartoons. I'm not saying to watch all of them, but maybe get a beta reader who has? Someone to bounce ideas off of, so you don't accidentally reinvent something the shows did better.

As for rational fiction, the only requirement that /really/ matters is that the characters work in honest pursuit of their goals. I give very few shits about how good the plot is - all I care about is whether or not the characters are avoiding obvious self-sabotage.

**** Thank you so much! I'll keep in mind that the average Transformers fans watch the cartoons instead of the movies. I'll probably read the wiki for Transformers so that I understand the source material better and have a grasp on more characters. And I was always planning to avoid relying on main characters mistakes for the plot, so I'm glad that's all I'll need to write rational fiction. Thanks again!
