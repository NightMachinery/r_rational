** Seems like they should give Roshi one dragon ball anyways, even if he is o n offense. As noted earlier, things only matter if you gather all of them, and that splits their chances of a sneak attack breaking into the vault.

** How in HFIL did I miss the previous one?

It occurred to me while reading the Goku-Tao fight that Goku's ever-aloft spiky hair would function kinda like whiskers, or discount antennae, and help him to detect slower-than-sound movement all around him. This of course comes with the tradeoff of having lots of easily-grabbed hair sticking out in all directions. Bald characters with actual whiskers / antennae / Chaozu's curlyqueue would get a sensory advantage without so much gaping vulnerability (though in Chaozu's case, the hat renders it pointless, but I'm sure he can sense movement with his Kyonshi powers).

It only just occurred to me that Bulma buying a phone here mirrors a scene from canon during the same arc, where she just built one from a box of scraps. I must assume that she can't just do that here because the cel network in this version is comparable in security to real-world cel networks, whereas in 1986 it probably was sufficiently insecure that a random "I built the Dragon Radar" genius could pull that off.

I wonder if the Kaioken will come up in this story, seeing as the chips are already demonstrating similar abilities. I assume the Kaioken would be learning how to do it without artificial assistance, plus or minus a few details.

One thing that bothered me in canon about late-game uses of the Solar Flare / Taiyóken was how characters with well-developed alternatives to sight were still rendered useless by it (post-fusion Piccolo, complete with Kami's divine senses and Namekian hearing and ki-sense, was left grumbling for several seconds from a mere flash of light?). I like how you have Goku no-sell something similar, here, with the added foreshadowing that a carefully targeted ki-flash could serve a similar effect on ki-sensing. (Piccolo not using his Namekian hearing or antennae is still frustrating. This could have been a helpful stalling tactic against Freeza, where Krillin uses the Flare when Piccolo is in trouble, but Piccolo's probably-better senses make warning less necessary. Yeah, I recently heard that Freeza has super-hearing, but physiologically, shouldn't his hearing actually be worse than primates, based on ear-shape, and Namekians better? ... Why do Namekians have pointy ears, anyway? Are the predatory fangs and eyes just a Piccolo thing, in which case they can be blamed on his Mazoku background, or do we see other Namekians looking more predatory?).

Did Pilaf stop using the royal We at some point, and I forgot? I noticed it was missing in this chapter.

The Kaioken will indeed come up, though as you say, the HEP II chips already are very much just a technological version of the same technique.

I didn't remember that! But let's face it, genius or not, there's no way building one from scratch can be faster than just paying for one. And time is kind of the essence here.

It's a bit bothersome, yes, though you could argue that what it /actually/ happened was just a moment of confusion that's enough to be deciding in a hyper speed fight. After all, the anime dilates time... quite a bit.

I dropped it at some point given how his repeated humiliations and losses have necessarily downsized his ambitions a little. I made the relationship between him and Shu basically slide back to what it was before meeting Mai.
