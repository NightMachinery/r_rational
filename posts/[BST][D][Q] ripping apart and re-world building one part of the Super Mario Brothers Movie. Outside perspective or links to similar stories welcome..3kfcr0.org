I've had a bit of a light itch of an idea the past month or so.

This contains spoilers of the first twenty minutes/premise of a terrible movie.

That a dinosaur descendant 'princess' got left with a bunch of nuns in new york some time in the mid-late seventies and was 'hatched there'.

In the terrible movie the resulting child is indistinguishable from a human being and no one bothers to explore this.

But this got me thinking. What if we actually had something like a real dinosaur tool user of broad comparable ability to human intelligence and vocalization maybe around the size of the medium sized therapods (perhaps with an even better range).

Probably some downy feathers.

And that change to the premise kind of pushed out of the way a lot of the other stuff that happened with the movie and just turned into me musing on just how would any institution or family in new york deal with having an egg comparable to an ostrich hatch on their doorstep and produce an ugly beakless bird.

That naturally imprints on them and later grows up to mimic them socially, learn to speak and generally be a regular 'child' of her completely unknown species.

How would people deal with an animal that doesin't stay cute and 'stupid' but gets smart enough to both sass, ask difficult questions ponder about her own existence and figure out how to resolve any tool/technical challenges posed to it (or at least as good as a curious teenager-yound adult human).

How would the rest of the world deal with this thing?

Especially in the eighties and early nineties?


** Distinct but related hypothetical: how would we react to conclusive fossil/archaeological evidence that such a being existed about a hundred million years ago, and formed advanced civilization, before disappearing for unknown reasons?

*** personally I think finding an ancient civilization would make a lot of people go "neat" for a few years and then only a specialist group of geeks and scientists would be disturbed by it.

Mostly because it would give us some very disturbing implications regarding the great filter and fermi's paradox.

**** Yeah, that's pretty much why I find the concept of an intelligent dinosaur interesting.

My best current insight on Fermi's Paradox is that I think people overestimate the likelihood of a species intellectually capable of developing civilization actually developing it. I therefore suspect that the likelihood of "intelligent life" evolving is potentially higher than most people estimate, but there's an additional probability to consider, the probability of intelligent life using its intelligence to form a civilization, which is potentially very low.

I would be surprised, but not that surprised, to learn that at least one animal on the Earth today is intellectually capable of forming civilization but simply has not, and they are impeded by physiological differences - probably either octopi or dolphins, seeing as crows and non-human primates come into contact with humans regularly enough that you'd expect that humans would have rubbed off on them. I think it's worth putting a lot of research money into making absolutely certain that we can't establish a line of conlang-based communication with dolphins, and octopi, too, however crazy that sounds.

I would be legitimately very surprised if I learned humans were the first species in the Earth's history to be intellectually capable of developing civilization.

***** Well it's tricky to determine how 'smart' something is based on the fossil record.

And it's a bit cliche but eusociality has already been around for I think 100 million years.

Which bares striking resemblance to a civilization.

I think the wierd melange of political arms racing and tool refinement that humans have stumbled into is probably pretty rare.

But for the purpose of this discussion I am posing that it's happened at least once more on the same planet.

That said there is enough room in a technological arms racing civ 100-80 million years ago to completely surpass present capabilities and leave them looking like pondscum.

So that might be the best 'background' explanation for a dinosaur 'princess' egg showing up in new york as any.

** It depends on how it's presented to the public.

There's a /huge/ difference between "this animal can talk" and "this person looks like an animal". If it's the former, expect it to be treated more or less like an intelligent monkey until the point that it can talk, after which there would be considerable attention (and people might contextualize it as a weird human rather than a true reptile). If it's the latter ... there would be some stories, especially in the tabloids, but a human with an interesting deformity isn't necessarily national news, especially in an age where people are becoming more politically correct.

To some extent, it also depends on how much attention that dinosaur gives to the media. If it stays indoors, eventually the media will stop paying attention. If it goes out a lot, people are going to take note. If it decides to go on talk shows, it would probably be a national sensation, at least for a little bit (as fame is fleeting).

**** I suppose my first thought was to imagine how people react to others who are far outside the norm for humans. Like, [[http://mentalfloss.com/article/50078/true-stories-behind-11-famous-sideshow-performers][check this article]] about sideshow performers, notably Elephant Man and the Lion-Faced Man. If the from is close enough to human, people might just treat the princess like one of those people (which in the 80s and 90s probably /doesn't/ mean sticking her in a sideshow). You can plausibly explain away a whole host of "physical deformities" that just make her "look similar to" a dinosaur.

If the princess is more like a /Jurassic Park/ dinosaur but with feathers and human-level intelligence ... I think the outcome is more likely that you get an animal that's raised like an animal, resulting in a severe level of developmental retardation. Eventually, if it has the ability to speak and learns speech as a human does, that's where things get truly interesting.

***** The second is the concept I'm thinking of running with. Which brings me I guess to wondering just who in new york (for arbitrary source material nod and because I like the accent I'm thinking brooklyn) would satisfy the following criteria:

- Keep a ostrich sized egg for the few moments before it 'hatches' without freaking out entirely.

- Be willing to both keep and potentially compensate the needs of exotic weird bird for a few years?

I'm having trouble conceiving of just who would fullfill the second criteria, which is lending itself to me thinking that maybe our princess gets pawned off to some kind of 'expert' in exotic animals relatively early on but I dunno.

honestly on reflection I think it's more important to find some one that would hold onto the animal afterwards without it straining credibility rather then some one who could credibly get a mysterious egg.

Random doohickies can end up almost anywhere...

I was contemplating maybe the egg is actually found in an 'alcove' that was carved/buried in the bedrock of a skyscraper's foundation and some construction worker just nabbed it after the blasting revealed the egg (along with destroying several others presumably).

** If you're gonna rebuild it, I would suggest changing the "evolutionary lines" of some things. For example... Toads, Goombas, and Princess Toadstool? Not supposed to be dinosaurs. Fungus. Dinosaurs didn't evolve from fungus. A devolution gun shouldn't turn them back into dinosaurs because they never were one. And using the devolution gun on Koopas shouldn't turn them into fungus. Because they never were one.

But that's because evolution is sort of my pet thing and I grump when it's misportrayed.

** I caught the tail-end of a story on Radiolab about a chimp named Lucy that is relevant and interesting.

[[http://www.radiolab.org/story/91706-lucy/]]

Imagine a tweenager that can rip your arms off when she gets frustrated with you. and she has the intelligence and emotions of a toddler. Despite trying to raise her in a loving home environment, she grew too strong for her family to care for properly. They ended up locked her up at home and cycled through numerous animal handlers until they found one that would accompany her in a transition back to the wild (but just like how we'd be out of place in the wild, the semi-domesticated chimp also suffers from a severe adjustment disorder.) Ironically, the animal handler locked herself up in a cage while she helped the chimps transition to the wild.
