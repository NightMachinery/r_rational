Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** There has been one fic that I literally couldn't put down because of how entertaining and

cool it was. It's like a comedic /Metropolitan Man./ It was so realistic and rational that I could actually see it taking place in real life.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/batman-1939-the-dangers-of-being-cold.376659/][The Dangers of Being Cold]]

/December, 1940. Bodies are disappearing from morgues. A couple lies murdered in the street. To solve the mystery, Batman must seek the help of the most frustrating thief he's ever crossed. But the conspiracy behind it may still be too powerful. Chased on the coldest night of the year, has the Dark Knight found a foe so above the law even he cannot deliver the offender to justice?/

This novel is like a professional level story and explores how Batman could use his tools in real life. Here we see Batman solve puzzles and problems from logical deductions that the reader could figure out.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/batman-1939-swimming-in-the-styx.379010/][Swimming in the Styx]]

/August, 1941. In Gotham City they say the Four Families are untouchable, and no one is more dangerous than Batman. Both these myths are shattered in one night. The first by the Dark Knight himself. The second by a myth far older than Gotham's little tales, a myth that's fearsome and unrelenting and wondrous./

The sequel ups the ante on everything. The introduction of magic, wonder woman, nazis, the mafia and so on. Just creates this detective noir fiction that almost acts like it takes place in the same setting as Metropolitan Man. I would also rate this novel at a professional novel.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/batman-1939-a-very-special-batman-christmas.472177/][A Very Special Batman Christmas]]

/It takes place on Christmas Eve of 1941. It follows Bruce's efforts to stop the mysterious Yuletide Thief and attend a Christmas Eve gathering with Julie Madison./

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/batman-1939-threes-company.841520/][Three's Company]]

The fourth book in this series that is ongoing as of right now.

/October, 1941. Some secrets are best left hidden. When Zatanna Zatara, the Mistress of Magic, and Selina Kyle, the greatest cat burglar alive, both find themselves tangled in mysteries they can't charm or steal, they turn to the World's Greatest Detective. Can Batman help both ladies without playing the rope in their personal tug-of-war? Stay tuned./

​

This author isn't getting enough love for how much effort he's put in to his works and all the details and characterizations the characters have in the story. Even Gotham gets a characterization. Just make sure to not have anything important to do because the story is hard to put down. Thanks for reading!

P.S. Does anyone know of any Justice League Fics in the same vein or that are decent to read? I don't really mind if they're rational or not.

Not a fic, but I'm having a ridiculous blast these days with the new Harley Quinn animated show. The Justice League features occasionally, of course, though the main focus is villains. It's a pretty adult and dark humour-esque take on the DC universe, with Harley Quinn breaking free from the Joker and deciding to try and make it big on her own. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aogsZ71ECb0][Here is the clip that single handedly sold me on the show]]. It's like someone went to DC and asked for money to animate their parody crackfic and the execs shrugged and went "sure, why not?".

** I'd like to recommend a great story from royal road that is not a litrpg and that never got popular. I might in fact be the only person who read it, which is a shame because it's pretty hilarious.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29027/a-city-stranded-cowboys-robot-mercy-killing-business]]

A group of weirdos find a high tech device in a dumpster that can detect suffering. With it they discover that many people use computers to create simulations to torture the inhabits of these fake worlds. So, the group assassinates the sick overlords and offer the virtual inhabitants destruction or a few eons of torture free simulated life.

That's just the set up, though. The topics and plot are all over the place. It's very clever, but is far too quirky for rr or other sites except perhaps this subreddit.

I wrote a fuller review on rr at the link. Check it out...

I'd classify it as almost absurdism, but with some amount of logic throughout it. Though I do kinda wish people would argue with Junji more. He tends to make assertions/suggestions about a topic, then everyone (often Tex) who tries arguing against that just kinda fails at putting together an argument.

**** Just saw it on the slush pile of recent posts back when it was updating. The weird title made me check it out.

Yeah. There are a few super rational characters and moral/ethical topics. And I find the dialog is amusing.

#+begin_quote
  "...been teacher's assisting a Biopsychology course since I know a lot about the subject." the taller man finished to Junji.

  "I enjoyed Biopsychology." Junji replied.

  "Uhuh. Did you know that when you have an emotion, you're only having that emotion because of the chemicals in your brain?"

  "Yes, that is what emotions are."

  The man nodded.

  "That means that when humans help each other, it's just cause of the chemicals they get that make them feel good for doing it." he continued.

  "Mhm. I find it quite optimistic."

  The man's face twisted with confusion.

  "What?" he asked.

  "I said I found it quite optimistic. I would find it pessimistic if humans inherently valued sabotaging each other. Because they do not value this, I feel the opposite."

  "...We're all just machines, man. That's supposed to bother you."

  "I love machines. I consider it an honor to be one."

  After shooting Junji a look of disbelief, the taller man turned and left with a scoff.

** So, there's an anime called Horimiya airing this season. It's slice-of-life/feel-good romcom, and looks much the way all the rest of that genre looks at first glance. I would not be mentioning it, except...

...the characters, though not necessarily particularly rational, /actually communicate/. It's not lampshaded or even particularly in your face - the show is something of a slow burner - but it brings into sharp relief how few such stories there are in this genre, in this medium. Over and over I keep expecting the cliched thing to happen, and... it doesn't.

I wasn't going to mention it even so, except that last week a particular character's communication issues were revealed and became a plot point... and are on track to be dealt with, following actually sensible reactions instead of the denseness we have all come to expect. I may yet be proven wrong on this matter - we'll find out this week - but at this point I'm betting on the show to resolve this somewhat maturely. I was all ready to declare Wonder Egg Priorty show of the season, but this might, in its understated manner, quietly pip it. Will update if I turn out to be wrong, watch this space :)

*** I would add to this that there is another anime this season called Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki-kun which has probably turned off a lot of people with its cringe-sounding premise but actually is a lot smarter and more interesting than that.

The premise is that Tomozaki-kun, an introvert with social anxiety problems but extremely skilled at gaming (specifically, at the in-universe off brand version of Smash Bros) meets up with a long time rival who, he finds out, is a girl from his class - and is absolutely /not impressed/ with him being such a slob. He explains that he refuses to try any harder than this in life because he feels like it's random, unfair and inconsistent - like a bad game - but she replies that it's just sour grapes, and proposes to teach him about "the game of life".

What follows is actually an interesting examination of group and communication dynamics and how social interaction /works/ - as Tomozaki basically trains in the art of not being a total loner. There's a lot more to it as his training skirts the boundary between fair and manipulative, sometimes, and this is subtly acknowledged and dealt with, as well as the motives and mindset of his teacher, Aoi, being themselves perhaps not entirely healthy either. But yeah, in general, it's a pretty unusual take on the idea that social interaction isn't just about "being yourself" if you are the kind of person to whom such things don't come natural, and also an examination of the various sorts of roles and issues that people who are apparently sociable might actually experience when part of a group.

He makes a bunch of money by introducing distillation and double-entry book keeping and then does a bunch of politics and generally attempts to stave off the dark ages.

It's been a while since I read it, but I remember liking it at the time. IIRC it has reasonably intelligent and rational though otherwise somewhat 2D characters, and the plot was interesting enough, but is mostly the sort of story you get when someone has a neat idea and wants to explore the implications, but it does that fairly well and is short enough that that doesn't start to drag.

- *Nobunaga no Chef* - A chef finds himself in 16th century Japan and ends up working for Oda Nobunaga, using modern cooking to help advance Nobunaga.

- *Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan: Noukou Giga* - Also set in 16th century Japan and the MC working for Oda Nobunaga, though this this time the MC is a teenage schoolgirl who specializes in agriculture (though the does bring a few novel ideas from the future for other aspects of life).

Based off of history:

- *Youjo Senki* - A middle-aged HR company man gets isekaied to the equivalent of early 20th century Europe in the body of a young girl. He finds himself on the frontlines of their world war (which is basically WW1 but it happens a bit later and uses magic). It's an alternate world, but it kinda follows the same history as Earth

Future knowledge, no history:

- *Isekai Tensei Soudouki* - Not really time travel since it's an alternate world, but it's set in the past and the MC uses his knowledge from being raised in modern times to advance his fiefdom economically and scientifically.

- *Shadow Queen* - The MC is adopted and raised as a sacrifice/puppet killed in a plot to replace her with another woman. She reawakens before the events take place and has to pretend to be the same passive girl while scheming and undermining her adoptive family.

- *Ernak* - A gamer finds himself in a game several years in the past. He uses his knowledge to change the storyline to survive in an upcoming war.

*Cross Time Engineer - by Leo Frankowski.*

1990s mechanical engineer is accidentally sent back in time to 1220s, about two decades before the Mongol Invasion on Europe.

He decides to put all his knowledge to work o industrialising Medieval Poland, Hungary and Moravia to fighting strength before the Mongols kill everyone in the eastern half of the continent.

It mostly depict the attitudes and mores of 1200s correctly (showing how alien their ways of thinking would be to ours, combining extreme conservatism in some aspects with astonishing liberalism in others).

The hero, who not strictly rational, is by heart an engineer, trying to solve all problems as if they were technical issues (which sometimes fail spectacularily).

The books tend to be a bit "red pilled" at times, strongly masculine (sex, violence and badassery by the truckload), and relentlessly techno-positivist ("I can save them all, we just need MORE TECHNOLOGY!").

** People here might like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-N0kaRIWo4][Solar Opposites]](<-episode 1 link) by the other creator of Rick and Morty, i.e. not Dan Harmon, of Community fame. You might have heard of him as the one who made such hilariously tasteless and stupid parodies of Back to the Future(fixing time paradoxes via ball licking) and Bill Cosby(undescribable, just [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUBnrIaphQ][watch it yourself]]).

Anyway, the main premise is scifi-y take on a typical sitcom nuclear family, only instead of a husband and wife and it's two genderless-but-male-affecting aliens and their 2 younger clones(literal clones), one affecting as male the other as female, and they escaped their homeworld just as it was destroyed or something and crashlanded on earth.

If I had to describe the show after the first 2 episodes, I'd say it's like Rick and Morty, but 50% more adult swim-y(in a bad way). What do I mean by that? There's a scene in episode 2 where the two kid aliens, minor spoilers: cut open a teenage girl's cranium and pour soda on her exposed brain so they wouldn't get in trouble at school. Yes, 2 kids lobotimize a 3rd.

I almost dropped it at that point, but I'm glad I didn't because [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LakRwuCafEg][episode 3]] is exactly when the show stops pretending to be a procedural scifi riff on your typical nuclear family sitcom and starts to become the sort of weird, off the wall shit that I wish all animated shows aspired to. The kind of thing that would be impossible to do in a live action show, on network television(or even cable), and/or if they didn't already have a guaranteed 2nd season.

** Any Boku No Hero Academia related recommendations? I'm kinda in a BNHA mood lately. The reason why is that consistently the biggest draw to me in media is novelty, or people exploring uncommon or inventive concepts, motivations, or abilities. Modern/indie superhero-centric and sometimes magic-centric stories do this quite a bit, as does a lot of fiction that ends up on this subreddit. (I also go back to playing Path of Exile every few months just to make characters centred around dumb interactions, which should serve as both a recommendation and another way of understanding my tastes. I still miss when they accidentally made a skill's number of hits scale exponentially with reduced move speed and it was incredibly dumb and hilarious and barely playable all at once). Any other recs that fit that motivation are certainly welcome, fic or not.

I'm on mobile right now and pretty checked out for the night, so I'll edit this post and go through a bunch of BNHA stuff I've read that had something stand out about it tomorrow. For now I'll point out that Daymare does a reasonable job of being an engaging story, although the talent the author has for descriptions is brilliant, and gets put to work given the central difference to the story is the Midoriya has a quirk that feels like something meshed together from 3 parts Zerg and 1 part Lovecraft.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11277075?view_full_work=true]]

(oh also sort of rec for the manga Chainsaw man for doing the above stuff with inventive worldbuilding and also being able to wrap up its story with a ending that encapsulated the story perfectly and tied everything together, although the narrative feels pretty JoJo-esque so not exactly this subreddit's preference in many a case. ...also good if you like hot characters in suits.)

Edit: Here's the stuff I've read. Memory's not perfect for these, and there's enough common themes among BNHA fic some of it is going to be blurred together in my mind. Semi-sorted by trope.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13661763/chapters/31380618][Looking Glass]]: ~5 year old Midoriya goes missing. Turns out he was specifically kidnapped by the League of Villains since they knew (for Reasons) that he was coming into a quirk that basically gave him the deductive capabilities that tv shows try to write for "generic genius *totally not autistic* detective" from shows like Sherlock, etc. Don't mistake my disdain for shitty tv shows as disdain for this fic, since its overall a fairly reasonable fic, if a bit grimmer than standard fair. Plot basically starts at the USJ attack where Midoriya runs into All Might by chance, gets arrested, and once it comes out that he was kidnapped and tortured for years the heroes decide that carting him off to jail when he is: A) a child B) a very useful source of information C) already heavily traumatised D) resistant to legal interrogation techniques E) more or less trying to be a decent person, all combine to make them decide to hide him in UA instead. Story is "finished" in that there's a satisfying climax and all, but the last update was 3 months ago and there's supposed to be an Epilogue so the story ends on something more fulfilling than "fight over, time to pass the fuck out." idk if a "book 2" will end up being written later as well since there's still plenty of canon left to work with.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11277075/chapters/25222215][Daymare]]: Same description I said above. 330k words, last updated end of January. Arguably the best written one, but that statement is largely on the basis of its use of descriptions and language, so its not necessarily the best recommendation for the people reading this post in this particular subreddit. Honorable mention to non-canon antagonist Mincemeat, who is basically "what if Setsuna's quirk (canon student from 1B) got turned up to 11 and mixed with a horror movie serial killer antagonist."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13933635/chapters/32073363][From Muddy Waters]]: Midoriya is All For Ones kid, but still wants to be a hero. It's an uphill battle when he and his mum and in hiding from his dad and All Might and co. recognise Midoriya's origin and are varying degrees of scared shitless. Actually read this a while back so my memory's a bit fuzzier, but I read it all, enjoyed it, and ended up waiting for a further update that hasn't come. 160k words, last updated mid last year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1151561][Deku Sees Dead People]]: Midoriya basically has the kid from The Sixth Sense's shtick. Spends his childhood hiding it since explicit confirmation of post-death existence is apparently a step too far in a world with superpowers. It's a reasonably interesting approach overall, although I don't think it gets the exploration any talk of "immortality" that the typical denizen of this subreddit wants, so your mileage may vary. >420k words and ends at a reasonable point, although the author started writing further short stories in the setting afterwards that might have original been building up to a "book 2" type of thing after the pseudo-interludes before petering out. I haven't read any of the extra ~40k words tho so idk for certain.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7392847/chapters/16792135][But You Gotta Get Up At Least Once More]]: Story started from the idea "what if Midoriya had Saitama's powerset (One Punch Man)" and ended up being the fic on this list that goes the deepest into emotions and trauma instead, despite having arguably the strongest power involved. Ignore the "6 chapters" detail, its 100k words long. Unfinished, last updated mid 2017.

Quirkless + Intelligent Midoriya fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11088315/chapters/24735288][Erased Potential]]: Midoriya looks for inspiration in other places. Finds out about Eraserhead, realises all the fighting he does is basically quirkless (besides dragging the other guy down to his level more or less, unless they've got a mutated/permanent body quirk that can't be cancelled), so he tracks down someone who doesn't want to be found and ends up getting impressing him enough to get trained by him. 180k words, last updated half a year ago, I don't know if it's coming back.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1633756][For Want of a Nail Collection]]: 4 fics by the same author where the common thread is that All Might completely fucks up his first conversation with Midoriya in different ways. I've only read the first two so far, where Midoriya focuses on information support instead of directly fighting people in both. The first one is where he ends up getting in touch with a bunch of underground heroes anonymously online, helps them out, and gains a reputation that way before ending up getting recommended to UA. Second one is where he gets anonymously gets in touch with a random villain online, points out some hero vulnerabilities and complementary strategies, and builds a reputation through that instead. Basically ending up an independent contractor for planning things for villains. Both fics I've read bring up discrimination against quirkless people. First is 140k words, second is nearing 100k (there's a part 2 underway). They're not bad fics, but arguably the weakest on this list (although there's one critical point in the second fic which is just really dumb and contrived). Still updating.

I read Worm a while back. Its hard to say whether I enjoyed the story, even if many aspects of the world and characters were great. The fact that every arc felt like you could describe it with the phrase "and then everything got worse" across the entire story was persistently depressing and made it a slog to read at times. Not dissing the author or the story as an absolute, just meaning that I personally had an issue with reading through that. I did finish it though, even if I had to stop a few times, but I don't know if I'll really bother with any of Wildbows other work, given I've heard a lot of mixed feelings on Ward and I tried reading Pale but couldn't get into it. I might just end up scrolling through the wikis for his works sometime out of curiosity instead, since I can't fault Wildbow's creativity.

Yeah I was looking into doing builds like that this PoE league, spent way too long in PoB seeing what I could do. Actually ended up playing a build with CwC Cyclone + Summon Skeles + Heartbound Loops, wearing a Fleshcrafter to instantly kill my Skeles, and a full CwDT Blade Blast + utility Blade skills set up with dualwielding Razor of the Seventh Sun as an Ignite Chieftain. It was surprisingly effective (especially compared to some of the things I play) and you had to keep paying attention, since Cycloning an empty screen would have you quickly kill yourself. I ended up quitting the league early, since I moved house basically the same time the league launched, and it took me over a month to actually start sleeping a passable amount again, so I quickly got too tired for my brain to handle PoE through the fog in my head.

It's pretty good past that point; the author realized that what was basically a sidequest was getting a lot more intense than intended, and went back and retconned a couple of things so that it could all be wrapped up in another chapter after the giant ghost thing.

The part immediately afterwards is a lot of social fighting with Nezu, who's convinced there's something wrong with Reiko (which there is)

The author is both faithfully transcribing whatever the tone that Homer was going for, the weighty, epic mythos around the story, but also skillfully jabbing fun at it.

*** I really do love Dungeon Crawler Carl, it does some fantastic things. There's a lot of really clever munchkinning with the various loot and Carl is smart and competent with his plans and actions, and I love how he abuses all the mechanics such as infinite storage to its very limits. And on top of that, I really enjoy the humor and setting, all mixed together in a frankly horrifying situation where humanity is effectively dead and made a mockery of by the rest of the universe. I don't typically enjoy it when novels have over the top humor or revolve entirely around it, but I absolutely adore how DCC does it and how it plays into the messed up setting. Carl blowing up a Goblin boss and his boss room full of babies, Donut's crappy lookalike toy that also has influences of Garfield, but instead of normal Garfield, it's all I'mSorryJon material, Mantaurs and all the other whacky monsters, and so on. DCC is a surprisingly good novel that makes the most of it's setting, style, and humor.

I don't know if you'll enjoy this as it's quite divisive apparently, but perhaps you'll enjoy the Japanese Light Novel series "So I'm a Spider, So What?"

It follows a female MC isekai'd into a spider monster, the weakest class of monster, in the largest labyrinth in the world. The litrpg is surprisingly well-done for the medium, even if it isn't anything spectacular like Delve, but is is incredibly tight and without plotholes and even plays into the overarching plot. I will warn that there's quite a large genre shift in the series, but many tend to agree that's where the story becomes even better. It's pretty similar to both DCC and Shade Touched in that the System and world is pretty messed up and that the MC is a non-human MC that just wants to live. The MC's personality is energetic and hilarious, similar to Shadow, if a lot less...wholesome, and a lot more violent.

It's an interesting take on the litrpg and isekai genres that very few other series pull off, at least to me personally. The volumes can be a tad expensive at around 8 dollars a volume if you obtain them through legitimate sources, so price can be a concern for jumping into an unknown series.

**** I'm in full agreement about every single one of your points about DCC, to the point where I could have written your first paragraph myself and then forgotten about it. It's a little scary.

I really think DCC is a good fit for this sub precisely because of the clever munchkinry and how the MCs win through competent planning. Outcomes make sense and are never chosen for plot reasons. Even when there's some degree of Deus Ex, like when Carl sees something shine and picks up the container for the Doomsday Scenario, it's justified in-universe as the game giving players a chance to succeed. And yep, it's rare that authors pull off the whole humor thing. It usually falls flat for me.

I've never given light novels a chance, but maybe it's time. Thank you for the detailed response!

***** The first book is weak, and the story changes quite dramatically after for the better.

I've always compared TZKS to Hunter x Hunter, and the openings are one similarity. HxH is a decent but unremarkable shonen to begin with, until the arrival of Nen and the York Shin arc. Similarly, TZKS is just a variation on a super hero story until they defeat the first bad guy (Damien?) and the arrival of the Vanguard and Abolish to the story. Both get a lot more interesting as powers open up and the world gets expanded.

**** I'm going to de-rec Heretical Edge.

It is long, but it's also /so repetitive/. Half of it is essentially family drama combined with high school teen drama just replayed over and over again between additional characters. It feels like essentially every other chapter is revealing all of the DEEP IMPORTANT SECRETS to a new person, concluding with a "we have a lot to talk about" as long lost relatives feel the need to catch up with each other.

It has the potential to be really cool but it needs about half the characters to be cut out and then a bunch of other stuff to be cut out as well. I got to chapter 17-06 before I finally gave up because I realized I was skimming most of each chapter because it was just boring reading the exact same emotional and story beats over and over again.

Not to mention the fact that, it got to the point where it seemed like practically every single character, bar 1 or 2 was actually secretly on team "strangers aren't all bad", but no one knew that about everyone else, so I was really confused at how they had not already won, and with the number of people that have been inducted into the secret, it became increasingly improbably that whatever powers in charge that /weren't/ on aboard wouldn't find out without extreme levels of incompetence.

***** Heretical Edge starts out as an urban fantasy magical high school story but later evolves into more of a magical civil war / revolution setting. The basic premise is that certain humans can see all the Strangers and Monsters that normal people can't see (vampires, werewolves, chimera, dire wolves, slenderman-types etc.) and then they go to magical school to become "Heretics" who gain the ability to absorb abilities from killing Strangers. For example, if a Heretic kills a werewolf, they might suddenly be able to smell better or have more stamina or if a Heretic kills a ghost, they might gain the ability to possess people.

Summus Proelium is an original superhero story + setting which involves the protagonist (who wants to be a hero) finding out that her family are all hardcore villains. Has many parallels to /Worm/, probably because the author started out writing Worm-fanfiction, but it's more fun in general and the protagonist's existence isn't an endless parade of suffering.

****** I just finished chapter two, it's kind of annoying that the story begins with an already grown and educated Jen, the story doesn't seem to attempt to be rational/ist, and at least at the beginning he seems way less experienced as an author, but he made some interesting changes to how magic works compared to canon and the grammar is fine so I'll continue reading it, I think I'll edit this comment every time I finish one of the books(there's four).

Update B1Ch7: up until this point, it's a mixed bag of interesting subversion of fanon tropes, brief looks at what seems like an interesting magic system, somewhat reasonable bashing of details of the canon novels, and characters occasionally holding the idiot ball during social interactions. and the mc seems slightly op.

Update B1C13: more of the same, maybe a bit less of the social idiot ball. though, I'm getting tired of Jen's magic being different just because. 6/10 until now, it's readable.

Update B1C21: still readable and fun, certainly less idiot ball but not rational, Mc very op. Sorry, writing on phone.

Last Update of book 1: I'm on chapter 29/35 but I don't expect my opinion on the subject to change anymore, everything I said before stands up until now. Jen is op by the standards of her age group, it seems like she would be a match for a powerful Auror or pro-duelist, but it's implied that people like dumbledore match her in power and surpass her in experience. it's a popcorn read, it just manages to cross from decent/readable to good (by my standards, and I'll read almost anything if I'm bored), the author was clearly less experienced at this point because Spells in Silence seems to be better written in almost all aspects to the point that I would change my original rating from 7/10 to 7.5/10. coming back to Princess, I would give it a 6.5/10.

my plans now are to finish reading the whole Princess series and then read the Pureblood Pretense. I doubt I'll finish reading the rest of the series before the next weekly thread so I doubt I'll update this comment anymore.

Edit: Ah yeah it was the Deku Sees Dead People one.

Parks and Recreation is also pretty good, though in a different way, less laughs-per-minute and more of a parasocial, hanging out kinda vibe. The generally accepted advice is to start with the second season as the first is rough.

If you like Rick and Morty (or even if you don't) you might like Solar opposites, recommended in-depth [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lpq207/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gof35s7/][here]] by yours truly.

I'll second the rec for Bojack Horseman. It's probably the best character study ever done in a half hour comedy. Lots of laughs, lots of feels.

Another show in the same vein as Bojack(laugs+feels) is Louie. This one was a critical darling until Louis CK's fall from grace, whereupon both it and it's creator completely dropped off the radar. Definitely worth a look.

There's [[https://web.archive.org/web/20070120052330/http://www.grrlgamer.com/review.php?g=animamundi][Animamundi: Dark Alchemist]] though the protagonist is bisexual (or just doesn't care much?).

I only finished one route but frankly the purple-haired guy's ending was sublime. Strongly recommend using a guide, the system is incomprehensible.

Or /Togainu no Chi/ (translates to /Blood of the Reprimanded Dog/). Akira, street fighter, is offered freedom from his prison sentence to take part in a slightly bizarre lawless combat game inside a city ruled entirely by a druglord. I never finished reading this one (also, I can't recommend the anime, it loses the thread early), but what I did read was surprisingly good. Motomi was an especially interesting character. Fair warning, its made by a Nitroplus BL division, which means excessive gore. Edit: and explicit sex, if that wasn't obvious.

Also, he wasn't the protagonist (though he might as well have been, he's practically the main character), but I think that Kogami in /Psycho-Pass/ was hinted to be a homosexual. (As an irrelevant aside, Nitroplus founder Urobuchi Gen was highly invovled in this show.)

** There's a movie called Drishyam 2 that came out this week. It's not in English, and you should watch the first one too, but I think other people on this sub would really like both movies.

The first one revolves around a man whose daughter murders a boy threatening to rape her and her mother, and who tries to cover it up and evade arrest. It's decently intelligent by film standards (I'm thinking of Death Note's style being only slightly better), but while I liked it, I didn't love it. I did love the new sequel though. The ending is a tad expository and the first half slightly bloated, but that's borderline nitpicking. If you like dramas with plotting, gambits, and fairly decent planning, you'll probably like this. It's on Amazon Prime in most countries, I think.

*** Honestly didn't expect a rec for a Malayalam movie here. Drishyam and Drishyam 2 were both pretty nice, but the second movie does suffer a bit due to the pandemic conditions as it had to be rushed.

I'd second the recs. Check em out if you are okay with a foreign language movie. And make sure that you watch the Malayalam version with Mohan Lal as the protag; there are remakes for the first one in many languages but not for the sequel (it's too new).

** Plenty of warning signs on this fic -- written in present tense, started with a harem tag (removed in response to reader feedback), MC earns a Darwin award before it even starts... But it also has munchkinry and science. Follows a primitive tech progression (pottery, charcoal, iron working, etc) and talks about the stoichiometric composition of raw materials, so I'm curious where it will go. Goofy in tone rather than dark like a lot of dungeon core stories. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40265/dungeon-io-crafting][Dungeon I/O (⚒ Crafting ⚒)]]

***** I don't have an infinite amount of time to try new things, so I tend to use simple heuristics to both give or not give things a chance. An author that uses emojis liberally like that is something that I would model as less likely to produce fiction that matches my tastes.

Additionally, I'm confident that if it actually is any good, it will pop up again here or elsewhere, whereupon I'll reevaluate.

** Shooting a rec for: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40051/isekai-mother]]

Its a fairly rational rationalist isekai. The start gives a bit of a "this magic system makes the MC op because she is genius but I handwave how exactly cos CBF fleshing it out" but later chapters are worth it and are very satisfying.

Also for those who care about diversity the MC is Muslim. For those who don't it doesn't really have any bearing on the plot other than backstory anyway.

*** For cases like this, I'd like to write a script that generates different versions of the same story, but with the blanks filled in with different DIE groups. That way, if your social commissar says you need to read more stories about black women, you can pick that in the script and it'll insert the appropriate paragraph in the first chapter, along with filling in the name, and occasional references to clothing and skin tone.

All movies, though 'Stand By Me' is adapted from a classic short story and 'It' is a novel, both Steven King, and 'Neverending Story' is a series of novels originally in german, iirc. The first 'It' movie has probably the best child actor performances I've seen in a long time, particularly Sophia Lillis, which goes on to do the netflix show *'I Am Not Okay With This'*(highly recommended).

*** I can recommend DARK - the Netflix show, that is. Though it only /starts/ with Stranger Things vibe, and gets wildly different as the story goes on. Really good show tho, and although I wouldn't really call it rational or anything, the characters aren't stupid. There were no "Thorin turns back after getting a little too early" moments that I recall. I recommend going in on the show blind, and committing to watch at least the first 3 episodes.
