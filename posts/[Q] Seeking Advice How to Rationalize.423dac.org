When trying to rationalize (make a rational fanfic out of) someone else's work, how does one decide which bits of a setting or plot get changed, which bits get retconned, which bits get kept as-is, and which bits get discarded entirely?


** You ought to keep the world recognizable. How much you can still change and still have that be the case really depends on what your fictional universe looks like and will vary from fandom to fandom. If I'm writing a Where's Waldo fanfic, and I decide that it's stupid that Waldo always wears red and white, then I also start changing his (canonically very thin) personality, eventually I'm just left with a guy wandering between worlds who might as well not be Waldo. You /can/ do this sort of total character replacement, but then that means you have to ground your fic to the fictional world in some other way.

You ought to keep the things that are cool. Making a fantastical world mundane is easy, but usually not that satisfying. You can take /Star Wars/ and say that lightsabers are impractical or the Death Star is a dumb idea that should never have been made, but if you take those things out you're removing something cool. If you do that, you had better have something to replace it with. Most of the time, it's better to leave the cool stuff around.

With those two things in mind, I usually keep to canon as much as possible, mostly because it keeps the new world grounded in the fictional world. It's almost always better to justify things somehow than to just strip them out entirely. As a bonus, most fandoms will have already done the hard work for you in the form of fanwank. The only place where you really need to worry is when there's something that throws the whole story on its head, something wildly inconsistent, or when you want to explore some aspect that fanwank is trying to patch over.

The first of these I think is the most common major issues. In my story's canon universe, Pokeballs are so arbitrarily powerful that the temptation to include more features and failsafes and capabilities than those included in the games/anime, like wireless data backup and automatic registry, have to be resisted. Since I need to draw the line of how powerful they are somewhere, I'm trying to stick to the games' capabilities as much as possible, and even come up with various miscellaneous restrictions (battery life, mass limits, "lock on" requirement) to explain why people in the games and anime don't, for example, fly over wild pokemon dropping pokeballs on them until they're caught.

Otherwise, taken at face value with how they seem to work in canon, the munchkinry would be so powerful and so obvious that the only explanation for why people in the games and anime don't use them that way and are still smart enough to tie their shoelaces in the morning is that pokeballs can't be used that way, and it's just up to our imagination, or in this case mine, to come up with restrictions why they don't. To try to balance that out, I also added some power to them in the form of once the pokemon is inside, it's caught, period: there's nothing sentient left inside it to "fight" its way out, so it's a more rational take on the issue in any case.

** So you've decided that your favorite piece of multimedia needs its own rational fanfic, and you're just the person to do it. It's chock full of opportunities to poke fun at the source material, and has the potential to be even more awesomely epic if you can just smooth a few of the rough edges.

To do that smoothing, I've noticed a few different techniques being used:

1) The Self-Insert. Create a new character or convert an existing one to be Dangerously Genre Savvy, while leaving all other aspects of the source work intact. The new/converted character will happily point out all of the absurdities of the setting while finding the easy solutions to season-long story arcs.

2) The Single Point of Departure. Take the canon backstory, with one or two small changes (optional), and then let the butterflies do their thing... even if it means that the "current events" are completely different from the source material. The source material ceases to be a useful reference for guessing what happens next, what happened five minutes ago... It's all up in the air.

3) The Repaired Backstory. (I can't think of a better title for this one) In this scenario, the starting conditions of a story are altered in such a way that the "current events" of the source material happen for good reasons rather than because plot dictated they should. As the story progresses, things can veer off course again. Unless the "current event" that the plot was repaired towards turns out to be the ending.

4) For Want of a Shark Tank. You know how your favorite story was going great until the author(s) decided to make something really stupid happen because The Plot Demanded It? In this case, you simply ignore it. Pretend it never happened. Just ignore the source material entirely and do your own thing because the source material just can't be fixed.

I will refer you now to our* holy scripture and guiding light: HPMOR. It contained a mix of all these things. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres is unquestionably a Type 1 fanfic device. While there are multiple points of departure, Type 2 follows from the altered intelligence of certain characters, and the prophecies followed by others. Yet, at the same time, these alterations were made in such a way that the canon starting point was intact, making it simultaneously Type 3. The story of the boy-who-lived is identical to canon, despite the altered facts, and all characters are in their proper starting positions. The cracks in the timeline don't become noticeable until after the first Defense class. And finally, there are some parts of the story (Goblet of Fire, anyone?) that are just discarded entirely, with maybe a lampshade or two hung up as a Take That.**

So when you're trying to reconcile all the various non-sensical parts of your favorite story, how do you decide between the tools available to you?

-* I say "our" despite this being my first post in this subreddit.

-** Why, yes, I have wasted a significant fraction of my life reading TV Tropes. How did you know?

*** I'd add a 5th category, the future problem fixer: In this type you leave all cannon as is and no events that take place in the story change, however you write about what would actually occur in the world after the events of the story( for example in the fic I'm working on that takes place in the Harry Potter universe the slytherins don't just move on with their lives after being locked in a dungeon while their parents are either killed or locked in Azkaban. )

*** I'm curious, given your title, if you have something you're working on rationalizing or are you just looking to refine this answer to your question in a sort of providing a framework sense if someone googles this issue later?

**** Both, actually. Twenty years ago, one of my first writing projects was a novelization of Final Fantasy 6. I stalled on the project about a quarter of the way through because while trying to fill in the internal monologues and third-person limited omniscient details, I noticed how many plot holes there were. But the desire never completely died away, and though I've written other things since then, it's been festering in the back of my mind this whole time.

I was going to ask here about things specific to Final Fantasy 6, but halfway through typing my initial post, I realized that:

1) I want to do the actual work of rationalizing it, as much as possible, and compiling crowd-sourced solutions wouldn't be all that rewarding.

2) I want advice slightly more specific to fanfiction than the short-answers on "How to Write Intelligent Characters". Something a bit more practical, but still not specific enough to violate Desire 1 above. And if I want it, others probably do as well. And if I tried to give my own example, it would run the risk of derailing the thread and accomplish neither goal.

I realize that the kind of advice I'm seeking will most likely fall under the category of "things you can only learn by repetition and repeated failure." I could figure it out for myself with enough work. However, I'm lazy, and if there's a chance I can skip some of the hard work by asking the internet for advice, I'll try it.

***** Well in that case, my general case suggestion would be utterly unhelpful to your specific project, but here it is anyway in case its useful to someone else or helps you in spite of my expectation:

Don't plan ahead TOO far at first, and don't get too attached to any one plotline idea. In the case of fanfiction where you're changing a character or premise in cases 1, 2, or 4, remember that the butterfly effect is a thing.

To continue your HPMOR example, if I were going to write a fanfiction rationalizing the HP world (I actually am, but it's from the point of view of a self insert that got eaten by the Diary Horcrux and so thinks of himself as a 16 year old tom riddle. He finds having some of the memories of 'a time travelling muggle that read Harry Potter's Memoirs' to be confusing... but I digress) But anyway, I would try writing it as a series of "What does X do in situation Y? What situation Z does that produce?" repeat for each character and then start again to handle the newly minted situation Zs. Do that until story reaches the end. Sometimes you'll find that if you can get your characters to feel like people... they really almost write the story for you by themselves.

I would also try to sort the stations of canon out into things that happened for local reasons that your changes will impact and things that happened for reasons outside of the area. As an example: My one altered character, and his butterflies, will not likely derail the Year 4 tournament that most likely involved a lot of international politics over a few years to make happen. OTOH, if my character interacts with Dumbledore a lot, the SPECIFIC tasks might get changed if I cause him to miss a meeting where he was involved in the decisions.

If you're trying to follow the plotline of a video game start to finish I don't know if that helps.

*** And I'd add a 6th category: Point of Divergence, which is similar to Type 2, where you pick a single point (non-backstory; mid-stream) where you think the canon story went off the rational rails, and pick up telling the tale from that point on, but taking a rational path instead. Bonus points if that's the only arbitrary change you make to canon, and unless a further change follows logically from the initial point of divergence, canon holds.

** Two things to keep in mind:

-you know how you sat down for a few hours, thinking of ways to fix a character's situation? You have to assume that every rational person has done that for years on end with only their own interests in mind. Any solutions you devise have already been brought up, discussed, discarded or well underway by the time the story starts. There's no such thing as a blank slate character.

-what makes characters interesting is their flaws, their dishonest intents, their choice of wrong decisions for personal reasons. Too often, rational makeovers crush every trait of suboptimal personality out of the main characted, turning them into blank-faced problem solving machines. Don't fall into that trap.
