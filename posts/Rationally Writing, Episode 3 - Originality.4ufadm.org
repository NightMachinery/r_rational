** Originality is an interesting topic. A common motivation for writers is the desire to share thoughts and ideas with the world. So one would assume a more original work would have more appeal for writers as well. For example, I recently had a desire to write a hpmor fic focusing on harry having to deal with his vow. This idea seemed interesting enough to share with others. However, after checking the continuation stories that I had not read before, I found out 'Significant Digits' had already explored the subject in chapter 2. Now it seemed mostly to be used as a subplot there, so if my desire was strong enough I could still write a story that would explore the idea further and more in-depth. While it wouldn't be completely original it would then hopefully add enough to still be interesting and new. In contrast since my desire was not very strong I could decide my idea had been shared with the world and not write anything on the subject.

More on the feedback side of things; I felt the rational part was more implied this episode. That might have been for the best given the topic which was more directly about writing I suppose. Regardless you two have great synergy which results in a nice flow of consistent content. It makes listening very pleasant so good job on that.

*** Yep, there was an interesting post in [[/r/writing]] about this recently, where a person wrote a rough draft for a story long ago, and upon finally reading Game of Thrones, realized his story was too similar to it. After revising it he showed it to some friends, who remarked that it was very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender. Instead of despairing over comparisons made between your story and others, the best solution is to focus on what you want to see more of that the others did and focus on that, and cut away what you disliked or cared less about, until being similar doesn't matter because the focus and exploration is on different things entirely.

And thank you, glad you enjoyed the listen :)

** I'd like a set of bullet points that identify at what points in the podcast you cover specific points. Right now I'm jumping around the soundwave when it's something I've already heard, and stopping when it's novel.

*** That's a great idea! I'll record time points while editing the next episode.

Hopefully though as the episodes go on there's less familiar stuff, once we get past the basics :)

** Since [[/u/alexanderwales]] mentioned how much he likes familiar stories reimagined in different settings, I'd like to re-recommend Superman: Red Son. I found a free copy [[http://m.imgur.com/gallery/OIaKj][here]].

** That was an amusing story of alexander's preempted syllable search. I've definitely had that experience way too many times.
