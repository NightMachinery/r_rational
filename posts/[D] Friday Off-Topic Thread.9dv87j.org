Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Going on one of those crash investigation trips I mentioned on here a few weeks ago!

Instead of two 12 hour days we're doing a 10 hour day and an 8 hour day, 80% of which will be in a car (but fortunately a large car?). As I suspected, we will basically be spending the full ~18 hours chatting, and also staying at the same hotel and eating dinner together. So yeah, that's gonna be a whole thing! :/

At least it's a 3 star hotel in a touristy town, which is more than we can expect in some other places we might end up! And our accommodation and meals are comped. Though the practicalities of eating vegan in random "truck stop" type places in the middle of nowhere remains to be assessed.

I'll try and see if I can take any photos while we're out there and post them here next week if people are interested.

It's a beautiful part of the country we'll be driving through, because coincidentally, beautiful tree-lined streets are also places where people tend to have fatal crashes.

Also I have a chemistry test the following day so I'm going to see if I can convince them to let me play white noise on my headphones on full blast and go through my flash cards... And excuse myself from dinner ASAP to do some worksheets.

Also, whoever suggested white noise to my "noisy office problems" thread last week, I decided to try using mynoise more dedicated-ly and had great results. Thanks!

** I'd like to get some art for my house that, when looking at it, will remind me that I want to be epistemically rigorous, honest, curious, etc. The values of [[/r/rational]] in general.

​

Ideally it wouldn't involve anyone's IP, other than the art itself, ie, no pictures of HJPEV, not even the Significant Digits one.

Something that would look good as an oil painting in someone pretentious's foyer. I just looked through [[/r/specart]] , [[/r/imaginaryfuturism]], and [[/r/ImaginaryCityscapes]], and didn't really find exactly what I wanted, but wasn't exhaustive, either.

** As an ex-Mormon with a God-shaped hole, who still misses rituals and such, I've occasionally entertained thoughts of engaging in rituals which I no longer believe have any bearing on reality, to see if just going through the motions is enough to fill that hole.

My worry is not that this won't work (the time invested will be well-spent even if this doesn't work) but that it will work too well, "fake it till you make it" will turn out to apply to more than things which I /endorse/, and by way of cognitive dissonance I'll fall back into theism somehow.

Does this seem like a reasonable thing to be concerned about? "Fake it till you make it" was definitely a tactic which I suggested during my time as a missionary, but then again the people I was suggesting it for were striving for that conversion experience.

*** Don't engage in rituals you don't believe in, but you can make your own rituals (including atheist ones).

One way to approach custom rituals is as a way to be mindful about this or that - some friends do Victory Thursday, which is a simple one: You iterate your victories from the past week (you'll always have some, even if they're small ones) and then say: "I am victorious, and deserve icecream" (then you eat some icecream).

I would say "yes, it is a thing to be concerned about", but that the correct response is to change the ritual not to avoid any rituals. Non-theistic rituals should not result in theistic beliefs.

*** I don't remember where I read it, but I've read that if you consistently pretend to be a certain type of person for at least 6 months, you'll in a sense "become" that person. This is a problem for, not like /undercover/ cops, but /deep cover/ operatives, people who have to live their lives as criminals 24/7/365 for a year or three or more. There's a non-insignificant percentage of them who never complete their missions and disappear into their fabricated personas. So it's not an unreasonable concern, /pretending/ to be more religious could realistically lead in the long term to /legitimately/ being more religious.

***** That runs a significant risk of values-drift, though, no? I mean, you're basically trying to replace yourself with someone else and gambling that this new persona is as aligned with your own goals as you want them to be.

Not to mention, for this to actually work, you'd have to make a major life change or ten. Change your name, move across the country (or to another country), change your mannerisms, etc. The reason people 'become the mask' is because they have to /become/ that person, not just pretend to be them.

***** In hindsight, I did a form of that (it took around four months), although it's gradually fading away now that I'm not putting so much effort into it. I wasn't as extreme about it though.

If you're looking for ways to radically change yourself: You might find that if you develop a new friendship group that has no overlap to your old group that a lot of 'your own persona' is essentially a local maximum given a specific social landscape.

I mean, that was basically Pascal's whole suggestion, right? "Even if you don't like mass, just go there until you just sort of start rolling with it". I don't think it's too outlandish. We're always influenced by our environment, especially in a social sense; "fitting in" is a strong impulse.

*** I don't know much about what I'm talking about, but iirc wiccanism/paganism/etc are kind of that thing, spirituality for non-christians. Of course, you have the same problem, but it might be more manageable without the entire christian thing going on with it.

** I already posted about this in the most recent Monday thread, but I didn't get much of a response so here's me reposting about the same topic today asking for advice.

I'm planning to start my first ever quest. Long story short, the quest is about having strange dreams where you explore a world of horror in a bombed city.

Type - Exploration/Mystery/Experimentation

Genre - Horror/Mystery/Journey

Here's my current [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHLywZ8JPwUhB5CrGHwBW2dZEzShti6KAYdWhOsDLCI/edit][draft]] of the first chapter for anyone interested.

But I have questions about running a quest that I hope people here can provide advice on:

- I want to do an exploration/mystery style quest. This means that I don't want offer any choices and every post will be write-ins only. Should I expect issues with this?
- I dislike quests where the character does things out-of-character depending on the vote. So I want to do a trait system where the character will have bonuses or maluses depending in how in-line the vote is with their (determined) personality. The trait system is inspired by [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After the End]]. Since it sounds like it might conflict with my desire to only allow write-ins, will this be a problem?
- A lot of quests have game mechanics, but I want the quest to be character-driven and to focus on the actions taken rather than stats. Will I run into issues without having stats?
- Anything else I should be aware of?

If anyone wants to give feedback on the chapter itself on how good it is at drawing in players for the quest, that would be nice too. Thanks!

*** I would suggest giving a more straightforward, self-descriptive title. Most of the Quests that have caught my eye have at least had a subtitle like

- Heavy Metal Quest
- Fantasy Border Outpost
- My Life as a Mecha Setting Bridge Bunny Quest
- A Planetary Governor Quest

Also, if you haven't read it yet, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/intro-to-questing.12494/][there are some good links to how-to guides and such on Sufficient Velocity]].

**** u/xamueljones:

I'm confused. Is the title 'Nightmare Escape' not sufficiently descriptive? It's about exploring the rules in the dream-world and trying to find an escape from the dream.

Would a title like 'Exploring the Nightmare Quest' work better?

I'm not strongly attached to my current title, so if you think you have a better alternative, I'll probably go with your suggestion.

Thanks for the link.

***** u/callmesalticidae:

#+end_quote

No. If I were just running through the list of newly-posted quest threads, I probably wouldn't think that you were talking about a literal nightmare (i.e. dream).

Maybe "Nightmare-World Exploration and Escape Quest." And don't forget that it's fine to keep this as a subtitle/parenthetical title. My own quest has the artsy hoighty-toighty title "Something New Under the Sun" but the parenthetical title "Rats Who Are Also Farmers Civ Quest", which tells potential readers the format (civ quest), who they're playing as (smart rats), and what they'll be doing (farming).

Of course, not everyone does that (as I mentioned above, some are as simple as "Heavy Metal Quest") but I trend toward including more information rather than less.
