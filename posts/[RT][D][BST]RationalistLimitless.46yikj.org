Oh my god. I just started watching this show. I'm going to binge it and re-watch the movie. Wow. This is... almost 80% the sort of thing I like to see in the rationalist genre. Has anyone done an overtly rationalist -- including the tropes and methods common to our, uh, shared subculture, that does something with this? Also, what would you do in a world like that where you had a dealer giving you that drug and probably a year to live while using, and also the associated dramatic implications and chance of dying horribly and extended chase sequences that go with using the stuff? And also there are some treatments to not get the side effects or some sort of better versions, but to get them you have to do the sorts of things that happen in the show and end up embroiled in all the crap and go up against people who are further along in their goals with the stuff... How would you manage it given the capabilities shown? What would you do? Also, where is some fanfiction of this? Wow!


** I've been watching the show pretty faithfully and consider it to be one of the best Special Guy Who Solves Crimes shows on television, mostly because it has a very definite sense of /fun/ and /style/.

I've also been idly thinking about how you'd write the rational version of it, but it seems difficult, because there are so many things you'd do differently. For example:

1. If you have an intelligence enhancer with limitations to it, you should put your enhanced intelligence towards removing those limitations. ("There are reasons that doesn't work" is acceptable, but I want a good faith effort to actually accomplish this goal.)
2. Solving /individual/ crimes is not a particularly good use of enhanced intelligence. They should be:

   - Solving systemic crimes.
   - Enhancing the ability of the FBI to solve individual crimes.
   - Automating the solving of crimes.

3. If there are no drawbacks to constantly using NZT, you should constantly use NZT. Limited supply doesn't actually seem to be a problem for the FBI, so I'm not really sure why they're rationing it except as a means of control (which they don't actually have in the first place, and which they've repeatedly been shown they don't have).
4. Computer science should have been the second field of study (after studying NZT and neurocognitive enhancement), simply because of the benefits of automation. This is especially true if NZT supply is limited in some way. Spending ten hours writing a program that can buy and sell stocks at a profit is almost certainly a better investment than spending ten hours buying and selling stocks. Even if you can't build a better NZT, you can still employ strategies to multiply the impact of that intelligence. Almost all the things that they use NZT for are /short term/, which is sub-optimal.

So here are my ideas for writing a rational version of Limitless (the show, since circumstances are different in the book and movie):

- Morra gives Finch a shot early on that's meant to prevent the terrible side effects of NZT. This contradicts the movie, where Morra is just flat out cured. The solution is that the shot doesn't /just/ prevent Finch's side effects, it's also a deliberate method of control with engineered failure states that only Morra knows how to stop.
- Morra is actively sabotaging the FBI's efforts to harness NZT and remove its limits. One of the first things the FBI would ask of Finch is for him to learn everything there is to know about NZT. One of the first things that Morra would ask of Finch is to deliberately fail at that task.
- Finch has been put into play by Morra. Finch knows this. Finch should be putting his efforts towards freeing himself from Morra's control, which means removing Morra's sources of leverage and removing Morra's method of surveillance (implied to be wide-ranging). Morra would almost certainly have anticipated this.
- Finch navigates himself into the Case of the Week format so that he can spend more time on The Morra Problem, since the Case of the Week leaves him lots of downtime (especially since he only needs to perform well enough to keep himself supplied with the FBI's NZT).
- Finch works on the NZT problem in his private time, which he's got lots of, especially since he can do a lot of the work on his cell phone (once he's bypassed surveillance from both the FBI and Morra).

Of course, the show hasn't really made clear what Morra's game is yet; he doesn't seem to have very well-defined goals. So that's something your rational fiction would have to decide. It's also not entirely clear /why/ Morra put Finch in play; we have a handful of reasons, but they seem like they're hiding something bigger.

Or so he says. I've heard there was a deleted scene where he's clearly lying.

This seems like letting the fox into the henhouse. They can barely control him /already/. Ironically, their best means of control seems to be the fact that Brian is a really nice guy who's predisposed to altruism and making friends with people.

Yeah, I think I posted in [[/r/limitless]] that the contradiction is more likely to be Morra lying than a retcon. I'm just waiting for the show to confirm it.

** You should check out Understand by Ted Chiang: [[http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/understand.html]]. I've heard it called a smarter version of Limitless.

**** Also, the movie is based on a book (/The Dark Fields/) which is much more bleak and more of a meditation on addiction (something less present in the movie but almost entirely dropped in the show).
