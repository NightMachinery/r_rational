This post is prompted by the recent [[http://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/24fjb0/writing_prompt_frozen_scifi_w_bitcoin_prize/][Sci-Fi /Frozen/ Writing Contest]]. Neat idea, but it inspires a larger question: should we have our own [[/r/rational]] writing competition?

Most other writing-oriented subreddits have some sort of weekly or monthly contest, coordinated by the sub's mods and open to suggestions by their users. This sub has so far been about discussion, mainly, but the Brainstorm Threads and various pieces of original or transformative fiction being linked here shows we could diversify. I have no ideas on what sorts of challenges the contest would actually entail, though. Thoughts?

Edit: And if we do, what sorts of prompts would we use?


** Do it, guys. Do it. We can have a sticky thread and everything.

** I might participate in something like that, especially if there was some sort of compelling idea that formed the core of it. I am not a great writer, and have difficulty creating original characters and settings which are compelling - perhaps some sort of fanfiction type of thing might be easiest to persuade people to write?

Ideas, in no particular order - Maybe limit to a single setting for each contest so another setting can be used for a similar idea at a later date?

- Immanentize the Eschaton. Write up a fic where a protagonist brings about the end of the world by singularity, on purpose or by accident. Good end (utopia) or bad end (paperclips) or mediocre end (something stops it) all accepted.
- Munchkinism. Write up a fic where a protagonist tries to win at a setting by exploiting something. Both good ends (winning) and bad ends (defeat) accepted. Distinct from above because more likely trying to defeat a BBEG or whatever rather than revolutionize the world.
- Deconstructionism. How would a setting really look like or be? Subideas - a 'man in the street' fic where the events from HP or Worm or something are viewed from someone not central to them.
- Mystery story - with hints that make it solvable before the end, then the solution in spoilers. Puzzles that are solvable by very close reading and have solutions based on people acting like people and things happening as they likely would.

I am not super enthusiastic about the Frozen story, as I think the core characters of Anna and Elsa are basically not good choices for interacting or understanding a singularity-type story, and further there's nowhere for the singularity to go laid out, and the whole writing prompt starts with what feels like very OOC actions from a Frozen protagonist. Also, the 'reward' in that thread would likely require sufficient effort in setting up/learning software and interacting with exchanges and third parties to ultimately make actually extracting like $10 or whatever totally not worth the time.

** To me, one main barrier to this appears. Rationalist stories take significant more time to write than other stories. If you're not already close familiar with, say, network security, you need to do some serious research to write a rationalist story about a hacker. With regular fiction you can get away with glossing over certain aspects or just invent concepts so you can techno-babble your way out of it.

Other time-sinks are working out your clever plots, munchkining, working out character motivations...

Maybe this comes very easy for others, but I'd lose a lot of time from weekly contests :-)

*** Probably better to make it a monthly thing anyway, given that this sub is fairly small. Once a month means that people have more time, and more people can participate.

**** Monthly sounds good. Maybe we should start brainstorming about the first contest. (Something easy to begin with, preferably.)

** I'd be down for that, but it would depend on whether I had some compelling idea to form the core of the story/entry. I participate in the [[/r/worldbuilding]] weekly challenge on a semi-regular basis, and that's run really well (occasional delays aside) - look there to grab some language/formatting/rules.
