Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I really wanted to like Cultist Simulator. It's from some of the same people that did Fallen London (which I liked well enough) and Sunless Sea (which I really enjoyed), and has the same evocative, shrouded quality to the writing.

The actual gameplay though ... it consists of nouns, represented by cards, and verbs, represented by boxes. To do things, you put a noun in a verb, and stuff happens as time passes. As a basic gameplay mechanism, this is neat enough, especially since there's lots of lore/text to read that accompanies every action you take.

There's no tutorial of any kind, only occasional "tips" that don't reveal much, and much of the early gameplay is in fitting nouns with verbs and discovering new nouns, new verbs, and advancing in that way.

My problem comes from three basic issues:

- There's a /ton/ of repetition, which isn't at all fun, because the actual mechanic is just "drag card to box", and once you've read the text and know the outcome, it's just rote, which wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to keep doing the same fucking thing every sixty seconds (thirty seconds at double speed). I have no idea whether it's a grind by intent, but it's an /absolute/ grind. A "repeat this ad nauseum" button would immediately fix this problem, as would "double click this box to auto-fill with an appropriate card", which I don't think would spoil much, because the game already highlights which cards go in which slots, if you have one open.
- Cards go all over the place. You hit the "collect all" button and they sometimes return to where they were, and sometimes go other places, and sometimes push other cards out of the way, and sometimes completely overlap with other cards so you can't see all the cards. I kind of get this as a design choice, but it's absolutely horrible for usability, and it means that a lot of "gameplay" is just "rearrange cards that the game has strewn all over the place", which is obnoxious.
- Once you've learned a lot and are in the loops of (not hugely fun) gameplay, you're left grinding for what feels like a long time. I can't do X because I don't have Y, and the only way to get Y is to do Z until I get lucky with the random outputs. It seems like what gates a lot of the game is just that it's utterly tedious to do some things, which is a bad gate (IMO).

I don't know, the early part of exploration and understanding with a game that doesn't hold your hand was a lot of fun, and gave me that sense of Science where I was trying different things and making little notes about how it all fit together ... and then it morphed into this pretty tedious thing, rather than becoming a different beast. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of an incremental game, but instead of getting upgrades that automate away aspects of the early game, it just makes you keep doing everything manually until you're sick of it and quit.

*** Can confirm. This is my experience with Cultist Simulator as well. Writing is great and it's a cool idea, but the gameplay is just the designer(s?) shitting on you. It's like they don't actually play their own game or something, because these sorts of issues, /especially/ the collect all cards thing, are just extremely stupid and awful.

It shares the Sunless Sea trait that there's all sorts of things that can theoretically end a game run and put you back to the start, and the best way to do a bunch of things is basically either "play super conservatively" or "wreck the game's sense of exploration by looking everything up ahead of time." For me, this translates to playing extremely slowly, exacerbating the issues with the repetitive game cycle. The lack of save/load functionality in Cultist Simulator means that you very much will be losing hours and hours of extremely tedious work if you experiment with more than one thing at a time, so you explore new things as minimally and slowly as possible to avoid the random loss conditions, which exacerbates the slow pace of the game.

For example, you can lose permanent vital personnel if you send them on missions for you and you fail the mission, so for every mission you are incentivized to first use renewable mercenary personel to scope out the problem and also almost certainly fail the mission, before doing the mission a second time with actual personnel, basically doubling the mission time, except you must also add in the time spent recruiting these mercenary personnel so it's more like 2.5x or more... And then eventually you might transition to sending summoned personnel who are more renewable, but on the other hand these summons have to be maintained because they constantly expire and you have to therefore resummon constantly by sacrificing them to themselves, which adds a whole 'nother grind and is also extremely stupid...

There are a bunch of things that the game could do to make it less tedious and stupid. The fact that they weren't already done before the official release is a terrible sign. As it stands now I don't recommend people play it.

10/10 ideas and flavour text, though. But that's all that is there.

** Hello!

So I recently watched a video that was very sad about how "Darling in the FanXX" (an anime) ruined their world building in episode 19. Here is the video in question if you are curious: [[https://youtu.be/IbSKXMFlOMY]]

Note: All of this only applies if world building is part of the story, something that only focuses on human experience or emotion or heroic flaws might not apply to my thoughts on this.

World building to me is a very weird craft because it seems to only be good in either the extreme, where you really know everything and that is very, very, very planned out and figured out, a la Worm and HPMOR or it is very carefully parceled out and is contingent on masterfully dropping hints and little pieces that then lets the audience fill in the gaps.

What I find weird about that is if you were to plot world building on a line, one end might say, "No information" the other end would say, "All of the information" and then if you marked areas where it was, widely considered, good writing then you might have a dot in the middle and a dot near the end that says "All of the information".

One, I think it is weird that how it feels, at least to me, that world building is kinda narrow when you define what is good. (It feels weird enough that I wonder if I am just wrong, and if someone can provide some examples of great world building that totally contradicts what I'm saying please do)

Two, that world building is something that seems, to me, to be intensely cumulative, a lot like suspension of disbelief.

To expound, there is the semi-famous example of people being in disbelief about Samwell Tarly (from Game of Thrones) staying fat despite his adventuring, and how that broke suspension of disbelief but dragons don't. Now, I fully agree with those making the "it breaks my suspension of disbelief" argument, but the why of it is interesting to me.

Essentially, the cumulative effect of the Game of Thrones universe has set it up to be "realistic" in the terms of its universe. This means you end up creating expectations in the audience, and the lack of believable consequences assigned to Samwell means you lose peoples' suspension of disbelief, because of those expectations.

However, if you watch something like Supernatural and a character suddenly shows up with a piece of equipment that mystically controls ghosts and Sam and Dean don't then steal that piece of equipment to create an indestructible army of ghosts to defeat their foes but instead treat the mystical object as a minor inconvenience, well, expectations had already been set, so no one, except me, gets unreasonably mad.

What I am trying to get at is that world building, like, suspension of disbelief, is more tied to expectations than most other things, in my opinion, and is part of a subset of story telling devices or descriptions that suffer from a total lack of forgiveness. What I mean by forgiveness is that in a lot of media/stories if 99% of the a thing is great, like the action, but one fight isn't great, people, I think, don't really harp on it or put that one bad fight on display, instead I think they are more likely to forgive that bad fight by focusing on all the great fights.

However, for something like world building or suspension of disbelief by having all those "great fights" first, when you then have that "bad fight" (fights are standing in for pieces of information that inform the world building or suspension of disbelief) then you end up with people only focusing on that bad thing.

I feel like the two examples I provided support this, both Samwell Tarly and the video by Mother's Basement (MB made a video before the one I linked that applauded the world building in Darling in the FranXX). Now, regardless of whether you like either of the stories, I hope you understand my point about how world building and suspension of disbelief seem to lack "forgiveness" by an audience.

So, all that being said, I am curious as to 1. Am I just wrong about anything? 2. Why do you think suspension of disbelief, world building, or something else is treated differently? 3. How you, if you produce stories, approach world building and how you navigate something that seems rife with difficulties.

Thanks!

#+end_quote

1. I think the primary thing you're talking about is how to execute worldbuilding properly, and the two approaches are "show things that are evocative but don't necessarily have answers" and "show things that fit as parts of a complex whole whose majesty is only slowly revealed over time". I don't think that the big difference between these two is in how much worldbuilding is revealed to the reader (or done by the author), and I think there are other approaches to worldbuilding that also work, outside of those two. I'll grant that the more you show, the more solid it has to be, but that's true of almost anything (including, for example, characterization).

2. I think there's a zen state to media consumption, and interrupting that zen state for whatever reason essentially throws a wrench in the gears, which really ruins enjoyment. Setting (and meeting) expectations is really important for that reason, since what most people are doing is pattern-matching as they go, developing models of the world and characters that become more complicated and deep as the work goes on. Changing those models needs to be done really carefully and deliberately, lest you wreck the flow state and ruin a person's investment.

3. My approach to worldbuilding is to give as much thought to things as I can before hitting the limits of diminishing marginal utility, with special emphasis to those bits that are part of the plot, characterization, etc. /(ex. if the main character is a former vicar who has been shunned by his church, you better believe that I'm going to spend a lot more time making sure that I understand the church he worked in and was exiled from)/

   For /showing/ worldbuilding, I think there are a few general approaches, which can be combined. The first is being evocative and economical, using as few words as possible to paint the broadest and most impactful possible picture. Part of this is just "show, don't tell" at work, but you can only get so far on that, and showing takes way more words/attention/effort than slipping in the occasional tell. Second, you can infodump, which there are various ways to soften or dress up, like characters talking to each other and infodumping through conversation about a side topic, including a fish out of water, etc. And third, there's including worldbuilding through storytelling; you don't give a dry history of the world, instead you tell a story about someone who was a part of that history and all exposition is by way of explaining elements of that story and their impact on this narrative, rather than parceling out bits of worldbuilding, because "my father was fired after the bots took over his plant" is a lot more compelling than "by 2038, 90% of the workforce was replaced by robots".

**** I'd be interested in knowing what other ways you were referencing here:

"and I think there are other approaches to worldbuilding that also work, outside of those two."

Also, I totally agree with you in regards to execution, but I feel if we talk about execution we will get very mired in details, because lots of things that might be "bad" if executed well are great, and vice versa.

I'd rather stick to the kinda of meta about world building and suspension of disbelief, but, like I said, I think you nailed what you said about execution, types of execution, etc.

For your number 2. Based on how you explained it, I think I disagree. I feel like "good writing" or maybe it is just writing I enjoy, has to throw a wrench in the pattern matching / zen consumption of media. If you aren't jolted out of "Buddy Cop Comedy" with something that breaks the mold or challenges you, then I feel like you are, maybe by definition, encountering "bad writing".

However, I realize that when you say pattern matching, you might be talking about something more meta or distant like "Man vs Nature", which, uh, well, that and archetypes like it (Man vs Man, Man vs Self, etc) are the basis of pretty much every story, and we probably won't ever get away from that.

***** Re: pattern-matching

I'm talking more elemental. If you get a description like ...

#+begin_quote
  His heels dragged as he walked down the hallway. He loosened his tie with one hand while the other gripped the handle of a battered suitcase.
#+end_quote

... you start to build up a loose model of them in your head. Readers do this without being told to; if no information is given about skin color, hair color, age, demeanor, etc., they'll fill in the gaps on their own, and the stuff that was filled in becomes a part of that model.

For example, that description /doesn't/ say that the man was wearing a suit, but it's /likely/ that if you pictured him, the suit was a part of that picture. The innate modeling ability of the brain decides that, rather than it being a /conscious/ process of "oh, he's wearing a tie, which usually goes with a suit, and therefore that's likely what he's wearing with probability 70%".

I'm not saying that you can't break from the models that the brain generates, just that /when you do it, it must be done deliberately and for effect./ And this isn't just writing advice of "do things deliberately and for effect", it's specifically "you have to be more careful when going contrary to what people will bake into their models of the world/characters you create". Anything that reinforces those models and patterns gets (more of) a pass from the reader and therefore needs less time and attention.

But it is a really good point, how descriptions in prose is almost always laughably incomplete, but that's on purpose because of the way our brains work.

*** Worldbuilding is something I generally have positive associations with, and like seeing in stories, and I think the reason for that is good worldbuilding assists good plots. A good plot is (among other things) consistent from start to end, and you can't see that in full unless you know the context of the situation.

If the evil empire is invading through a strategically vital choke point, then saying that the rest of the border is impassible mountains is worldbuilding that helps make the pitched battle at the choke point feel more consistent.

Conservation of detail also leaves fingerprints too. We don't care about the price of grain in the kingdom, so telling us would be a waste of precious information-space unless the price of grain is relevant to the consistency of the plot (such as sparking a rebellion). Worldbuilding that isn't focused, that isn't relevant to the plot (and relevant can be even just setting tone or building attachment) is an idle timewaste.

So you've got a push to include enough worldbuilding to prove the consistency of the plot, make all the pieces fit together snugly and all that, and you've got a push to never use more worldbuilding than necessary. Good worldbuilding always serves a purpose, and the rest is aesthetics. Worldbuilding that's got great aesthetics (something something "great towering edifices of shimmering crystal where the Serene Lords conduct their business" or something like that) but doesn't do anything for the plot, doesn't give you pieces of the puzzle, doesn't set the tone or guide you to forming opinions and immersing yourself in the story, will seem hollow in retrospect.

On what you said about worldbuilding suffering from a lack of forgiveness, I would say that's the result of worldbuilding being easier to /fail/. It can be hard to right a good fight, but a failed attempt at a good fight is usually just a meh fight. Truly /bad/ fights do exist, they're ones that fly in the face of everything you expected out of it, throw away established rules and characteristics and don't even reach a satisfying conclusion, but that kind of mess-up is hard to achieve. Harder, certainly, than leaving an inconsistency in your worldbuilding.

**** I also love world building. it is one of my favorite things, but it still feels unique in some ways to me.

I have to say though, I am kinda confused by your point of "conservation of detail also leaves fingerprints...". To me that sounds like it means: Not having certain information also leaves a clue or notice or "fingerprint". But I don't really get how that's possible? Maybe I am misinterpreting your statement, but it kinda sounds like you are saying, saying nothing about a world building element, like the price of grain, can show up in a story and be felt, but then you also say, you don't want to know the price of the grain unless it is relevant? Im struggling to understand the point, so feel free to give it to me without the metaphor or whatever. Maybe im just missing it.

I am not sure I agree with this statement either: "So you've got a push to include enough worldbuilding to prove the consistency of the plot, make all the pieces fit together snugly and all that, and you've got a push to never use more worldbuilding than necessary." I feel like it is one or the other, not a push and pull kind of thing. In my original post I talked about how I feel like you either have a ton of information where your world building gives all the answers or at least is /about/ giving the answers and that is part of the draw. Or it is more tangent to the story, where you give details to make the world seem grounded and interesting, but you're never really going to answer how things work, on practical levels, instead you are focusing on character interaction or romance or comedy. An example would be WALL-E. You get enough information in that movie to feel grounded, but it all serves the characters and the plot, rather than being a main "character" itself, unlike something like Looper (which doesn't do this well) but the world building in that is /supposed/ to be good enough that the time travel and everything is a direct part of the plot, a main "character" I would say.

I also think I disagree with you about world building being easier to fail.

So, the first thing to point out is that world building, I would say, is not a pass/fail scale. So, when you say a non-good written fight might just be a "meh fight", well, I think that can be true of world building as well.

Just like it might not make sense in a fight for someone to not use the weapon near them; something in world building might not make total sense, but you're too caught up in the other good things to really notice unless you go back and re-watch or analyze the scene.

Curious if that changes your mind on anything or if I misjudged anything you said!

***** Me saying that conservation of detail left its fingerprints was just a way of saying that it's also relevant to how worldbuilding functions in a story. Worldbuilding that doesn't serve any purpose, I called it hollow, but it's important to note that it can and often is enjoyable in the moment. It's just detrimental to the pacing and overall focus of the story.

Some settings require more worldbuilding than others, that's something I glossed over. A setting like Worm, with many divergences from the normal world, has to have a lot of worldbuilding to prove consistency. That goes double for HPMOR, where one of the core motivations behind it is making a coherent and consistent world out of the whimsy of canon. in contrast though, a relatively normal world needs very little worldbuilding, and what worldbuilding it does need will likely be directly relevant to the plot instead of indirectly.

Worm needs to explain how organizations like the Protectorate came to exist and how they function and fit in a society full of capes, and that involves a lot of worldbuilding that isn't directly connected to the plot (though it still serves a purpose, as proving the consistency of the world makes pieces fit together for the reader). Hypothetical 'regular world' movie People Shooting Each Other In The Office only needs to explain why people started shooting each other in the office. Not only is this less worldbuilding, it's more directly intertwined with the plot.

You're right, fights and worldbuilding aren't on a pass/fail scale, but what I wanted to convey is that, for fights, laziness and general incompetence leads to boring, uninspired fight scenes that get a 'meh' response, but with worldbuilding laziness and general incompetence leads to plotholes and inconsistencies which once noticed are actively harmful to the experience. There's certainly uninspired and generally 'meh' worldbuilding too, but a lazy writer will have worldbuilding both inconsistent and uninspired but mostly only 'meh' fights. If you want to parse that as readers being less forgiving of lazy writers' worldbuilding compared to fights, go ahead, but I think it's a bit deeper than just 'less forgiving'.

A fight, when done lazily, is not compelling or entertaining, but nothing to particularly complain about. It's meh, and you forget about it. Worldbuilding, when done lazily, leaves gaping, irritating holes in the fabric of the story /in addition to/ the forgettable meh elements.

The differing property of these two story elements isn't that people care about bad worldbuilding more than bad fights, but that fights need to be more than lazy or low-quality to prick the same mental irritations that lazy and low quality worldbuilding easily manages to prick.

******** Wait, I feel confused.

My original point is that there is something unique about world building that sets it apart from other aspects of storytelling that causes people to react more vehemently to it when its not done well.

Then you brought up your theory that it is due to the fact that world building is easier to fail.

But then you say: "Worldbuilding, when done lazily, leaves gaping, irritating holes in the fabric of the story in addition to the forgettable meh elements."

Which to me, if both that fight and world building are done in the same "quality" which you described as "lazily" and your reaction to one is harsher than the other, is that because world building is easier to fail or some other reason? To put it another way, I think maybe "easier to fail" isn't descriptive enough.

Maybe it is because of what [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] brought up in pattern matching. We have a good idea of how systems work, but very few of us know how a fight works. So it becomes more irritating when the thing we understand better doesn't work very well?

Maybe at this point this is just an annoying conversation, but I feel like there is a nugget of interest in here somewhere.

*** Very interesting. and i think you are largely correct only; Have you thought that rather than breaking expectations because it set them, it instead breaks expectations of the /audience/ it attracts? For example, in supernatural, it from the start isn't particularly rational. So the kind of audience who is watching it doesn't particularly care if the characters act stupid and dont use an op relic like they could. While in GOT, it was incredibly well thought out at the start. so the type of person who watched it were those who liked well thought out shows. so when it isnt they complain.

both this and your reason would have the same symptoms you pointed out. a,d would explain also why things like world building are on two extremes. (ppl either care for it or dont)

I don't think your dragon example is completely accurate. this is because the premise of GOT is "A fantasy medieval world with some cryptic magic and dragons" not "A fantasy med... ...and dragons AND where fat people exercising doesn't make them thinner". Dragons is part of the premise, while tarly is an inconsistency with the premise.

A personal experience to support this is that i enjoyed GOT until it deviated from the books. Then instead of complaining i just dropped it because it lost its rationality. rather than not enjoying it because it broke expectations, i didnt enjoy it because it stopped being rational. and i wouldn't have enjoyed any show as rational as post-books GoT, irrespective of expectations.

**** I mostly agree with you, although I think that there is difference that's important to the whole setting expectations and then breaking them and the idea you brought up about the audience being attracted to something with a certain set of expectations.

To use GOT as an example again. For people who didn't read the books, their expectations were probably broken severely when Ned Stark dies. But it was in a good way, because the expectations that the show had already set up, was that bad things will happen to good people (e.g. Bran). However, most people still expected Ned Stark to live in some last second heroics or intervention.

That's why I would make a distinction between what expectations the show sets up (which I'm more interested in) than what expectations an audience might assume based on trailers or hearsay.

But yeah, essentially, I totally agree with you.

World building with minimal information about the world being built is going to be hard to spot - because the information needed to recognise the world being built isn't there.

Nonetheless, where would you put /Alice In Wonderland/ or /Alice Through The Looking Glass/? Both have pretty minimal information revealed on the underlying natures of the world being built...

Nothing much to report code-wise; the networking plows forward but it's a bit of library-gluing and I've only just figured out the best way to organize that aspect of it.  Plus my wife's family flew in, so evenings are probably going to be unproductive for the next few days.

However, over the last couple of weeks we finally cracked the problem of how to shape the world, in a manner that is mostly intuitive to use and doesn't require wonky camera code or projections or any weird shit like that.

As a refresher, unlike most voxel-based worlds, this one is going to be bounded and wrap back on itself, to put an absolute cap on the total world size, permit us to optimize accordingly, and also permit free movement without invisible walls. The fallback option has always been to have a world shaped like a torus--you move far enough to the right and you teleport to the left, and you move far enough up and you teleport to the bottom.  However, it's always seemed like having a more sphere-like setup, where you can go over actual poles, would be more appealing, and so we set out to find a world shape that supports this.

As most hex grid aficionados will tell you, you cannot /actually/ have a sphere while using hexes; the math just doesn't work out.  At best what you can do is have something like a soccer ball--make /most/ of the world a hex grid, and then have 12 pentagons spread somewhere throughout the globe.  This requires special attention for those pentagons, as they represent design and strategic problems that would have to be solved, which I didn't particularly want to deal with.

So what about a cylinder?  It's got most of what I'm after; I don't care about extreme northern/southern regions being actually smaller than the equator, it's got a clear polar region, and the left/right wrapping works as expected.  It seemed like it would be an easy fit.

...but it wasn't, not at first.  World traversal doesn't /actually/ move the player around, all it does is pick which chunk of tiles to load as the player hits the edge of what currently exists, [[http://i.imgur.com/r7zSRLB.gifv][as shown in this earlier prototype]].  So I struggled and argued and [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/453406183554809866/fullmap.png][tried to come up with a way to smoothly map a cylinder's tube to its cap]], but it just wouldn't fit.

We eventually stumbled our way over to the conclusion that the cap would have to be completely separated from the rest of the cylinder tube.  Deciding on a good way to do so that was A: 1:1 reversible (if you turned around and went back you wouldn't find yourself in a different place), B: wasn't grossly proportioned compared to the rest of the world was a bit difficult, however.  I liked the idea of the world transitioning the player to another plane when going too far north or south (probably covered up by generous wooshy snowy wind effects), but still couldn't find a solution sufficiently elegant enough.

I even [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/454103810630221825/JPEG_20180606_210617.jpg][spent time cutting out physical paper grids]] in an attempt to wrap my head around the problem, but it wasn't until a combination of mucking about with tiles in Blender and [[/u/Xavion]] repeating a comment that I had dismissed earlier that the solution finally presented itself:

[[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/454892941887012866/unknown.png]]

The image above shows the cap in purple and the top-most row of hexes rotated on their side in grey.  Basically, constrain Chunk_Width * World_Width to be divisible by 6, and then you can have a 1:1 tile mapping using a hexagon-shaped cap.  It's even easy to do design-wise: just ensure that chunk widths are always themselves divisible by 6 and you're good to go. When you cross the invisible border, you get teleported to the cap that matches the hex you were just standing on, but other than that brief transition it's as intuitive to use as normal movement.  

Having this model finally let me realize why all attempts at a single, continuous, flat mapping of a cylinder would never work, too.  Here is the same cap “unwrapped” from the perspective of the tube:

[[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/454900109767868437/unknown.png]]

The red hex is the center of the cap, and as you can see is duplicated six times with wildly different X coordinates (from the perspective of the tube).  The cyan hexes are also duplicates of one another, meaning that the proper shape was never going to really work without teleportation of some sort or another.

I'm pleased that this was finally figured out, in a way that's not /terribly/ inconvenient to code or to play.  I'm not sure I've ever played a game that used a true cylinder for the world space (Civ doesn't count; it lops off the two caps), but it seems like it should work well enough.

This reminds me, what is the world going to look like?

You often mention how it's made of hexes, with heightmaps (I think) and wrap-around, but what about visually? What will the terrain look like? What will towns, caves, and arenas look like? Do you have something like concert art, or an idea in mind of how your basic "Walking in the NPC town" scene is going to present?

**** We have extremely basic conceptual images showing how it will work from a functional perspective, but nothing I would post here (first impressions and all that). Part of the reason for that is because that's the sort of thing I could get lost in for /weeks/ without actually ending up with anything useful in the long term, and partially because I'm hoping we eventually attract an artist and I'd rather defer to someone dedicated to the task.

To paint a slightly clearer picture tho, the hexes themselves will be 3D (as procedurally deforming a mesh is much easier conceptually for me than procedurally altering pixels) with clean textures, almost minimalistic. Units are drawn using sprites (the camera is fixed-angle) on top of the 3d terrain, which is mostly because I will likely start with icon-based sprites and only add animation-capable ones later--I get lost enough in the design as it is and refuse to get sucked into art, which has an even smaller time:result ratio than what I've done so far.

Most terrain-like features (tunnels, trees, etc) are built out of terrain hexes, but in some cases (buildings, trees) we'll hide the hexes and draw sprites over top, leaving the hexes as effectively just collision meshes. Perhaps I'll go over what we have designed for this in next week's post (and maybe try out a prototype since we only know what technical problems we want to solve and haven't actually tested the waters there).

** Does anyone else not really understand how certain things are not outlawed or how certain laws aren't different?

I think a lot of people, recently, have applied this to Marijuana and Alcohol, where, and I think rightfully so, people point out Alcohol kills a lot of people - [[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics]]. So it follows that either Alcohol should also be outlawed or Marijuana should definitely be legal.

But for me, I always think about cars. Why are cars allowed to go over, like, 40 MPH / 64 KMH? Car related accidents kill a lot more people than Alcohol, or really, almost anything else - [[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/02/15/national-safety-council-traffic-deaths/340012002/]]

It is weird to think that we repeatedly opt into these systems that clearly aren't maximized for people to not die, but instead for, uh, speed? Efficiency? I am not sure.

But our criminal laws don't reflect this, for those we consider murder to be the greatest crime, only overshadowed by murders. And from that you might then assume that we hold human life to be the most important thing, but then you look at some of our other laws, and it is clear that that isn't the case or at least it isn't something strongly considered?

Also, although it kind of pisses me off (towards zero/safe systems all the way!), we do have a dollar value for death/injury as well as for congestion when we calculate the cost/benefit ratio of proposed upgrades. But in my state at least, there's a bright line between "congestion projects" and "safety projects" and "an important government official wants this to be upgraded so we're upgrading it regardless" projects, and safety projects get a hell of a lot more money.

I mean, you have to put human lives at some finite value, and it only makes sense to translate that into dollars. If you had human lives set at infinite value, then nothing could ever get approved unless it was completely impossible for it to fail lethally. Bridges would be multiple times larger in order to have vastly higher margins of safety, and even a small project IRL would be a massive undertaking.

You may think that the value given to human life is too small, or something similar, but I don't see how you could argue that human lives shouldn't have a finite value associated with them at all.

***** What I don't like is that the cost to the economy is directly added to the cost of human life when calculating whether a treatment should be used or not, so that a place where a lot of people have to wait a long time to get through the traffic lights (which costs money for peoples' time and also for extra fuel use), and I don't think the dollar values in those two contexts can just be added together because they mean different things.

Human life cost can be anything from a large figure meant to represent "emotional suffering" caused in a society when a person dies, DALY cost used in healthcare, to the cost to a company for having to train a new employee; the congestion cost is lost wages, extra fuel consumption, and lost productivity of vehicles. They are measuring very different things and I don't like that they get added together.

We use BCRs all the time, and I think it's great for congestion projects which use money that's specifically found for congestion funding, and I think it's great for safety projects because you have to measure the difference in effectiveness two safety projects have. But adding them together just skeeves me out in a way, because I don't think you're measuring anything useful at that point if you're using it as a point of comparison, because it becomes apples to oranges.

  The value of reducing travel time expresses three principles. First, time saved from travel could be dedicated to production, yielding a monetary benefit to either travelers or their employers. Second, it could be spent in recreation or other enjoyable or necessary leisure activities, which individuals value and are thus willing to pay for. Third, the conditions of travel during part or all of a trip may be unpleasant and involve tension, fatigue, or discomfort. Reducing the time spent while exposed to such conditions may be more valuable than saving time on more comfortable portions of the trip. These principles underlie the distinctions among values recommended in this guidance.

No, I'm saying that the more you drive, the more likely you are to die in a car accident; the more you drink, the more likely you are to die from alcohol-related diseases (anything from increased cancer drink to, appropriately enough, drunk driving). So every kilometre you drive, on average you lose X minutes of life proportional to your odds of getting in an accident (look up quality adjusted life years); for every glass of alcohol you have, you lose X minutes of your life proportional of your odds of getting one of those diseases.

My intuition is the reason more people die on the roads (and I don't think that's true - I think more people die of alcohol related illnesses), it's because people spend more kilometres on the roads than the amount of alcohol they drink. Does that make sense? I feel like I haven't explained it very well.

#+begin_quote
  I don't actually know if reducing the speed limit to 40MPH would actually prevent deaths
#+end_quote

Absolutely. We have a saying in road safety; "the safest car is a car with a dagger taped to the steering wheel aimed directly at the driver's heart". People would drive at walking pace in those conditions, and deaths would be vanishingly rare.

More scientifically, there are graphs showing types of crashes, speeds, and the probability of death. Here's one for pedestrians getting hit by cars:

[[https://www.propublica.org/article/unsafe-at-many-speeds]]

It's a typical shape; they tend to have a slow start, a sudden jump, and then a slow demise.

It's interesting you say "reducing the speed limit", because a reduction in speed limit by 10kmh from my recollection slows people down only by 4kmh. A nationwide speed limit reduction would probably have little effect except for reduced compliance with speed limits, unless enforcement was guaranteed.

We tend to force people to go slower by putting in roundabouts, which often have "predeflection" which forces people to slow down on the way. That has an actual ability to slow people down because people like it when their cars stay on the road instead of going onto the verge.

But in all seriousness, that's a neat graph. I guess if we were really worried about pedestrians, we would set the speed limit to like 30, if not on the highway (assuming people followed the speed limit, which is a big assumption).

*** A better comparison would be tobacco and marijuana. As [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]] says, alcohol is just too dang easy to make to be a good point of comparison.

Cars, on the other hand. They're just too useful. Would imposing a speed limit of 40mph save lives? Probably. But there are significant societal and economic costs to that, costs which can be measured in lives.

Frankly, I think you're approaching the issues from an unusual perspective. Laws don't exist to minimize death or suffering. They exist to ensure liberty. (At least, in certain free democracies, they nominally do.)

Also, do laws exist to ensure liberty? That seems almost directly contradictory? And maybe the bigger and better question is: What should the purpose of laws be?

But we have lots and lots of other subsets where that isn't the most important thing.

I also understand that the way that laws got here, as [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]] said have to do with history and whatnot. But I proposing more of a thought experiment rather than a "Why is it this way, practically?"

*** Laws are the result of a lot of history, and a lot of compromises. Alcohol is embedded in a huge number of cultures, and thus very hard politically to outlaw it. In addition, it's extremely easy to make, and good luck policing fermentation. Marijuana is comparatively difficult to grow, and rather distinctive when seen outdoors, so it's easier to police. I don't know precisely why marijuana was first outlawed, but I suspect there was a competing industry already established that would feel threatened by marijuana becoming big.

I'm no legal scholar, but I think intent is generally a big deal, even separate from the specific crime committed, along with likelihood of commiting similar crimes in the future. Take for examples murder of a spouse because of infedility, and something like financial fraud. Unless the latter was massive in scale, the first crime caused more harm, so logically it should be punished/rehabilitated more, right? Well, murdering a spouse because of infedility is a fairly extreme circumstance. It's not praiseworthy, but I think most people could picture themselves doing the same thing under similar circumstances. The crime and motives are understandable, and importantly the crime doesn't necessarily indicate a high likelihood to commit similar crimes in the future. Someone who murdered their spouse like that is very unlikely to go on to murder other people, and unless something similar happens in the future, they could probably live a normal life even without rehabilitation. Financial fraud however, depending on the specifics, is more sinister, because it indicates a willingness to exploit people who haven't done anything to the person responsible, solely for their own gain. If you let someone like that have free reign, they're much more likely than the first person to commit the same crime again, and thus it indicates a greater character flaw. So it does make some sense to have punitive measures that don't map precisely to the result of the crime, because we are taking the character of the person into account as well, along with their probability of doing the same crime in the future. This is especially true if you believe that the criminal justice system should be used for rehabilitation rather than punitive measures, because the aim is to correct the people, not simply punish crimes that may or may not have been intended.

So, things are complex, and unintuitive answers are common. Also, I like to ramble, and I'm not sure the previous sentence actually is my overarching point. That would probably require reading what I wrote after having done so.

To summarize the post that now will never be, no, I'm not saying that it is at all common, only that the emotions that lead to the act are at least comprehensible to a normal person. Contrast that with torturing animals, where it's horrifying because a normal person honestly doesn't comprehend the drive to inflict pain for no other reason than to see something else in pain. It's a completely alien thought process.

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that men murder their spouses more than women do in the case of infidelity, but the emotions of aggression, betrayal, and revenge are not unique to men. Testosterone may increase the likelihood of such events, but it doesn't create those emotions where they didn't exist before.

To take an over the top and mildly unrealistic example, although I know someone where something vaguely similar happened to her. You may not agree with murder in that case, you may still find it horrifying to harm someone that you care about, but can you at least understand why someone who isn't you would murder someone in those circumstances? You can comprehend how those emotions could theoretically lead to murder? That's the kind of thing I'm talking about, and how someone who did that in those circumstances wouldn't necessarily be a risk to the people around them, because the circumstances themselves are so uncommon, while exploiting other people for personal gain indicates a much larger character flaw and would potentially require a harsher sentence.

*** I read the driving thread which was pree interesting and I agree that there are a lot of laws which are not optimized at all. And a lot to improve on. but as to the question of /why/ i think western countries laws are fairly easily explained.

I believe that laws are designed to optimize the "functioning of society". This is because laws are created by societies, and through the process of evolution, the societies which are the most successful are those which function best. So laws have evolved to prioritize the functioning of societies. and at least from where i'm from (Australia) they work wonderfully.

So to elaborate onto what that means:

People instinctually like fairness. So laws should and do treat everyone equally, if they dont you get revolutions. (of course in society in general people are greedy, so this is subverted sometimes)

Death is the final end for a human. Killing someone isnt just the worst thing you can do to them its in a whole nother league. Because you cant recover from it. this is why murder is the greatest crime. But accidental deaths aren't as important because there is no intensive to kill people accidentally. Scociety still functions of people willingly dangerous things.

also people have a instinctive desire for freedom. hence y laws are responsibility based. not outcome based.

Then note that laws are slowly being created and shifting. alcohol kills people, but it wasn't made illegal until the prohibition, and as seen then ot showed us that its already too late. society functions better (and leaves more people alive in this case) if alcohol stays legalized. (and imo this is true for most soft dugs).

With all that said, laws are contioisly edited by us. and tend to be moving towards the safety side.

  Why are cars allowed to go over, like, 40 MPH / 64 KMH?
#+end_quote

How would you enforce that?

--------------

There's a highway near to where I live. Now, highways in this country have a default speed limit of 120km/h. Nowhere have I seen a speed limit higher than 120km/h. (Urban driving generally has a speed limit of 60km/h).

On this particular highway, there was once some construction - I think they were adding a lane or something. For a long stretch of highway, there was a temporary speed limit (marked specifically as 'temporary') of 60km/h. No lanes were closed.

I think I only once saw a car travelling at 60km/h (not counting when traffic did not permit faster travel).

A lower speed limit might well save lives. But only if people are going to listen to it.

And people [[https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2011-12-12-taxi-driver-guilty-of-murdering-10-school-kids/][aren't always going to listen]].

Insofar as that goes, I do think that you have an excellent point. I think that, with proper care, attention, and the total elimination of anything like a long, straight road, such a position could be taken and enforced. (For the purposes of argument, let us assume that such enforcement can be made to work). There will be a cost, naturally. More traffic jams, more time spent in traffic. Nothing that a total rework of most road networks couldn't mitigate.

Hmmm. I don't really know enough about traffic to argue against your stance, at this point.

*** I think there's a number of factors. 64 KMH is too low as a hard cap because people go faster than that on highways. But 120 KMH could definitely be, because there's no place where you're supposed to go faster than that anyway. However, the problem is, how do you implement that? You got two possible ways: build cars that literally can't go faster than that, and build cars as now, but put inside them some kind of limiter that simply stops you from accelerating beyond that.

Method 1 would require a full rework of our current engineering for cars, and possibly lead to a loss of efficiency. In a moment in which we're already supposed to be transitioning to higher efficiency transportation we couldn't really afford that.\\
Method 2 would be a joke, because people would just hack that limiter away, the way people used to convert a PlayStation to be able to play pirated games.

Then of course there's the fact that people /like/ cars that go fast, and that in fact a lot of the absolutely bullshit marketing of cars relies on them making you feel more manly/powerful/whatever, so the faster the better. And that's definitely something that I despise but it also means your hypothetical anti-fast-cars prohibition would meet a lot of resistance.

The one thing I can see, though, is that if we start switching to self-driving cars, those will enforce the speed limits by default. And if they become common enough, and reduce the accidents enough, then people might actually begin to develop a stigma towards obstinate manual drivers, and ultimately manual driving could even be banned on public roads. Which would basically lead to what you are discussing becoming reality.

***** If I had to answer more in an abstract sense, then, I would say that first, I consider the prohibition against marijuana absolutely inconsistent with the way we deal usually with individual responsibility and personal choices that pose danger to one's life or limb; that is probably cultural and, I would hope, bound to end eventually. Marijuana is the exception, not cars or alcohol.

Going to cars, I would argue it falls within a tradeoff. The system that maximizes people not dying is one where everyone lives inside of a protected bubble and never takes a risk; however, many would see such a life as worthless. A number of dangerous activities are accepted because they provide more opportunities for personal development or pleasure. Human life isn't an absolute value, because if we held it as such, that would lead to societal paralysis.

With murder, there's a slightly different issue. Murder isn't just termination of one's life. It's termination of one's life out of someone else's choice, and with malicious intent. That matters. We may have debate about suicide or euthanasia, but we generally accept that if it is your choice to put your own life at risk, that is up to you. Some people don't think like this but I'd argue that's a dangerously illiberal slippery slope. In other words, when it comes to maximising one's utility function, we must assume people know what's best for them, because from outside we sure can't. If drinking alcohol makes your life shorter but far more pleasurable, it may be sensible to drink alcohol.

Another question is of course that cars don't just kill irresponsible or unlucky users, but bystanders too. And in that sense, yes, they should be limited - which they are. We have driving licenses and road laws. However cars also greatly increase our productivity as a society; and more productivity means more wealth, more resources, more technology. Which translates into longer and better lives (ideally). So ultimately there's a cost to be paid for restricting cars too much; dismissing speed or efficiency as pointless is just ignoring the way those things impact society. And of course, cars give people freedom of movement, which increases freedom and individual happiness, which, again, tend to be good things. So it's a quality over quantity kind of thing, statistically; though sucks to be you if you're that unlucky pedestrian who just happens to be killed in a road accident, and all that stuff won't do you much good.

Is the balance we have right now optimal? Probably not. Would the optimal balance be wildly more restrictive of cars? Also no. You may argue for tighter speed limits or different laws, you'd probably be right. I'm convinced not quite as many people as they get one deserve a driving license, for example. Some are too irresponsible or too plain lacking in basic spatial perception to be granted one (I place myself squarely in the second category, and since my home country has been so careless as to still give me a license, I fixed that mistake by never using it any more after it became apparent I didn't deserve it and would end up killing either myself, someone else, or both).

** Status update on the next Vampire Flower Language chapter: computer trouble has led to one of us being unable to edit the story, and the other one of us is going to be on holiday for almost a month.

It pains me to admit this but it's unlikely that we'll have any updates until August, in case anyone was wondering.

That said, we've managed to add a lot of much-needed content to the next chapter, which means we can split it at a logical point so the two new chapters each have their own thematic arc and are the appropriate length, so there'll be an extra chapter and interlude in the final story than originally planned! So I'm really pleased about that.
