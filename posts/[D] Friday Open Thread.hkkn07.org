Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** I've noticed that as I get older I'm starting to be dismissive of new games. My thinking usually goes something like: 'New game X is out, it looks cool but Y older game does all the same things and more with more content, so why should I bother with the new game..'

​

It seems to me from reading some of the game recs on this thread that this happened to people older than me with older games than the ones that are a reference to me. Which is somewhat interesting enough a thought to share.

​

In case you're curious the games I was thinking of were Rimworld and some other newer colony management games which just seem like worst versions of rimworld to me.

*** Rimworld seems like a worse version of Dwarf Fortress to me ;-).

I assume some of this musing is based on me mentioning that MOO1 is my favorite 4X game, as it came out in 1993. Something that you might find surprising though is that I started playing it in 2014, after having played a lot of more modern games in the genre.

Genres also tend to have a natural trajectory to them. 4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time. Platformers are harder with more checkpoints. AAA shooters went from action games to story-driven to squad-based with cover mechanics and now have a pile of open world mechanics they're expected to have. Sometimes that drift is in a direction you like, sometimes it's not. As you get older, the chances that genre drift has left you behind get higher. But that also happens if you go back and play old classics, as happened to me.

Though I think getting older makes learning complex details of new games/genres less appealing. For example I have no particular desire to learn the massive pile of rules and characters behind a modern MOBA, even though that's less than the effort it took me to learn Dwarf Fortress a dozen years ago.

Yes and no. Rimworld has a scifi setting and is open to all kinds of things you'd see in one like spaceship bases, crazy technology, evil AI enemies, space traders, genetic manipulation, human leather memes.. Also modding and all that entails.

I'm exited for Dwarf fortress when it comes out on steam this year, until then all it does for me is to be content for somewhat interesting youtube videos.. But yes I don't doubt it's better or just as good, but with the settings differing there's room for both to coexist somewhat filling different niches.

I think you are likely overestimating how complex the new 4x games are. It's just a higher learning curve but the gameplay is basically the same. i.e read a few more paragraphs of in game descriptions of tech and units before playing.

Personally I find Civ 6 to be good, not better than Civ 5 vox populi but still fairly good.

PS. Mods make a big difference, and should not be overlooked. It matters very little if one game is technically worst than another without mods. We are playing on PC, mods are a given.

***** I'm actually pretty interested in Civ 6, but last I heard the AI was pretty weak, and I haven't heard of any mods that fix it.

The reason I don't care for complexity in 4X games isn't the learning curve (I already know the genre, so it's not that big of a deal). Rather, it's that the complexity so often adds extra decisions between the ones that actually matter. Like in Civ to get a city to full productivity you have to build all the available hammer-boosting and food-boosting buildings, and in MOO to get a planet to full productivity you just max the industrialize slider. There's the same decision ("get node to full productivity"), but in one version you also have to click a bunch and maybe solve some trivially easy math puzzle on the way.

****** That's because nodes in civ are more complex and serve different purposes over time. There's times when you want to build a wander or pop out a settler then you optimize production, most of the time you want growth so you optimize for that. Instead of this node's optimal state is X so it should always do X and when it's optimized I don't want to bother with it again.

But yes you need to build the infrastructure, it's one of the most fun parts of the game for some people. There are also more victory types, like culture, religion, science etc. Sure the optimal strategy tends to be cripple everybody else with war and diplomacy then win by default but there are interesting ways to challenge yourself you can set up.

Search Martin Fenka, he does Civ V vox populi playthroughs, the difference is he does them on deity and generally with some big limitation like avoiding war at all costs, or winning with only one city.

There's a large number of people that can play on deity but most just do the cripple everyone through war then win strategy, he's the only one I'm aware of that actually does things in a more interesting way, granted it involves optimization to an immense degree but it's more interesting than most.

** There are multiple problems with the US systems of government (/[[/r/rational][r/rational]] rules reminder: No discussion whatsoever of US politics./). I've been considering an alternative to the "elected representatives versus direct democracy" false choice (while retaining democratic principles).

*With elected representatives*, there is the ideal that society selects some of its best and brightest, and allows them to dedicate their full attention to the needs of society, and who could in principle even save society from its own misguided opinions. That of course ignores complications such as needing to campaign, needing funding for campaigning, needing to apply spin, needing to form a tribal-minded base of support, how rhetoric can be unduly enticing to voters, and how voters can be mislead, particularly with regards to topics they are not experts in, and have no time nor funding (nor perhaps will) to pursue expertise in, particularly given the broad range of important topics that come up. The voter must decide their vote, considering each candidate as an atomic bundle of positions, moralities, philosophies, and diplomatic baggage.

*With direct democracy*, policy questions are posed directly to the people. Such events are by necessity relatively rare: the average voter does not have the time, funding, and/or will to perform an in-depth review of many policy questions, and in many cases, the voter may not care. The votes cast by a single voter are unlikely to change a policy decision; the likely outcome from great personal investment in educating oneself on the breadth and nuance of a policy issue is nothing, at least in terms of the voter's own single vote. In principle, voters could amicably discuss such matters and thereby disseminate any insights gained; in practice, many (including this subreddit) actively avoid discussing political matters due to the emotion, pride, and identity-entanglement that too often characterizes such discussion. Attempts to influence the outcome of direct democracy may target the average voter, who has reduced means (e.g., limited time and lacking proactive education on the matter) to defend themselves (and their society) from bad-faith arguments.

*Apart from direct democracy and political representatives*, our society does use at least one other mechanism: the [filtered] random selection of peers, such as to fill a jury. In the case of a jury, the government establishes at least minimal concern to avoid undue hardship placed upon the jury, and in return asks the jury to represent their society to perform an in-depth analysis of a specific question and return a verdict. I suggest that such a mechanism could be applied to questions of policy, where each policy question can be posed to a sufficient sample of citizens. Perhaps an expert arguer is assigned to each relevant position to be decided, and a rudimentary grounding in the general principles of this 'policy jury' is provided, with standardized rules and guidelines, and an oversight official such as a judge. Such a scheme does still rely upon elected or appointed officials, but does at least place the power of the final decision in the hands of 'the people', and does so in a way that promotes and supports at least hearing genuine and competent counterarguments.

*One variant derived from the above* official jury is the informal organization of collectives of individuals, within which people volunteer their time to dig into policy questions, sharing the burden of self-education, and relying upon mutual respect within the group, as well as perhaps the participation of competing viewpoints to help provide balance. This is a way to mitigate the onerous burden of self-education on every question of policy while retaining a measure of rational consideration on the whole.

*** This sounds great but is full of massive holes.

1. The biggest problem is who decides what the issues are and how to frame them. That takes expertise, and without representation there is no check on their power. You wave away framing issues even though a massive amount of our political computing power goes to this and exactly this problem.
2. Who appoints the issue judge? Who assigns the "expert arguer?" Is the effectiveness of these experts measured? By who? If your answer is "by computers," that just gives enormous power to the people who write the algorithms.
3. You're assuming jury selection is fair. Juries lay both harsher criminal penalties than judges, and generally less concerned with issues of rights.
4. Random selection means that inevitably some issues will wind up with vastly irregular views on issues. For instance, it's entirely possible that a group tasked with overseeing our nations infrastructure could fill with train fanatics who decided to end highways.
5. Who safeguards the system to prevent from tampering?
6. Some issues are impossible for the vast majority of non-specialists to research. How many people understand the difference between Neo-Keynesian Economics, MMT, and Supply Side?

Even if all the mechanisms worked out right, without people seizing power (which it wouldn't) all the money and influence would just move to the fourth estate.

​

Variant: Having voluntary issue selection means that only fanatics and people with a financial stake in each issue will engage with the issue. Think the SLS rocket. (This is how congressional committees work.)

*** I don't actually think any of the issues in the current system are solved through the adoption of a policy jury. Either the jury is truly random, in which case you end up with roughly the same result as you would have in a direct democracy, or the filtering ends up becoming a political question that dominates the eventual outcome. I think the latter is most likely. You'd simply see a new version of the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture][regulatory capture]] occur with these juries.

Additionally, I would argue that our current system is fairly close to a jury system in some regards, and that that is the reason for some of it's flaws. Essentially, members of congress often don't have the time or inclination to become experts themselves, so they are instead governed by the position relevant stakeholders bring to them. Naturally, corporations and other organized entities have an outsized capacity to bring coherent ideas to congresspeople in format that they can easily implement (up to corporations literally writing the legislation that will be implemented to regulate them). A policy jury would fall afoul of the same problem, where the corporations with the biggest stake in the issue would exercise significant control over the outcome by consulting for the people ostensibly making the decisions.

**** I think there are two key differences.

1. A truly random policy jury can focus (is focused) on the specific issue in a way that a full-direct-democracy voter does not. We do no decide court verdicts based upon popular opinion, even in well-known cases. Take for example, the McDonald's 'hot coffee' suit, where McDonalds spent money on a propaganda campaign to the point where some people believe the lawsuit was frivolous, when in fact it was a case of severe and permanent bodily harm that came after multiple warnings about the literally hazardous temperature of the coffee that was being served, and a refusal on McDonald's part to settle for even the mere medical costs.
2. Another issue I have with the current state of US government is how money is allowed to flow into political campaigns. Corporations are treated as individuals, and money can by speech, so corporations can for example contribute to organizations to buy ads in support not of candidates but of positions espoused by candidates. These groups are disallowed from coordinating with campaigns, but it is my position that such large sums of money would not be put out there if they did not have an effect on our democracy. There are of course other issues (and rules, effective or not) with campaign donations, solicitations, gifts of jobs, or other favors or favorable trades. I will not pass judgement here on this, but I will bring it up as an example: there were concerns that speaking fees given to a politician may have been a form of transfer of wealth; or at least that there is the potential for the abuse of such a system. Or, setting aside the question of whether politicians can be corrupted in such ways, there is the point again that contributions (etc) would not be made if they had no effect: It is possible to corrupt a political system without corrupting or even influencing any single politician or official, by causing favorable individuals to hold power.

That said, yes, there are holes in the policy jury scheme, including extortion, bribery, blackmail, broad propaganda campaigns, specific propaganda campaigns, propaganda intended to inoculate potential jury members in advance against rational argument (e.g., steeping in emotion, and glorifying pre-commitment, faith in one's position, cynicism, etc). This is countered (to the extent achievable) by whatever appropriate safeguards and watchdogs are applied, along with the exposure of the jury to the specific 'expert arguers' assigned to argue each position -- much like a jury trial with a prosecution and defense representation (with, ideally, an impartial judge presiding).

*** An optimal government system would heavily weigh long term optimization over short term gains. I don't think most people are capable of thinking in that manner.

​

What we'd likely see is something akin to what we already have, with policy heavily focusing on short term gains, but instead of it being caused by the need for re election it'd be caused by the natural human tendencies to focus on the short term at the cost of the long term.

​

There are humans capable of this kind of thinking, but they are not the majority or even a significant percentage of the population. Which means most democratic systems will tend to be sub optimal.

What we need is something better, probably AI and algorithms with heavy human oversight rather than relying on our flawed brains.

**** The opposite thought had occurred to me. I suspected specialized AI (or other productivity technology) would increasingly encroach upon jobs currently performed by humans. This could in principle lead to continued growth of "the economy", while employing fewer people. That frees up humans to pursue or be employed in civic duties such as education and self-governance. There might be some marriage of concepts like universal basic income, jobs programs, and mandatory service -- all pointing in the direction of civic service. The policy jury concept along this broader notion of 'civic service' is intended to raise the bar for human thought, both generally, and in specific application within these juries. However, I could only speculate about its effectiveness. And, granted, you could push for more civic education without the juries.

I'm not sure that current AI is ready to be thrown at the problem of governance, except perhaps in very narrow, well-defined roles. Hypothetically, if you have a friendly and capable AI-based government, it is presumed or even defined to be superior to a human-based government system. But I would have concerns about the philosophical and ethical alignment of a dominant AI entity. Not leastwise, there are multiple world leaders who I would not like to see defining objectives for a powerful AI.

***** It doesn't need to be a proper AI, just an algorithm to sort policies that gets built upon over time.

​

For instance, we input potential policies with weights given to them based on several factors like short and long term benefits, cost, effectiveness, difficulty to apply and enact etc. We employ capable individuals to rate these factors for each policy and they all input their own numbers that end up averaged out when imputed into the program.

​

Then the program sorts the most optimal potential policies in order based on the weights we set for each of those factors.

​

With that we have policies we can enact in optimal order that are weighted upon and account for several factors we deem important without needing any tribal or emotional involvement on our part and avoid a lot of the problems we currently face.

The problems you state apply to our current system equally, mine just avoids other issues. Also most things can be measured, simulations can be run, and nothing is 100% accurate.

What we can do is make things better gradually, pretty much everybody agrees that the tribalism and short term focus are big issues. If we can fix those that's already a huge step forward.

There's no way of avoiding the trust issue either, you can move it around but it will never go away without removing humans from the process entirely.

*** I was actually playing with some similar ideas a few years ago! Specifically I was thinking about the difference between polls and direct democracy after the Brexit vote. If a poll can predict the result within an acceptable degree of accuracy, why not just do the poll? And what actually is the percent error on a referendum (would the extremely close Brexit vote have been different if it happened a day earlier or later)?

Decision by randomly sampled poll is quite similar to decision by jury. I didn't think of actually electing that jury into a working group and having them research until they could come up with policy, though (which is a very interesting idea btw). My thoughts at the time were more based on using permanent organizations of experts. I think I like your version better.

In case it's interesting to folks, the toy model I was thinking of four years ago was to divide political questions into two categories - values judgements and policy questions. Values judgements (how much inequality is allowable? retribution vs crime reduction? whose rights get protected?) are determined by routine random poll (conducting and communicating the results of polls is one of the branches of government). The goal of policy is to produce outcomes according to these values. The policy branch of the government produces pilot programs with measurable impacts, tries them, and expands the ones that succeed. Both are kept in check by the possibility of a vote of no confidence leading to a replacement of the leadership.

***** If you use a physical token (embedded in an ID card, for instance) to distribute unique virtual objects which unlock voting, you could use existing technology and infrastructure to build a secure online voting system. You log in by swiping your card near any device with both bluetooth (I'm not sure if bluetooth is the best way to do this, but any similar short-range physical object scanning tech would work) and internet connectivity, and the only way to "steal" your token is by stealing your ID card. Laws prohibiting any other system from using the physical token to verify identity would minimize the economic risks of identity theft through such a system, as all you would lose is your votes (which could be handled through existing anti-voter fraud mechanisms). It wouldn't be worth it to try such fraud en-masse because you would need to steal so many physical tokens to make it happen. Someone could hypothetically hijack the physical token production facility, but if that happens your democracy has far deeper problems anyway.

Blockchain is used as an example of a system which is self-auditing and creates unique digital objects which cannot be cracked even with NSA-level computing power (assuming they don't have any quantum computers, which I think is unlikely). The addition of physical tokens means there is exactly one object in the world which can unlock any given voter account, which must be physically stolen in order to steal the vote. I think that covers most of the major concerns with online voting.

***** I'm suggesting that the system directly prevents them from voting on issues they are not educated on. So if you pass some certified online courses it unlocks a few big-picture polls in the field. Once you get a degree, you notify the system and it unlocks more granular votes. Once you have some amount of time worked in a field, it unlocks more polls pertaining to that field. People with PHDs and time worked in the field unlock all votes in the field.

Assigning who should be allowed to vote on which issues such that as many people as possible are allowed to vote without compromising the quality of education and experience in the voter pool probably requires some level of AI, but it probably doesn't require AGI. Something capable of parsing natural languages could probably assign most questions reasonably accurately, understanding that with many different categories and levels of voting in such a system, just getting close to optimal poll distribution is going to be as good as being completely optimal. The whole point of voting is to make use of the incredible prediction and modeling engine that is human intuition, while averaging out the vast differences introduced by different people being different. So the system just tosses everything into rough buckets, and people get to harness the power of a well-educated prediction market to run their whole society.

** Sort of rational but definitely unpopular, so, putting it here: I've completely given up on WtC. And it's because it's too rational.

What I mean is, it is too /self aware/ in it's rationality. My breaking point was a while back, some speech of Amaryllis's, after the clones thing, where... I don't even remember right now what she was talking about but it felt like the author was slapping me in the face with How Fucking Rational everything is.

I just /couldn't/ anymore.

I like rational just fine. I finished HPMOR. I like it when things make sense and people act like people and make sensible decisions and the progression of events is logical. I can't even put into words what it was with that scene or that story, and I know disliking WtC is like heresy here, so, sorry, I just really needed to get this off my chest.

I had a bad time and kind of snapped on something that has all the hallmarks of something I should be able to enjoy but can't anymore.

***** - In chapter 6 McGonagall says it's unusual and unhealthy for Harry to be as paranoid as he is. Harry's rejoinder about the planning fallacy includes several hypothetical catastrophes that actually happened in canon, including: death eaters attacking the school, students getting bitten, and Sirius Black escaping Azkaban. It's a joke about how none of the responsible adults in canon effectively prepared for or protected against those events.

- Chapter 7 makes a joke at canon!Harry's expense, since canon!Harry was nearly late due to not knowing where to find Platform 9^{3/4} : /Maybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids couldn't become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave yourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the second most important factor in scholarly success.)/

- In chapter 14 Harry has a rational response to learning about the existence of the Chamber of Secrets which directly pokes fun at the kids' actions in canon: /"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said kindly./

- Same scene in chapter 14, Harry casts shade on the illogical way house points are awarded in canon: /Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of and they can't."/

- In chapter 39 Harry makes fun of canon Dumbledore's 'wise' talks: /Well, sounding wise wasn't difficult. It was a lot easier than being intelligent, actually, since you didn't have to say anything surprising or come up with any new insights. You just let your brain's pattern-matching software complete the cliche, using whatever Deep Wisdom you'd stored previously./ (I've seen people interpret that whole discussion of deathism as insulting canon.)

- In chapter 63 an unnamed character points out the absurdity of the Molly/Bellatrix duel in canon: /Ron Weasley said loudly, “Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum this morning, she says to tell everyone she's called dibs” and someone said “ Molly Weasley against Bellatrix Black? Who does she even think she's kidding -”/

- In chapter 74 Harry insults the intelligence of canon!Harry for trying to steal from the restricted section of the library: /He had decided some time ago against trying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library, for much the same reason he'd decided a year earlier not to look up how to make explosives out of common household materials. Harry prided himself on at least having more sense than people thought he did./

- Chapter 84 casts shade on canon!Dumbledore's claim that talking about trauma in the immediate aftermath is therapeutically beneficial.

- Chapter 100 makes fun of canon!Harry's response to learning about the 'side effects' of drinking unicorn blood: Canon: /“But who'd be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?”/ HPMOR:/“Side effects? Side effects? What kind of side effect is medically worse than DEATH?”/

- Also in chapter 100, Harry points out the absurdity of hiring Hagrid to teach Care of Magical Creatures.

- Chapter 107-109 makes fun of the canon obstacles protecting the Philosopher's Stone. For example: /"Nope," Harry said after skimming the parchment. "Testing whether the entrant can solve a ridiculously straightforward logic puzzle about the order of the ingredients is still not a challenge that behaves differently for authorized and unauthorized personnel."/

****** That was very thorough, thank you. To be fair, it's been a little while since the last time I read HPMOR, and far longer still since I've read canon.

Still though, my point was that - to me - the jabs seem infrequent enough that they really shouldn't be an issue. We've got 18 or 19 in this thread. But I said /like/ 5 jabs. Even if there's like 20 jabs, 20 things is like 5 things in relation to the /thousands/ of things HPMOR contains.

If there's five thousand things in HPMOR, then if 5 of those things are jabs then one out of every 1000 things is a jab and if 20 of those things are jabs then one out of every 250 things is a jab. Saying "every time EY would have a character take a jab at some aspect of canon" feels like it's talking as if one out of every 10 things is a jab (like in the Marvel movies (which I like just fine btw, I'm not dissing Marvel) the average interval between jokes is like 70 seconds).

If it takes like 30 or 40 hours to read HPMOR, and if there's like 20 jabs, then there's a jab like once every two hours. Maybe it's that the jabs are more frequent in earlier chapters so they seem like a bigger part of the story than they actually are. Maybe something like a jab every 20 minutes in the first few chapters, then the next dozen or two a jab every 45 minutes, then the rest of the book a jab every 4 hours. You can read an entire 300 page book in like 4 hours. There's like 60,000 words between chapters 74 and 84, that's over three hours.

Idk, I just think it really shouldn't be seen as a big deal, especially when it could be coherently argued that a lot of (possibly most of or all of) the jabs are mostly (possibly entirely) valid ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

People don't typically engage in high level analysis when forming their opinion of something; what matters to them is usually a more nebulous and subjective 'general feeling' or 'overall impression'. For many people, even a small proportion would leave too strong of an impression that taints their overall enjoyment of the story.

For myself, I never found the 'jabs' offensive because I see them as in-jokes: EY is a member of the Harry Potter fanfiction community, and in my mind that membership grants him license to poke fun at bits of the fandom without coming across as mean spirited.

** OKAY SO this is one of those anecdotes that requires a lot of setup and has very little payoff, which is great becuase it's basically how i communicate, so it'll not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen me around.

the scene: The Christmas Market, La Defense, Paris, France, late November 2019.

the background that got me here: I have just seen my now-LDR partner Mathieu for the last time before I return to Australia to live in the Real World. I spent about 45 minutes on the metro to get from central Paris to La Defense, crying quite a bit because it was a sad situation. I'd arranged to meet my other-now-LDR partner Jacques for lunch in La Defense, which is where he works. We had lunch at Chipotle, because vegan food + france is a non-starter. His lunch break was over and I decided to check out the aforementioned Christmas Market.

the story:

I was looking through the stalls trying to see if there was anything appropriately tacky for me to buy (there wasn't), when I found a stall selling vegan food (what!). It was a small and kind of crummy stall, the sort of thing you might find at markets here, but they were selling a sort of chickpea on bread concoction (which they called raclettes, in the traditional vegan style of naming something after something non-vegan which only serves to disappoint vegans and make non-vegans think vegans are delusional as to what non-vegan food tastes like). I want to impress upon you how much a vegan stall in a French market is an aberration. I wanted to buy their "raclettes", even if I knew they would taste like some sort of hummus analogue rather than the melted cheese they were implying. But I was full and they were expensive. But, like most of the other stalls, they sold mulled wine!

I don't drink alcohol. Ever. It's just not my thing. But I'm texting Jacques about this, and he's responding to me regularly. I had also texted Mathieu but he was in a meeting at work or something so he hadn't responded.

Jacques said to me, "mulled wine isn't alcoholic! we give it to children!"

So I bought the mulled wine, thinking I'd have a nice warm beverage treat and support the vegan stall with my money (four euro, IIRC). Plus I described it to Jacques so he could try it out for lunch one day (he hates cheese in all forms, once again proving that the Alsace region his genetic heritage hails from is actually rightfully German), but I was convinced that their attempt at replicating it would fall flat enough that he could eat it (plus, he was a fan of hummus, so a warm hummus sandwich was the sort of thing that would go down well). Aside: he said it tasted terrible, but not because it tasted like cheese, but just because it was bad in general.

I start drinking the mulled wine. It's nice and warm and spicy, but I can tell it's alcoholic because it has that sharp, alcohol taste. I can feel it start to go to my head. I text Jacques and ask him if he's sure it's non alcoholic. I text my polycule group chat and explain that I'm drinking mulled wine and Jacques told me it wasn't alcoholic. I text Mathieu, who is a fellow vegan teetoler and will thus completely understand my drive to support a vegan business while not drinking alcohol, and tell him I bought the mulled wine but I'm worried it's alcoholic, but it can't be because Jacques said they give it to children.

I get a text message from Kaylee, my husband's girlfriend, saying "yeah nah mulled wine is alcoholic", and her partner Bradley chimes in, "yes, definitely alcoholic".

Mathieu texts me back, his meeting over, and says "yeah, it's alcoholic. we do give it to children but it's alcoholic"

Jacques texts me back, "I've talked to my coworkers and yes it's alcoholic"

The stubborn stingy person I am, I keep drinking it. It's warm and I'm cold. I paid four euro for it and I'm not going to waste it.

So that is how I end up tipsy as fuck wandering around the La Defense train station, which actually worked out well because it completely distracted me from the fact that I was miserable about saying goodbye to Mathieu.

I didn't really enjoy the taste of the drink, it was just warm.

I think the vegan-teetotaller crossover is not as big as you think, in dating it's really hard to find vegan men who don't drink and/or don't use marijuana (I avoid the devil's lettuce for the same reasons as alcohol). Like, in fact, I liked Mathieu on OKC because he was marked as vegan and non-drinker and I liked Jacques partly because his profile was a "greatest hits" of [[/r/rational]] and partly because he'd marked himself as a non-drinker (turns out much like cheese he just doesn't enjoy the taste of alcohol).

But it's probably all borne from the same "healthy living" effect that causes the crossover with gluten free.

*** An interesting 4x game that is often overlooked is [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/261470/Distant_Worlds_Universe/][Distant Worlds: Universe]]. Looks like it's on sale right now, so it's totally worth it; I think part of the reason why it's not particularly well known is because it was almost never on sale when it came out.

What makes the game interesting is that it's a 4x game, but not turn-based; it's real-time with pause.

Also, your government will basically run itself (poorly) if left alone, so you can totally just run off and go explore the galaxy while directly controlling a single ship if you want to.

Edit: it's apparently been like six years since I played the game, and from looking at the recent reviews +there's a decent chance it won't run on Windows 10+ it may or may not run on Win10. It worked for me, but there's plenty of unhappy people in the reviews complaining that it doesn't work - so be ready to refund it if you buy it.

*** I've been hooked on Dominions 5 for 9 month now, recently started playing online multiplayer.

Cons: very high learning curve, bad graphics, bad UI

Pros: Very deep gameplay, counters+counter-counters etc, active community, deep strategic decisions even before the game (pretender design)

Lucid tactics, Attica, Generalconfusion are youtubers who have videos on the game.

*** I used to frequent [[/r/Dankleft]], but a maoist mod banned me for having rented out a room in my house in the past. I am not quite sure if the people there actually advocate killing all landlords or if that's a meme to them.

I love [[/r/ShermanPosting]], and you will too if Unionist, anti-slaver Civil War shitposting is something you enjoy.

[[/r/coolamericafacts]] features super niche leftist memes meant to trick people into learning about American atrocities. Amusing for sure, but doesn't scratch the same itch.

[[/r/therightcantmeme]] is pretty good, as is the slightly more niche [[/r/toiletpaperusa]]. Neither are really leftist communities, they just make fun of righties.

[[/r/SelfAwarewolves]] and [[/r/leopardsatemyface]] are also quite good.

**** [[/r/dankleft]] kind of weirds me out. It feels very recycled, if that makes any sense.

Will look into the others.

Have you tried MOO2? That's usually been my go-to for space 4X. (I also have a fondness for Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, but that's got roughly the same complexity as the Civs.)

Well, for one, back in the day, it was a lot easier to cheat at. >;)

More seriously - it's just about the epitome of a good sequel; it takes just about everything that was fun in MOO1, and adds further choices and game-level interactions around them. You can play a simple, MOO1-like game - or get deep into the weeds customizing your species, the galaxy, which parts of the tech-tree to focus on, ship-design, tactics, and so forth.

I like SMAC at least as much for the setting as the gameplay; you might want to watch some of the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8407FAE1DDDA0A31][secret-project videos]], read the Paean to SMAC (starting [[https://paeantosmac.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/introduction/][here]]), go over some of the [[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/96102-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri/faqs][strategy guides]], and find copies of the GURPS supplement, comic, and novel trilogy...

... or go old-style, and just dive right in and learn as you go, the way we all used to have to learn video games. :)

Paean to SMAC certainly looks interesting, thanks!

*** There's an entire genre of MOO-inspired 4X out there: Galactic Civilizations, StarDrive, Stellaris, Star Traders... though tbh I'd be hard pressed to pick one out that's got less micromanagement than MOO1, so YMMV I guess.

For the record I'll note that [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250690/Master_of_Magic_Caster_of_Magic/][Caster Of Magic]], a huge collection of fixes and rebalancings for Master of Magic, is now on Steam ;)

There's an emerging genre of FTLlikes that might be more up your street - these tend to focus more on exploration that the other Xs, but the best are a mix of both, and by and large are much more streamlined than the MOO-heritage lot. Maybe try Halcyon 6 to see if that scratches an itch.

*** As far as 4X games go I'm a big fan of EU4. It's pretty focused in war-time with a lot of tactical maneuvering (if you can force your enemy to attack you in the mountains, that can change the course of the battle, and if you control the seas then a strategic foothold on land can keep their army from grouping up) and has a lot of interconnected systems that create lots of little optimization opportunities.

It tends to become micromanagement-heavy if you go for a world conquest, but the map is large enough that you can conquer and expand for the entire game without micromanagement and still have fun. In addition, the starting map being based on real-life history gives a dynamic difficulty setting: playing as the powerful France is a much easier game than trying to survive Ottoman aggression as Albania. The irl grounding also gives it good ground for roleplay aesthetic, if that's appealing.

  Bit of a stretch to ask here, but if anyone has any recommendations for far-left humor forums, I could use a new one. I didn't realize just how much of my ability to cope with the state of US politics was based on having CTH around, but they're gone now so a lot of things are catching up to me that used to slide off my back.
#+end_quote

There's a discord server for CTH at the moment, and they're working to get a Lemmy instance up, if either of those interest you.

Alternatively, for left-wing memes (although typically less of a focus on electoralism), [[/r/GenZommunist]] [[/r/MoreTankieChapo]] and [[/r/alltheleft/]]. [[/r/GreenAndPleasant]] is similar to CTH, but focuses on UK politics.

(I hope I'm not breaking the subreddit rules about political discussion - I don't make any claims about whether these subreddits are good/accurate, just that they have a leftwing slant)

Yeah same. I intentionally left the specific problems I have with centrist political discourse out of my request for that reason.
