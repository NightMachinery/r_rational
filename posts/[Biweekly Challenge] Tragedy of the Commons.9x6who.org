This time, the challenge will be *Tragedy of the Commons*. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons][tragedy of the commons]] refers to a situation in which individuals acting in their own self-interest destroy a commonly held good, to their own eventual detriment. For the game theory form, see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC%E2%80%93PP_game][CC-PP game]]. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, November 21st.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, they're [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be *Punishment*. There are a lot of different ways that people punish each other, but what I'm most interested in are the social, societal, and psychological aspects to /why/ punishment occurs. Sometimes punishments are intended to set examples or induce specific behaviors in would-be transgressors, but it's often the case that there's no rational motive that the punishment is following from, it's just sheer built-in pleasure at seeing someone else suffer.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/21*. Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9x6zzq/challenge_companion_tragedy_of_the_commons/?][is available here]]

*** Wrote this a while ago as a first chapter - didn't know where to go with it as a full story, though. Seems to fit this prompt, so I figured I'd submit it.

If they can find four more people and a blue box, I think they have a pretty good chance.

I liked your story.
