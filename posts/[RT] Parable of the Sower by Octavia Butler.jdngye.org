I recently read [[https://www.octaviabutler.com/parableseries][Parable of the Sower]] by Octavia Butler and since I don't see it recommended yet on this subreddit, I thought I'd make a post. I don't intend to spoil anything but in case I slip up and you're fanatical about that sort of thing, just take this as a strong positive recommendation and go read it.

The genre is near-future realistic dystopia with a couple very minor sci-fi elements. The world-building is very thorough and engaging. It's also a combination of bildungsroman and journey story.

The main character is a young middle-class Black woman, and the book is presented as her journal over the course of her mid-to-late teens. The perspective is therefore very subjective, but Lauren Olamina is a fun character with interesting thoughts to spend time with.

Lauren does a lot of introspection, thoughtful preparation for likelihoods, and begins creating a personal belief system based on somewhat rationalist principles, which is why I consider her a rational protagonist and the book itself to be rational fiction. It is not explicitly about rationalism per say, but it gets close.

I really enjoyed it and have now moved on to the sequel, Parable of the Talents.

If you read this and enjoy it too, I also recommend Butler's [[https://www.octaviabutler.com/kindred][Kindred]] which has a similarly smart and thoughtful protagonist, and her [[https://www.octaviabutler.com/patternist-series][Patternist]] series (the first of which, Wild Seed, has already been recommended [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/322pu0/wild_seed_by_octavia_butler/][here]])


** Love Octavia Butler's books. The Xenogenesis trilogy is also excellent and has a complex, well-written alien species with logical motivations for wanting to take over the human species based on their own biological drives, and the main characters, especially the protagonist of the first book, may not be totally rationalist but they at least seem to try hard to make sensible, pragmatic decisions when trapped in frightening, unfamiliar situations.

*** +1 for Xenogenesis, which is now sold as Lilith's Brood. Specifically interesting for its take on nonhuman sexuality and interspecies dynamics (as are many of Butler's books).

** I second both Parable of the Sower and Wild Seed. Parable is a really fascinating look at an alternate reality where the ambient level of social trust drops sharply and people just can't get along anymore.
