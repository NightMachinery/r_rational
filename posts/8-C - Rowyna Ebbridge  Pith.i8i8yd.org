** “And that's no excuse for being an ass.”

Really? Being a prisoner of war for 2+ years isn't an excuse for being an ass? Imprisonment in what's essentially a concentration camp doesn't excuse some rude behavior?

Get real, Rowyna.

  “We survive hell,” said Grace through clenched teeth. “She loses both her hands. And the first thing you tell her is that you're leaving her? For some boring lord with a newspaper?” She jabbed a finger in Rowyna's face. “We went through things we will never talk about, but I'll say this much: You were the thing that got Florence through the camp.”

  “It's my choice,” said Rowyna, her voice quiet. “This is for my career. For the rest of my life.” Being with Florence wouldn't destroy her career, but it would damage it.

Wow.

I never had any respect for Rowina, and I'm still disappointed.

It's easy to see where Grace is coming from, too. The power structure that the epistocrats perpetuate is a broken collage of arrogance, shallow social games and callousness.

** Narratives like this always leave me with a bit of a funny feeling - where you have what are basically real-world social concepts explored in a fantasy context. At least, I assume that's what you were going for when you say it's about "assimilation", mws.

Like, in this story, Kurayo/Rowyna basically abandons both her racial identity and her sexual identity to achieve success and acceptance in the society of the Commonplace, and the narrative framing doesn't really hold back on the subtext that both of these are /bad ideas,/ that the problem is and always was the system, not her, and what she's doing is pursuing power for its own sake without really knowing why at the expense of true self-actualization. This idea of people not being able to perceive or accept the faults in the world they live in and instead investing themselves into this culture of hyper-individualism and exclusively personal responsibility for ones circumstances ("strive to become an exemplar" being a creed and everything) is obviously one of the main focal points for the narrative overall, and there's no question the thesis is about how it sucks, both in the fictional world and the real one.

/However,/ where this starts to become a bit fuzzy is in the fantastical elements. Like, in the real world, one can never fully escape one's ethnic and cultural background completely - even if you pass as a different race and are adamant about being perceived as one, there are still circumstances where it'll come to haunt you. I'm mixed, and can be seen as white if I dye my hair, yet no matter what I did, I'd never be able to create new parents for myself or change my genetics. However, the conceit of Ousting basically provides a way to get around that completely, to an extent that it's probably meant to be uncomfortable to the reader... Though I still don't feel like it crosses the line to the point of becoming dissonant. Where it /might,/ though, is in K/R basically using magic to change her sexual orientation, and having that portrayed as seemingly successful?

To be completely clear, this isn't critique on the basis of it being gross or inappropriate to even have that idea as a fantasy concept. But rather, it stresses my ability to associate the events of the story with something "real" to the point that I think it snaps. It stops being a chapter about assimilation and becomes one about /transformation/, and a transformation that is impossible both literally and allegorically for actual people. Even Isaac's story, despite having an out there premise, captures an emotional core that I think is relatable - the feeling of mourning for a past that, if you're being honest, never really existed to begin with. But I don't know how to place the K/R at this chapter within any framework, because it's about her having experienced something that exists, even in purely emotional terms, outside of the human experience.

Of course, it's fine to do that in principle. A lot of cyperpunk is explicitly about what we consider unquestionable truths about the mind being subverted, as is all of xenofiction. But for a story that's obviously Going For It in its politics, it did leave me feeling kinda odd.

*** I don't think the Rowyna chapter is any more "outside of the human experience" than the Isaac or the Florence chapter, you're just applying a much more strictly literal lens to this chapter than you apparently did to the previous ones. The Honeypot thing is the fantasy equivalent of someone who dives so deep into the closet and represses their own desires so much that they become alien to them. Obviously, nobody in the real world has been zapped by brain magic to change their sexual orientation so that they can better assimilate into a culture that doesn't accept them as they are, but plenty of people have /acted/ like that's happened to them, so for Rowyna that's really what happens. How is that more out there than Isaac getting zapped with brain magic to literally give him a past that never existed as a metaphor for nostalgia, or Florence encrypting her own memories as a metaphor for trauma?

**** Well, because suppressing memories or becoming deeply invested in things that have never really happened are things that can literally be experienced by people. The /process/ of getting to where Florence and Isaac are emotionally is fantastical, but the emotional experiences themselves are plausible. (Less so in Isaac's case, but still to some extent.)

Whereas no matter how you much you go into the closet and try to pretend otherwise, someone who's gay can never actually make themselves legitimately straight. It's not a possible experience.

Like I said, it's a fuzzy distinction, but that's my take on it, at least.
