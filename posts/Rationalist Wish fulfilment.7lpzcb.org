It's winter break and I want to unwind before the next semester. I'm looking for wish fulfilment material (this means I need a character I can self insert into). I'm accepting novels (both original English novels and translated ones), manga, and anime (I'd rather read the manga, as written entertainment is much more portable than video ).\\
Requirements:

1. Male (some of my favourite MCs are female, but I can't/won't self insert in female characters).\\
2. Preferably in their teens to twenties (older/younger characters make the self insert more difficult).\\
3. High-fantasy/Sci-fi or a combination of both. This is just a bonus as I care more about the character than the settings, but I tend to prefer those settings.\\
4. For certain reasons, I seem to find original fics more palatable than fanfics (HPMOR is the only rat fanfic I really enjoyed (I generally don't read fanfic of franchises I'm ignorant of).\\

I'm looking for a character with the same personality as Black, not a character with the same ability. A character who actually weaponises decision theory. So I want a smart rationalist MC. MC doesn't need any special powers (in case it wasn't clear).

--------------

All recommendations are appreciated, thanks in advance.


** Easy answer: Mother of Learning. Male teen character, original fiction inspired by D&D, though the knowlege absolutely isn't required, any spell more advanced than Magic Missile is explained. Not /quite/ high fantasy, but close, and has an interesting technomagical scene.

Main character is fairly easy to self-insert into, I know I have, he can be a bit stubborn at times, though.

Read it here: [[https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning]] I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, it is one of my favorites.

** I'd say Pact, but it's only wish fulfillment if you're a relentless masochist.

Heros Save The World, but it jumps between viewpoints, only some of which fulfill your criteria, and is less wish fulfillment than existential thriller flavoured with superpowers and a rationalist bent. Imagine mashing together Dan Brown, Dan Wells, and Wildbow.

Twig: see Pact. If that's wish fulfillment for you, please never meet a genie.

Honestly MoL is probably best. It's a bit dry at times, but is popcorn-y while still being dense enough to be interesting.

UNSONG. It's... Not quite what you're looking for. But it's weird enough that it's just damn /fun/ to read, and the main character fits your criteria.

******** For myself, I dislike having people in my communities who base their identity on oppression and/or hatefulness, even if my interactions with them don't involve those elements. For example, it would make me uncomfortable to receive a "wow, I love your writing" comment from a Nazi, neo- or otherwise. Turn that uncomfortableness up a few orders of magnitude if they actually started spouting their beliefs.

The red pill movement in particular is based on the idea that men should be uber-masculine and domineering, because it will make women submit, obey, and provide sex. That is an abrasive personality that I do not want to have around, and people who explicitly choose to be like that are people for whom I have contempt. It is also an irrational beliefset, which goes pretty strongly against the spirit of this sub.

It may be typical mind fallacy, but it seems likely to me that other people on this sub have the same feelings, and that's why we don't want red-pill types around.

EDIT ADDENDUM: You probably /should/ care if you come off like a red pill type, since it's a subcommunity that promotes strong reactions in a lot of people. If you aren't a redpiller then you don't want to get tarred with their brush. If you ARE a redpiller then it's still a good idea to think about if you want to lay it out there all the time, since it's going to close doors for you. If the goal is to make women sleep with you then it's probably better to save the redpill act for atomspace where you can at least theoretically reap the benefits. No woman online is going to be so impressed with your red-pill-endowed manliness that she's going to hop in her car and drive over to your place for a wild eight-second ride.

********* I'm somewhat conflicted on this. On one hand I think a place that tries to uphold the ideas of rationality is exactly the type of place we want to see Red Pillers come to, in the hopes that they can see reasonable non-sensationalized arguments against their point of view that might convince them to change their way of thinking.

However, this sub isn't primarily concerned with rational discussion and debate, but is more a vehicle for discovering and recommending rational/rationalist fiction. So such a debate about politics or gender relations would be out of place here outside of the context of fiction that explores those topics.

Ideally there should be a place where we can logically discuss these type of issues with the people who actually hold those opinions without dismissing their arguments and saying "You're wrong and we don't want you here". But it makes sense that this subredit isn't that place.

** I've been binge reading [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring (Young Justice SI)]] which I think meets most of your criteria. The author intends it to be SI, and even says it in the title. Not quite original fic as the protagonist wakes to finds himself in what seems to be a variant blend of different versions of DC universes, with an Orange Lantern power ring, but it is a rational fiction take on that which might have similar characteristics to what you appreciated in HPMOR. The main story line is interspersed with excerpts from a parallel story line in which the protagonist's handling of the situation is a bit more extreme, and a few other parallel story vignettes taking place in other parallel universes. The story is still ongoing, but the author seems very prolific. I am reading faster than new chapters are being written, but it will still take me a long time to catch up.

[Edit update] - BTW, I'll second the suggestions for both /Worth the Candle/ and /Mother of Learning/ which I finished the binge reads of and am now reading as new chapters come out.
