I just want to complain about the good place ending with people who aren't deathists.

They present most moral ideas as uncertain in this series, with two exceptions: we owe /something/ to each other in order to be good, and people need to eventually die to have meaning?

I know they indicated it was millions or billions of years but they're still underestimating the power of combinatorial explosion towards novelty, and the genuine fun that can be had from rereading good books / rewatching good movies etc

I think it would take a hundred years just to play my Steam backlog, let alone games I want to play but prudently didn't buy due to lack of time and games I haven't heard of.

Not only that, but they indicated Eleanor is /alone/ after Chidi's suicide. Really? Billions and billions of the ideal versions of everyone who's ever lived and you can't find one friend? Developing a system to help people meet each other would have to kill some time if it's that difficult. Mastering every other person in existence would definitely be fun enough for a couple billion years. (What they like, what they don't, how they would respond to various things)

Writing fanfiction, making high quality fan videos and games, with your Good Place powers would not only be fun for years but would generate fun for everyone else!

Also what the hell how was "bang Eleanor" not on Tahanis to do list? In a billion years my ship can't get one bang? C'mon, you beautiful giraffe!


** Not to be too Doylist here, but stories need endings, and having a satisfying ending strongly limits your solution space even if you're trying to do something novel.

Not only that, but we specifically need to see the characters we've watched have their ending. After a million years, they're not going to be the same people anymore, and the audience will have stopped caring. Thus, ending it earlier than what was realistically possible.

** I answered elsewhere already but since this is a dedicated topic I'll expand on that.

First, while I think the fact that adding "the Door" was too simplistic on its own to be a complete solution to the problem of the Good Place, I also think it /was/ a needed addition. Not because it was the only way to give people meaning, but because being trapped in any place without literally no way out is imprisonment. Even if it's a really awesome place. A free being /must/ have the option to walk out. Every good immortality wish comes with an opt-out clause, just in case.

Second, the idea that the Good Place "turned people's brain to mush" is certainly deeply rooted in our knowledge of the /corporeal/ nature of humans - so needn't necessarily apply to immortal disembodied souls, who might always be at their mental best regardless of how dulled a mortal would have been by unending decadence. However, let's say that they work exactly like humans, which after all is needed for the show to be relatable at all. I think the idea that eternity would get boring underestimates the capacity of the human mind for focusing on the short term. In other words, the solution to their problem would simply be to restore some of the mildest forms of earthly strife; have people struggle for some things, and not experience endless pleasure all the time. In such a scenario, I think it'd probably be possible to continue on existing basically forever, as it would be impossible to remember more than a few thousands years worth anyway.

Third, agree about combinatorics, though a fair word of warning, /infinity/ means literally so much time every combination possible will be exhausted anyway. Every chess and go game played and every book in the Library of Babel written. Whether the human mind could also continue to expand in such a manner that it would be able to fill in that infinity faster than it passes is anyone's guess. It'd probably require these souls to become /super/human at some point, though.

Fourth, about the fact that Eleanor has no new friends and other potential plot holes: see these as simplifications necessary to keep the story within a scope we can understand and appreciate. If one wanted to be accurate, it's not just the friends. Hypatia uses modern clothes and slangs, so why aren't Eleanor & co. by the end using clothes and slang from whatever future era of humanity they got to witness, but live in an endless 21st century? But to do so would only make the situation more alien to us, without altering its fundamental emotional core - Eleanor might not lose /all/ her friends, but she loses her oldest and dearest ones, the ones with which she shared a fight against the injustice of the universe itself, and she loses her lover. It'd still be lonely for her; Chidi, Tahani and Jason are effectively family to her.

That said, the show /does/ show us immortals who are very human in feeling and who do not need self-extinction to feel happy or content. Tahani goes on to become an architect and may live forever. Janet transcends space and time itself, but she's also very human for all purposes that matter. Derek is and always will be. And so on, so forth.

So, yeah, while I don't agree with the philosophical notion that /only/ death and finiteness can possibly giving meaning to life (realistically, how much of what we do in the day-to-day needs to harken back to the thought of death to feel meaningful?), I definitely agree that it's entirely possible that some people would want that option, in a hypothetical afterlife, and should be given it. Just like I don't agree with forcefully keeping alive people who desire euthanasia in real life.

** This also bugged me. I was annoyed when they presented their "moving on" solution. By the end of the episode, though, I was more or less fine with it, and afterwards I thought a couple things about it:

- One, I take it to be established that in the Good Place the universe is actually deathist. There is something transcendental or spiritual about fulfilling your desires, expectations, whatever, and then moving on and transcending existence.

- It's quite unrealistic that after an eternity of after-living they would be more or less the same people. They seemed to explore so little, or rather so constrained by who they were in life. (This actually bugged me more than the dying part).

From a doyist, narrative perspective, it's unsatisfying to show that the characters end up being completely different people that the ones we're attached to (in this story! In some other kind of story it would be interesting to explore); and sad too, as you could think that the original characters are dead, in a way.

In universe, I just assume there is some essence to souls that hardly changes in afterlife, or that maybe changes more slowly than values are satisfied. Whatever.

​

In any case, I don't think a perfect ending to this show exists. This ended the story in a nice, emotional way that allowed me to say goodbye to the characters.

The final shot also implies that somehow by passing through the door souls dissolve in those sparks that then inspired a good action on Earth (the guy bringing the letter to Michael), I suppose specifically in that case because Eleanor had become altruist, so her soul inspires actions of altruism. This ties into the panpsychic viewpoint Chidi suggested - "the wave comes back to the ocean". In this perspective individual souls would only be facets of a greater, single soul-stuff, and individuality an illusion of sorts. Passing through the door certifies that one has finished satisfying their individual, particular cravings, and returns to the whole.

** I generally agree with you, but what we don't know is how much time really passed for them (Jeremy Bearimy, baby). Maybe they did spend billions of years there.

The finale actually made me think about what the optimal outcome would be for immortal beings. The conclusion I came to is that eventually you have to rewire your mind to not grow bored or despondent even after an arbitrarily large amount of time. My gut feeling is that if you didn't do that you'd eventually despise life, regardless of the amount of novelty you'd still have to experience.

** Yeah I've had a lot of the same issues with the shows ending. The fact people don't seem to have any option to increase their own intelligence is pretty sad when you consider how many fewer experiences that allows someone like Jason to appreciate (especially since it's established that Jason has Lissencephaly). Also if you could increase your intelligence then you'd never run out of novel experiences to have, since each increase in intelligence would open up many new experiences you wouldn't have been able to appreciate with lower intelligence.

Additionally it's pretty scary that there's no good Janets whose job it is to remind people of how many enjoyable experiences they're missing out on before they decide to off themselves. Since in the case of Jason and Cheeti both characters seem to decide to "pass on" once they personally can't think of any more experiences they want to have.

Scanlon's meta-ethics are a bit more complex than that; iirc the idea is that humans, as a class, have a desire to explain our actions in terms that are /justifiable/ to other humans. The book used in the show, "What We Owe to Each Other" is an analysis of what sorts of explanations will be accepted by (all) other (reasonable) humans.

** The "bored immortal" is a common trope. I think they were fair with it- it doesn't seem like many people have used the door, but some have.

I think the way they did it with Chidi, Tahani, and Jason all made sense. Especially Tahani realizing oh, actually, there's this whole other category of stuff she wants to do!

Eleanor never got that "suddenly she just /knew/" moment, though . It really ended up feeling like she was just depressed because no more Chidi, which, blah.

I agree with you about the infinite novelty thing. I always thought the show was a bit too tame with its depiction of a paradise where you can do anything. Like, great, you can play Madden a lot, but have you ever become the God of your own universe? And then the God of a completely different universe? And then a warrior monk, in a reality where those two universes fought each other?

** A couple points:

- They present a legitimate problem. If you are forced to be somewhere forever it's imprisonment and eventual torture. All living things need stimuli. There are a couple ways they could solve this problem: they could mind-wipe the individuals every so often, but that's almost replacing murder for suicide; they could try reincarnation, but there are legitimate objections to that solution, i.e. Buddhism; you could try creating some steady set of problems, but that would suffer from a power-treadmill; there could be some sort of transmutation to a different form of being; you could make people orgasm constantly, thus destroying them in another way; and finally you could offer the voluntary death door.

- I think you're underestimating infinity. Any activity with a limited time approaches zero as a fraction of infinity. I also find it hard to believe that there would be infinite unique ideas or creative works. Take books. There's a finite number of books that can possibly be made in English: [[https://futurism.com/meet-the-digital-library-of-babel-a-complete-combination-of-every-possible-combination-of-letters-ever][10^2,000,000]]. The same is true of other languages. And most of them would be gibberish, like the Infinite Library. Yes, you could be occupied for a very long time, but not eternity.

- Also, setting aside how weird "mastering" people is as a concept, most human beings, especially those in the Good Place, would be more alike than different. Eventually meeting each new person is creating decreasing marginal stimuli gains for the effort.

In a roundabout way, the whole thing reminded me of the Isaac Asimov story about God saving scientists from oblivion so the scientists could develop a way to kill God.

#+end_quote

The testing system is in practice reincarnation already, though in an illusory manner of sorts. It's designed to elevate and purify the soul. In fact, the whole show /is/ absolutely Buddhist in all but name. Four enlightened Bodhisattvas pursue the salvation of all humanity instead of only their own; they make it so that humans can elevate their souls through a cycle of lives and trials that teach them to shed their desires, and ultimately achieve completeness and inner emptiness, thus being ready to step out through the door to self-annihilation - to Nirvana.

And then they make it super blatant and on the nose with both the "wave returns to the ocean" maxim and with Jason spending eons in the forest, walking, waiting for Janet, in a state of perfect emptiness, like the monk he pretended to be at the beginning of the story.

I actually found this one of the funniest things about the show. Someone produced and managed to air, in the USA, four seasons of a show whose core message is basically "hey, you know Christian morality and afterlife? That shit's completely fucked up and straight up evil. You know what's not? BUDDHISM". This is like, a new world record of Getting the Crap Past the Radar.

**** You know, when I first read about Buddhism, long before I heard of transhumanism, I mostly liked it but my problem with it was that it was ultimately suicidal. A philosophy where the ultimate good was nothingness is just too upsetting to be satisfying to me.

***** I have ambivalent feelings about it too. The idea of freeing yourself from pain by freeing yourself from wants seems good on principle; however as a person who /does/ tend to have very weak and minimal wants I must say it has a dark side. It tends to disconnect you from other people - who often have stronger wants, and who can't relate to you (nor can you to them) - and kills drive in general. I have large swaths of time during which I feel apathetic or unable to strive for anything special and it alienates me. I suppose if I did not want human connection either that wouldn't be a problem, but are you even human any more at that point? Or are you rather just killing yourself while you're still biologically alive?

** The afterlife that they structured is supposed to move you from being a mortal with limited abilities and questionable decision-making skills to being okay with your real death. It isn't about "doing" everything, it's about feeling the contentment with a life you have built and choosing to end your story.

Other people talked about how we don't know how long a Jeremy Beremy is, but that's not the point, it's that when you're a virtuous person (described by their apparently absolutist virtues that they structured most of the universe after) in a land of plenty, eventually, you will be comfortable enough to pass from it.

It is also, arguably, not suicide, since they're already dead. Nothing that we would define as life is applicable to them. It's recognising that a wave is a shape that the water in the ocean takes for a little bit.

Tahani and Janet also get to spend as many Jeremy Beremies together as they want so my ship is still alive, until Tahani eventually finds peace too.

*** Taking yourself away from your loved ones and from there ability to think, feel, and act ever again out of a feeling like "I don't want to have to experience anything ever again" is definitely suicide.

Death is when you don't do stuff anymore. If there's an afterlife where you can do stuff, it's really just more life.
