How kind of Kairos to continue to feed Cat and the Armies of Callow

** These discussion/planning chapters can be a little halting, slowing down the action a bit, but I actually really enjoy them. They're arguably the most "rational" part of the story, as our characters suss out what they have, what they know, what they want, and how they can get it.

I also like that since EE has never really tried to make the Guide a rationalist story that full weight is given to Cat's emotional concern for Black.

*** She'd have to be absolutely insane to do that now though.

Things have changed drastically since that chapter, with the destruction of Thalassina Praes has lost its main route for importing food from the Free Cities.

Not to mention with Procer devastated and Ashur blockaded there isn't really anywhere left on the continent that has a surplus of food to export.

At this point Praes absolutely needs Callowan grain reserves just to survive. Destroying them would be cutting her own throat.

For all her rationality, Alaya is not too far from the old school Praesi nobility, who wouldn't have a problem cutting off their own nose if it means others get to suffer.

The whole ridiculously complex plot to have Akua build a magical superweapon that Malicia could then steal was proof enough of that.

****** Or the deal with the Dead King. She should have realized that if the other countries ever survived his onslaught, they would be gunning for her head, cost of life be damned. The Tenth Crusade was supposed to be a means to that end anyway, but then the possibility existed that a peace settlement could be reached. Not so now.

****** To be honest, Malicia has quite a few ways to cause massive problems for Callow. Her only limiting factors, as always, are going to be internal. Namely, what she can do while also keeping Praes together under her reign. A task made significantly harder recently than it's been in years if not decades.

For example, it seems extremely unlikely that the fiscal issues Ratface was worried about have really in any way been resolved, since we've already heard that at least the vast majority of the dwarven money Cat got was spent on buying goblin munitions rather than buying back devalued currency. But, on the other hand, it also seems less than likely that Malicia's reign could at this time withstand the currency debasement required to put the hurt on Callow

******* On the note of ways Praes can cause massive problems for Callow:

#+begin_quote
  “As the only son of Lord Warlock, I assume you are familiar with what the Calamities refer to as the ‘Dark Day protocol'.”

  Masego frowned.

  “I am,” he said. “It's a classification for workings they use. The best way to describe them would be /kingdom-killers/. Uncle Amadeus has never lifted restriction on their use that I know of, though study is another matter.”

  --Book 3, Chapter 47, "Offers"
#+end_quote

The discussion moved on to Still Water, which Akua used to /very easily/ turn the 100,000 citizens of Liesse into better-than-average necromantic constructs. Dark Day protocol implies Praes has /several/ weapons or weaponizable ideas that operate on at least a similar scale.

Since the end of Book 3, we haven't really seen a lot of collateral damage on Cat's side of things. I wouldn't say the battles have toned down, but they've mostly taken place in Procer or the Everdark, and most of the casualties have been on the enemies' sides. With open war with Praes inching closer, do you think Callow is going to see Praes unleash at least one of these kingdom killers?

*** I would be also worried about Ranger's reaction, she could go after Catherine if she would decide to have Black killed. But I don't think Cat is able to do that.

But I quite wonder what Black himself will do. I wouldn't put even sacrificing himself beyond him, if he decides it's the best option.

** Welp Cat's a well First Prince maker, even if that power might shatter the Principate and doom Calernia. I'm not sure if Cat can afford to sell out Black though, considering he's the defacto leader of all of the Praes legions, granted there's only like three of them anywhere threatening. At the same time well it's hard to say exactly how much influence he still has even in the what half? more of the legion(s) that are made up of both Callowans and Praes folk. And of course there's both Assassin and Scribe who are the remaining Calamities and while we still don't have much to say about Assassin's motivations or anything really, Scribe would destroy both Praes and Callow in retribution or as much as she could.

You forgot Ranger. Scribe is a honorary member of the Calamities, and wants whatever Black wants. And we don't have any new of Assassin since Akua had him stabbed in Liesse, but the fact that Black had arrangements with Assassin to have himself murdered if he ever became a threat to the empire, makes everything a bit ominous.

*** The Dead King wanted to and succeeded in using Masegos wast abilities and the aspect Witness to see the Bards plan. He got in Masegos head through the Kabbalis Book of Darkness, that Masego used as a spring board for aposteosis in search of power so he could remake one of the fathers he lost in Thalassina, the devil Tikoloshe. Masego had turned the shard of Arcadia and Liesse into a massive scrying implement he was using to search the hells and the Dead King used this tool and Masegos aspect for his own purposes.
