*tl;dr: This is the companion thread for the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9p3joo/biweekly_challenge_afterlife/][biweekly challenge]], post ideas, recommendations, or general chit-chat here.*

I suppose [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]] is the first recommendation that should go here.

The afterlife tends to crop up a lot in fantasy, in part because it's a staple of mythology, and in part because there are lots of different ways you can go with it. It also offers a fair bit of opportunity for making metaphors into reality - the place that depressed people go when they commit suicide is a way for the author to say something about depression and suicide. Dante's /Inferno/ was, in large part, commentary on morality and politics, so this is a well-worn tradition.

Less commonly, science fiction will delve into an "afterlife" of sorts, either virtual existence, cloning technologies, or something else intended to illuminate the human condition, work as an extrapolation of expected technologies, or comment on the human condition. I'm a fan of "resurrect people from social media and digital footprint", in part because I like the fridge horror of it and thinking about all of the things that would miss.


** One of my favorite takes on the after life comes from Vladimir Nabokov in Transparent Things. A sublimely subtle writer, he often inlcuded the supernatural in layered and hard to detect ways in his English writing, but this short story was overtly from the perspective of a ghost.

The ghost's experience of reality is unstable - he has a tendency to "fall through" things into their histories, for example in observing a pencil on a desk he can't help but be drawn into a vision of the lumber it was carved from, the tree that was felled, the sapling that grew, the seed nourished by sunlight and air and on into infinity.

This was a beautiful and poignant picture of the afterlife for me, a place where you can truly experience both the interconnectedness and i unique narrative of every object, from people to particles. It is one of the few ways I can imagine spending an eternity, exploring all space time from each possible vantage point and tracing how every flap of a butterfly wing creates eddies through the future.

I'd be interested in more exploration of this kind of afterlife as infinite artistic appreciation.
