** Hrm. This seems weak to me. Maybe there's a narrative argument about heroes winning when things are are their worst, but Procer's on its last legs, Ashur is basically already beaten, the Free Cities are, well, the Free Cities, and the Dominion is spending as much time squabbling amongst themselves as they are thinking about fighting Keter. The Grand Alliance is basically in tatters.

Without Catherine's drow and dwarven trump cards, Neshemah's got little reason to think he can't steamroll, or at least take some major chunks of Procer and severely tilt the balance of power his way. If we've been interpreting things correctly, his main objective here is to destabilize Procer and stop it from becoming the bastion of Good that could pose a serious threat to him. I can't really think of anything that would be worth a truce now that Cat doesn't have the gun to his head that earned them the short truce they're already operating under.

*** Heroes are the gun to his head. He's survived so long being the Hidden Horror by being mostly hidden. As long as he's the thing which goes bump in the night, he remains a narrative piece which can't be taken off the board. A villain who broods in secret can't be defeated until he makes his first move, after all, and the first step of a plan always succeeds in any case.

At the same time, he must also be a horror. Before this incursion, it had been 700 years since last there were mortals who knew his wrath. Had he continued to brood, he would have gone from hidden, to forgotten, to gone. He cannot allow his story to end, as that would end his existence in short order.

Therefore, he absolutely must make incursions often enough to remain the subject of nightmares, and those incursions cannot existentially threaten Good nations. Existential threats are obliterated by children shouting platitudes, after all. Even though hundreds of heroes have failed to take him down, that is just fuel to the story which can.

He's done that now. He's reminded the world that he exists and that he could sweep across Calernia at any time if he wished it. This part of the story complete, he retreats to the Serenity for the next 700 years, awaiting the time when the nightmares fade once more.

At the same time, though, a massive alliance of every nation against himself can't be allowed just for strategic reasons. Black proved that stories can be sidestepped with superior planning, so no matter the legend he cultivates he absolutely could lose to a sufficiently large and motivated horde of foes. He can't break that alliance up through military might, so he'll do it through intrigue.

**** Interestingly enough though, does Catherine really want him dead? I can see her wanting to push him back into his hole, then sealing him in there tighter than ever by giving the Drow dominion over Keter, but if she actually kills him then the now unified goodies have no reason to keep her around, so they will almost definitely move on to the next big bad that they see, which would be either the Drow or Praes, Cat would be all for matching on Praes so long as it didn't tear up her country side, which it wouldn't with the new gates, but she is kinda attached to the Drow.

  does Catherine really want him dead?
#+end_quote

She thinks long term. Real fucking long term. There are two factors that comes into play when she wants the Dead King dead, I think. 1) She doesn't believe the Liesse Accords can last if there's a Dead King. 2) She doesn't really want people being systematically farmed in a personal Hell.

A new 3) would be: She already sold the land of Keter.

***** I do not believe the Grand Alliance to be ready to fight the next big bad after a war with Keter. They are, as was said before, in tatters already and would have no chance of winning this war, maybe even with the story on their side, if not for outside factors (i.e. the drow and the dwarves).

Catherine wants to use that moment of peace forced by the cost of this war against Keter to craft her own possibly long-lasting peace treaty/new world order.

Neshemah plays the long game. Time means nothing to him, but every wound he takes is permanent. If there's a chance his enemies can reach him, it makes sense to deny them that. It doesn't matter if he retreats now. He can return in a few decades with his forces intact. His army might even be larger from all the dead he's raised and "farming" the Serenity.

If he offers a truce now, what does he lose? He's spread discord into the Grand Alliance, undermined Cordelia's rule, and weighed the scales in his favour. The other nations also suddenly don't need Callow, and the Black Queen goes from being the lesser of evils to the greatest (only) evil.

**** Pretty sure Praes is still the greater evil, and Catherine has made clear that she will personally gate any armies heading for the Tower through Callow. Also, despite being the High Priestess of an obviously evil religion, she's using that religion to transform its members into a democratic society based on rap-battle oaths. Even if Praes fell, Kairos is still the obvious pick as next biggest bad, as he has none of Catherine's redeeming qualities.

She should have plenty of time to integrate Callow under her regime into Calernian politics.

*** Exactly! Our heroes are on their last legs! If the Dead King pushes onwards, it would be almost impossible to stop him! If he takes any more land off procer he would become INVINCIBLE! Oh what will our poor, struggling heroes ever /do/?

People repeatedly forget that this world runs on narrativium. It's an amazing writing technique that allows the audience to be surprised again and again because they keep thinking that this world runs similar to other cut and paste fantasy settings. The optimal action always surprises them.

**** The optimal action is usually to figure out what a storybook villain would do, and then do not-that. Unless you're Kairos Theodosian, of course. In that case, your continued existence depends upon the story of Creation continuing to shine a spotlight on you. For Kairos, hammy speeches and cackling betrayals are /healthcare./

*** Beyond what others have said, destabilizing Procer too much would lead to its downfall. Whatever arises after is more likely to be susceptible to the Intercessor's influence than current Procer.

** Is there an argument for Scribe /not/ being Assassin?

Evidence for:

- Narratively, there should be five Calamaties: Black, Captain, Warlock, and Ranger are the first four
- Black said that Assassin had already met Cat early on in book 1 (though presumably Assassin's aspects might make this possible in either case)
- From what little we know of Eudokia's aspects/skills, we know they would be well suited to an Assassin: She is nearly impossible to notice if she doesn't want to be noticed, and even more difficult to describe.
- Most recently, we learned that the Augur refers to both Scribe and Assassin as 'the spider'
- Despite the above points being fairly obvious (to me at least), no one in the story has commented on the connections, possibly due to name trickery

​

Evidence against:

- It would be very much like Black to set up an obvious story to hide the truth. Being assumed to have a proper band of five largely matching the Woe would give him an ace up his sleeve if he truly had six.
- I vaguely remember Scribe and Assassin being in the same room at some point in Akua's Folly, though given that no one really knows what either looks like, that wouldn't be difficult to claim falsely

​

I'm new to this subreddit, so maybe this question has already been done to death or answered. If so, I apologize.
