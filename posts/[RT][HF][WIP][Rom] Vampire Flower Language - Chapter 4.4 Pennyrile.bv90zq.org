** Another of the short chapter-lets in my "weekly update" experiment.

I'm considering updating weekly on AO3 but only posting the updates to here when I have a complete chapter posted (and linking to the beginning of the chapter) - do people have a preference?

Chapter discussion:

The main thrust of this one is Red trying to work out whether it's really a good idea to romance a blood-sucking demon. (Spoiler: if he didn't conclude it was, then there wouldn't be much of a story). I think "rationally" William is Red's best "option" - he trusts him, he's got resources/etc, and Red doesn't speak the language in Rome, his one job prospect is at a /vampire hotel/ where he's around vampires he isn't personally familiar with all night (and, although he doesn't know it, if William leaves him behind, Red's probably going to get "sold" to another vampire who might not be wanting to play a "charm a human" game like William is). Basically, after deserting, Red's kind of fucked.

I did watch Son of Dracula as research for this story as it's the only vampire movie Red was likely to have seen. Technically speaking he probably wouldn't have had a chance to see it based on the release date, so consider this an alternate history where a certain vampire movie is released a few months early. I probably dropped too many references to the film in the story, but I tried to write down everything Red might possibly worry about from the movie.
