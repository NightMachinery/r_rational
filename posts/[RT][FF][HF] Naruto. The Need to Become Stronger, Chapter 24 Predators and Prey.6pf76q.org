** As usual a very interesting chapter. I really like this take on Gaara. This seems like a much better depiction of an isolated young ninja with tremendous power who likes murdering people with his sand than the simplistic berserker depicted in Canon. I am really looking forward to seeing his interaction with Naruto and your take on his personal philosophy.

One thing that I dislike is the depiction of Ino's "telepathy". It seems that in your setting the Yamanaka bloodline provides an ability to read minds in a manner that is both undetactable and requires minimal preparation. I am a bit uncertain about this as it seems like a major upgrade to their canon capabilities that may unbalance the setting. If the Yamanaka clan can read the minds without being detected why wouldn't they use it on the foreign ninja that have visited the village for the Chuunin exams and why would these ninja risk attending the exam if they knew that their secrets would be vulnerable?

I may be misinterpreting the nature of the Yamanaka bloodline in your setting and would appreciate it if you could let us know what it is.

*** Cheers, I'm glad you like my Gaara. Regarding Ino's telepathy - it's not just some random power boost! There's a secret behind it which makes it look more powerful than it really is, as is the case with almost all seemingly overpowered abilities in NTBS. I think it should be possible to guess the answer at this point, if you look at what she's actually been shown to do, but there won't be a confirmation until about 10-20 chapters later I think. Always difficult to time these things with the rest of the plot...

Regardless, Ino reading Sakura's mind is definitely not supposed to be undetectable - after all her chakra is interfering with Sakura's, no matter how you slice it. She only managed that because A) she knows Sakura and B) Sakura was distracted by listening to Anko's speech while worrying about Naruto.

** I've been going through Worm recently, and I just realized I've never read a fic where Shino properly uses his bugs.

*** Then I am happy to say that there should be a pretty good rational!Shino fight coming up somewhere in the future.

PS: Are you in any way related to Noahpinion? :p

**** That's good to hear! No, I'm completely unaffiliated with Noahpinion. I guess everyone with the name Noah just wants to make a pun for their username.

** u/tokol:

  “For the love of...” Sasuke's eyes flashed crimson, and the monstrous Nanafushi fell from the tree and crashed into the foliage below.

Any reason why Nanafushi is capitalized here? Apparently, there's actually [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nanafushi][a character by that name]] in the Naruto-verse, but I don't think you meant to refer to him.

*** Huh, good catch. I guess it's because I copy-pasted the word from the internet after googling it.
