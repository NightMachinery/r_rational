So, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4oftzh/q_is_my_story_rational/][a little while back,]] I put up my story for comments. You guys seemed to like it, so here's [[https://nowhereislanduniversity.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/track-7-a-good-swim/][the latest chapter]] and a summary.

Nathan Jacobs has been having a bad time. First, there was Hell Semester. Then, Nazis invaded his university. /Then/ he had to go to North Korea to check on a clone army called The Dragon's Teeth. The situation in North Korea had deteriorated to the point where The Dragon's Teeth clearly had the upper hand. In the process, two of the six team members died and John Marshall, Nate's best friend, was critically injured.

Now, Nathan is back at NIU and has had a [[https://nowhereislanduniversity.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/track-4-get-a-job/][/really/]] [[https://nowhereislanduniversity.wordpress.com/2016/06/22/track-6-back-in-the-niu-groove/][bad day]] and just wants to be left alone. However, John's girlfriend is in his dorm, and she blames him for John getting injured.

Anyway, that's the summary. Do you guys think that Bai puts too much faith in [[https://nowhereislanduniversity.wordpress.com/2015/12/02/track-1-the-prophecy/][The Final Prophecy?]] Is Nate right in thinking that The Dragon's Teeth can be defeated based on his experiences?
