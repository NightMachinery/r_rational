Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** From a possible upcoming Bruce Kent story:

#+begin_quote
  Baibhav Hegadi is sometimes cited as a case study of why even the most useless-seeming superpower may be marketable to someone.

  At his top official speed, Baibhav Hegadi can run fast enough to cross continents in under a minute. Wikipedia lists him as the 35th fastest meta on Earth when traversing all intervening space.

  Known limitations of Hegadi's power include:

  Hegadi doesn't have momentum proportional to how fast he's moving. He can't hit harder than normal.

  It takes time for Hegadi to accelerate. In the first second he starts moving his fist, it doesn't go faster than an ordinary mortal's fist. He can slow down almost instantly, but afterwards it takes time for him to speed up again.

  Hegadi can't carry anything that isn't himself. When he's using his power, he can only wear briefs knitted out of his own hair.

  To sum up: Hegadi couldn't deliver packages across the seas. He couldn't punch harder than an ordinary mortal, or fight with faster reflexes. He couldn't race through a building too quickly for cameras to catch him. He could memorize and carry messages, but there's a cheaper way to send those across continents, and it's called email. He couldn't even run out for lunch, except to a restaurant that would serve him without credit cards while he was wearing only a posing pouch.

  [[/r/masks]] voted Baibhav Hegadi as #4 on the list of "world's most disappointing superpowers", as measured by the contrast between apparent power and actual usability. He was the 35th fastest person on Earth, and he ran an electric-scooter dealership in Amalapuram.

  Shortly after that vote, the Masculine Mongoose ran into an interdimensional historian, who offered him benefits in exchange for being notified of the time and place if the Mongoose was doing something of interest. This interdimensional being could only be reached by going through an alternate-world portal in an undisclosed location, and crossing a long stretch of desert where radios didn't work.

  So the Mongoose hired Baibhav Hegadi to act as his personal messenger, racing over to tell the Hilbert-Space Historian whenever the Mongoose was about to go into action. It went to show, said the Mongoose, that few superpowers were truly useless.

Am I missing anything about other people who'd be bidding big bucks on Hegadi's services? Or rather, does his power need to be nerfed further to prevent that?

*** Mundane answer: search. Missing people, criminals, rare species, surface signs of ore deposits - many people who hire whole expeditions or search parties for months can instead hire Baibhav Hegadi for a day.

If we are allowed to bring in metas and portals and such - his potential is limitless. Maybe there is a meta who can teleport, but only to familiar people - with Hegadi she can teleport to anywhere within a continent. Maybe his hair retain meta-properties even when not in contact with him and can be used by Tinkers to create hyper-efficient batteries and scalable quantum computers. Maybe there is a powerful but slow ghost-like meta who can consensually possess Hegadi. Maybe meta-gangs would really like a reliable and nonthreatening messenger because guys who regularly turn into flaming dragons and pools of radioactive acid can't be expected to have a phone on them at all times.

*** It depends on how flashy and noticeable he is when he is traversing, and how much area he can search when running at high speeds.

The restrictions make it so that he is the best man for the specific situation where someone wants information to travel to a place where electronic communication isn't possible or avoided AND they want to lower the chance that accurate coordinates would be found. If he isn't noticeable and his ability to search is decent, he could deliver information to hidden criminal or governmental bases. Since he can't bring anything other than himself with him, that means tracking devices would never be found on him, which may be an issue for other speedsters.

**** Oh nice! I didn't think about exploiting the fact that he leaves stuff behind when he moves! I wonder what exactly gets carried and what doesn't. Does he leave behind all germs and thus can enter sterile environments without contaminating them? (But how would that work without killing the beneficial bacteria that his body needs?) Do any implants in his body get left behind? Could you embed a computer chip and so have him carry it? What about a pacemaker?

Could you somehow store a large amount of information into his body but not his mind (if the information needs to be kept secret from him too)? Maybe an intricate tattoo that would be scanned, or injecting him with artificially designed proteins/DNA/etc. (maybe stored in dead bacteria or hair) that encode a complex message?

​

EDIT: More thoughts: he would be useful in various diplomatic situations where you need to prove you have peaceful intentions, because it would be incredibly easy for Hegadi to prove that he is unarmed and not carrying a wire: just move at high speed for a moment and he loses any such things.

Also, since Hegadi isn't starving to death after moving at super speeds, I'm assuming that the nutrients in his body don't get left behind. Stuff him full of nutrients at one end, and extract them at the other end of the journey. That would be fast transport for anything that can be put in his body without killing him or passing some "unnaturalness" threshold. Hegadi could be a great paramedic: inject himself with extra blood at the hospital, run to the emergency patient, transfer his blood to the patient. Especially if Hegadi has blood type O.

***** Depending how fast he is, he has basically either local or global omniscience. He would be amazing at information gathering. He can tell you exactly where your targets are, how many there are, are they carrying obvious weapons or items of note.

He could sell his services to government who wants to know how many bears there are in the forest. Or police, who would like to know if the criminal has hostages, weapons, other criminals to help him...

He could learn to use a sling as a weapon. Knit one from his hair, use rocks that are laying around. He should find someone mad scientist who could grow his hair in a lab so he could have rope made of it and bag criminals with it.

He can stop instantly, so he could just stop in front of a running enemy and have his leg in a convenient position to trip them. Or just kick them, it is a free hit even if the damage is just what a normal human can do!

*** Hegadi moves from place A to place B at pretty immense speeds. Importantly, there is air between A and B.

Hegadi must either displace or phase through the intervening air. If he displaces it, then his running is followed by a boom as the air rushes back into the suddenly-displaced area. At the same time, loose objects in the area get blown around by the motion of the air, and the atmosphere gets stirred up in all sorts of interesting ways.

Can he disarm tornados or hurricanes by running through them in certain patterns? (I think he's faster than their winds already, so the wind speed shouldn't bother him. Maybe the pressure differential is an issue?)

Alternatively, he might phase through air. In which case, can he also phase through other things? Can he enter a locked room if he moves at enough speed? If someone locks their keys in a car, can he run into the car and unlock it from the inside with the keys that are already there? (Does he need to breathe while he runs?)

It looks like food sitting in his digestive tract counts as Baibhav, because otherwise he'd have to fast to go fast, and he /definitely/ wouldn't be able to go out for lunch at far-away eccentric restaurants.

Are there any superheroes in this setting who can shrink? Specifically, are there any who can shrink small enough to ride in Baibhav's stomach? If so, he could be the world's first vore-based means of ultra-high-speed travel.

(More prosaically, he could probably transport digestible medicines quickly to anywhere they're urgently needed, as long as they're wrapped in a protective container that'll take more than a minute to digest.)

*** He's still awesome for carrying information around when emails aren't an option. Delivering info to an interdimensional historian is only one example. Other examples:

- If the information that needs to be transferred needs to also be highly secure. It is probably easier to hack emails over the internet than to hack Hegadi's mind, even or especially in a world with superpowers. So Hegadi could totally find employment as a fast secure message carrier in many intelligence agencies/security companies/etc.
- If the information needs to be transferred to/from a location where electronic equipment is being deliberately hampered. War zones for example. Jammers, EMP, targeted destruction of power plants, communication satellites other facilities may make electronic communication unreliable. In which case Hegadi is now a highly valuable information channel between the war zone and headquarters, or other places it may need to go. So various militaries and other combat groups would be interested in Hegadi as a countermeasure for information jamming.
- If the information that needs to be transferred is difficult to convert into electronic formats (maybe only at the sender's location). Examples: tastes, smells, beauty, other "human experiences". If, for whatever reason, such a property of two objects needs to be compared, and one object is a great distance away from the other, then Hegadi is the best and possibly only option. So Hegadi may be of interest to some scientific research groups.

It's disappointing seeming in terms of making you rich or doing good for the world, but you get to travel on the weekends, or maybe even in your evenings after work (the acceleration sounds like it takes a few minutes, not hours). Assuming you can find an understanding hotel chain or the like.

*** The fact that Baibhav always leaves everything behind may be the greatest strength of the power: traveling through areas that would injure anyone else with acid or disease.

The fact that he's already going through interdimensional portals is a pretty big deal. Presumably, interdimensional portals have a /disease contamination/ problem that is relatively unfeasible to solve if the portal is not in a fixed location.

Baibhav can pass messages between dimensions without worrying about cross contamination, because he leaves the diseases behind when he goes.

(Like how planes with exhaust can leave messages, except without the exhaust.) Also his power can move air, which might be detectable.

The momentum cap despite speed might have physics ramifications. He can also be used as a diversion, or help with search and rescue - particularly the search (on land at least).

*** Another big thing: He speeds up but his momentum does not increase.

This means that his mass must decrease proportionally to his speed.

Assuming that Baibhav's speed is capped only by the distance of a running start, and that portals exist (to give him an infinite-distance running start), Baibhav could survive entering the event horizon of a black hole (and come back out). He couldn't pull anything back out from the black hole, but if there are wormhole teleportation/time travel shenanigans in this world, Baibhav can abuse them endlessly.

** Okay so I had an idea I'm playing around with. Suppose you have a magic ability that allows you to become more easily skilled in combat manouvers (shooting accuracy, hand to hand, swordfighting). You have to specifically practice the skill you want to improve in for a designated amount of time, and then you'd be accomplished in only that skill. However, it would take much less time than normal to completely master it. You also would not increase your muscle mass proportionally, so you're not going to get ripped. But if you want to become a professional sniper? Might take 2-4 weeks of practice.

Any suggestions for how to use this power? What about for adding conditions or limitations to its use?

*** Sorta like a toned down version of The Matrix's /I know kung fu/ brain upload?

If you can only choose and master one (up to the degree that your body's current physical limitations allow), then the ability sounds relatively limited by itself because it doesn't allow you to exceed human limitations. Thus, mastering something like shooting, where the gun is a force multiplier that other humans can't react to, is much better than CQC or other melee limb-waving. But if this magic ability were accessible to a lot of people, then some forms of combat might fill a niche in non-lethal scenarios.

**** Yep, kinda like the kung fu thing. :)

My original idea was that you could learn multiple skills as long as you trained them, but having a cap on the number might be interesting. I've been debating whether or not you could hypertrain other skills too like running, dodging, reflexes, etc. They're necessary for combat, so theoretically they should improve to an extent. But I'm not sure if you could use this ability to, like, be a fast runner or juggle flaming swords or something.

If the ability could be given to other people, it would be interesting to see what comes out of that. We could potentially end up with some "Into the Badlands" level of martial arts battles.

***** Oh, I misunderstood, thought it was one ability only. So the ability doesn't grant any physical gainz, but does give theoretical/technical know-how. Yeah, you'll need to draw a fine line between combat-related ability and general motor coordination/performance, as well as associated skills and knowledge (like exploiting human anatomy or the environment).

I think there are a few Worm fics where the power is similar - like Victor's skill thievery (e.g. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/claim-the-spoils-victor-taylor.708364/][Claim the Spoils]]) or even [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/%C3%9Cber][canon Uber's power]]:

  Über's power grants him a high level of skill at anything he tries his hand at, with better skill the more he focuses.[3] Wildbow has commented that people tend to overestimate his power - "it would perhaps be better to say that he's able to learn techniques."[4]

  He can for example do a martial arts recovery but does not have the broader skill, proper balance and poise a real martial artist would have.[5] He could probably focus in order to become an expert at escaping handcuffs or ropes if he was restrained.[6]

*** One limitation that would be interesting and I haven't seen done before is if you also forgot skills just as fast. Which only makes sense if you think about it: if your ability means weeks of training are years of training for other people, then weeks of not training should be years of not training for other people. If you don't use a combat maneuver for a few weeks, you should become really really rusty.

Then, since there are only so many hours in a week, and you probably won't want to spend every waking moment training, that puts a soft cap on the number of skills you can be a master in at any time.

One good way to use it is to then rotate training among a large number of different skills, and regularly show off any skills you currently have mastered. That way it looks like you are a master of all kinds of skills (when in reality you only have a few mastered at any time).

*** One thing that could be done to maybe abuse this ability is to add a 'while' to any skill you train. For example: is the skill 'shooting while reading' a combat skill? What about 'reading while shooting'? Because if either of those can be trained, then you can effectively train speedreading, because taking in information quicker will allow you to glance at your book less, and thus get better at the skill. At the same time, you're indirectly training a non-combat skill. Sure, maybe you're only able to speed-read while at the shooting range, but that's better than not being able to do that. Replace 'reading' with any number of time-sensitive skills, like typing entries into spreadsheets, or even more complex tasks like writing, and even if your talent doesn't directly translate to doing the skill on its own, you'll still learn something indirectly which you can attempt to fit into the non-combat version of that skill as a side thing.

But reading a crime novel while firing a revolver probably wouldn't make you a speed reader, since you don't need that skill to survive or be better at shooting accurately.

This, when applied to clothing can reduce drag when flying at high speeds, and also make cool skates, sleds, etc. Wheels would become obsolete unless you're wanting to use them around muggles (in which case frictionless bearings and axles are awesome). Faster projectiles would be a thing as well.

On the other side, gripping gloves for climbing like a gecko might work, or really effective velcro.

*** Oddly enough, outside of industrial processes, I don't think frictionless surfaces are all that useful. I guess they'd also be useful for physics 101 demonstrations, maybe you could also procure some massless rope.

Frictionless surfaces have all sorts of interesting possibilities for sports and games though. Frictionless billiards might be dull (the balls take ages to stop and always stop touching each other or walls), but if you could combine it with perfectly elastic collisions and impose a time limit to take your shots, that becomes a very different game. If you have some sort of repelling charm to get around a frictionless surface (ice skates need friction to turn you), but as soon as you've added that you've got wizard hockey.

**** Yeah I was thinking of all those jokes about physicists saying, "given a perfect sphere and ignoring friction..." etc.

I do love the idea of wizarding hockey! My wizards have wings on the heels of their shoes and boots as a matter of course, so they'd likely use those to turn.

*** +If someone made your skates frictionless, wouldn't you move down the floor's tilt (no matter how slight) at the same acceleration as if you were in free-fall? Sounds impossibly dangerous to use without tracks and a pulley.+

*** One thing to wonder is whether increasing the friction of an object would also make it better at stopping things that aren't sliding on it. For example, if I have a shield, and I increase its friction, would it now be better at defending against attacks? I would think so, especially if the attacks penetrate the shield, because now they would be rubbing up against the shield and so slowing down.

Unfortunately, since this is the HP universe, most combat uses non-physical spells, so your friction wouldn't do anything.

**** But conjuring or transfiguring physical attacks or launching enchanted physical objects at an opponent are all used. A shield that dramatically increases air friction could slow projectiles, I'm guessing, but it would be much easier to simply have a shield that halts the momentum of incoming objects.

*** If I create high-friction climbing-gecko-gloves to climb a wall, but my opponent makes the wall frictionless, then what happens when I try to climb it?

If I make a ball frictionless, does it ignore air resistance when thrown? (Actually, can I throw it? Can I even grip it?)

***** Haven't the foggiest. I mentioned then because they were given in the parent comment as a suggested result of heightened friction.

Stripped of extraneous framing details, the substance of my question is this; if object A is enchanted frictionless, and B is enchanted high-friction, then what happens when A and B are bought into contact?
