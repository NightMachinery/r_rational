** Well, I've been reading several things in the past few months, but most of this sub probably knows the majority of them already. Still, in case you missed any, or haven't checked them out yet, here are my most recent picks:

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] recently finished its third book, and remains as captivating as ever. The fantasy world in APGtE is a battleground for a meta-war between Good and Evil, where each side has heroes or villains empowered by archetypal Names. The story revolves around an orphan girl named Catherine Foundling, who has grown up in the (Good) country of Callow under the occupation of their (Evil) neighboring country, Praes. Catherine gets an opportunity to take the Name of Squire to serve under Praes' villainous Black Knight, and begins her journey to save her country through practical Evil.

It's a fantastic story with a very active commentary section. Some aspects aren't purely rational - I mean, it literally is "Good" versus "Evil" - but the nuance between "Good/Evil" and "good/evil" is the central theme at play. Lots of great characters, amazing banter, intense battles, and a large amount of foreshadowing that leads to constant threads about what's going to happen next.

Also on hiatus after finishing its 13th book is [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]]... although looking at it now, there have been two bonus chapters released recently, so it's likely to start again soon! The story is honestly pretty sprawling and hard to sum up. The world setting mixes genres; early on it mostly sticks to a combination of fantasy and western (the wild west, but with wands and magic), but later adds hints of industrial revolution, steampunk, and sci-fi. The main story revolves around a group of eight freshmen starting at the magical University at Last Rock, run by the 3000 year old elven archmage Arachne Tellwryn. But there are B plot stories, and C plot stories, and throwaway characters... and all are connected in an overarching plot that is slowly drawing them closer together.

TGAB might not appeal to everyone here, but I like it for a few reasons. First, it's a fantastic palate-cleanser if grimdark stories like Worm left you feeling upset. This is pretty much the opposite - yes, the going gets tough and characters face tough challenges and losses, but hardly anyone ever dies. This ties into its major criticism too: because no one ever dies and new characters keep getting added, the character list is ENORMOUS. As such it can be difficult to remember that one character who showed up or was referenced five books ago but is now involved in a later book's plot. The dialogue is also a bit static at the beginning; many characters (especially the non-main characters) all seem to talk the same way. This improves after the first few books, though, so I think it's worth working through. I keep reading it because I love to follow some specific characters (Joseph P. Jenkins and Antonio Darling are the best), but also because I like to see how all the seemingly separate plots intersect with each other. And the worldbuilding is phenomenal!

I also finally, after overlooking it for months, tore through [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student][The Good Student]]. The story follows a boy who excels at one thing: studying. And studying. And studying. As a result of his focus, he attains an incredibly high ranking on his country's national exams, enabling him to enter Ransom Academy, the magical school usually reserved only for the rich and powerful. The story involves investigations into the origin of magic, the nature of beliefs, and the true history of his country. The plot takes a lot of twists and turns later on, where you think you have an answer to what's going on in one chapter just to find it completely overturned one or two chapters later. I liked, but didn't love, the author's previous work - but I'd definitely recommend TGS.

As usual I've kept up with [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] (magical teenager repeats a month over and over trying to discover why while improving his abilities), [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] (a teenager struggling after the death of his best friend finds himself in the fantasy world of Aerb, which seems to be an amalgamation of all the old tabletop campaigns they used to play), and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: Origin of Species]] (a rational/ist take on Pokemon - great worldbuilding and very interesting characters). You'll see all three referenced on this sub quite often.

My final recent read is a... different... type of story than we usually see here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][The Erogamer]]. That's a link to an [[/r/rational]] thread about it, because the Questionable Questing website requires you to create a free account, since the content is undoubtedly NSFW. From the context of those last two sentences you can probably guess the general overview of the story: it's a quest story (ie, the commenters get to select different options to steer the plot) about a girl who wakes up one day as a pornographic game (eroge) character. You may have read quest stories, you may have read Gamer derivatives... but I've personally never read something quite as fascinating as The Erogamer. Its tags are roughly Gamer/eroge/transhumanism/existential horror/lovecraftian sex comedy. Book 2 just ended, and I think there might be a brief break, so now's a great time to start reading and to catch up. I also HIGHLY recommend reading the comments in between chapters as well, because the commentary is very interesting on its own, but also tends to get rolled into the next chapter as well. Oh, and the sex scenes are pretty hot (though they don't occur as frequently as you might imagine).

Outside of reading, I've started listening to the podcast hosted by Daystar Eld (Pokemon: The Origin of Species) and Alexander Wales (Metropolitan Man/Worth the Candle, as cthulhuraejepsen), [[http://alexanderwales.com/rationally-writing/][Rationally Writing]]. Only a few episodes in, but I've been liking it so far - great job, guys! And finally, I read an article or two on Slate Star Codex (by Unsong writer Scott Alexander) that make me think I'll be reading quite a bit more. I enjoyed [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/][The Categories Were Made For Man, Not Man For The Categories]] quite a bit, both for the great critique of transphobic views and for the exceptionally engaging writing style.

Whew... ok, that's all for me. For now, at least!

*Edit: Nope! Forgot one, as I'm still reading it now!*

[[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] was a series I started up a long time ago; I made it to Arc 19 (I think?) before getting caught up, and recently I went back to it... up to Arc 28 now, and the series is on Arc 33. The story is about a teenager sent to a hidden school that trains Heretics - humans endowed with the ability to cast magic and absorb the abilities of the supernatural monsters they are sent to hunt. When I first read the story I thought it was pretty dark and gruesome, with a lot of family trauma and super violent scenes. Now that I'm about 10 arcs further in, it's still pretty dark at times... but also not as bad as I had previously thought. Many of the tragic backstories are somewhat lessened; characters thought dead are often just out of the picture and show back up later. The story very much is moved by plot contrivance, but there are some really good instances of foreshadowing. A lot of seemingly "background" characters often rise to more prominent roles later on. The plot itself is quite fast-paced, with characters often rushing from one emergency situation to the next (sorta like a Dresden Files book). My only issue with the pacing is that you often have 2-3 chapters and then an interlude chapter. The interludes are all interesting, but I usually found myself just wanting to skip ahead to find out what happened to the main story. Other than that, I've really enjoyed rereading the series!

*** The Rationally Writing podcast is awesome. I listened to them all over the past few months, and I really enjoyed it. Not only did it give me a lot of insight into writing, it also gave me a new perspective on the works of [[/u/daystareld][u/daystareld]] and [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]. My favourite episodes were Magic Systems, Power Dynamics, and Tabletop RPGs and Writing. The quality was improving and I felt they were really coming into their own, it's a shame they mostly stopped doing them.

If they see this comment, consider doing an episode on author/fan interaction. (That would make this comment dangerously meta, though)

Isn't quite rational (definitely agreed about plot contrivances), but extremely fun. And an incredibly sweet and rational approach to personal relations, with characters being genre savvy and actually communicating and talking through their issues before they become major problems.

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With This Ring]] is a sane-itization of the DC comic universe. The main character is a self insert, but this is mostly irrelevant to what makes the story so good. In the past I've been loath to recommend it here, as it felt just a bit too much on the popcorn action side of things, but having just finished a multi-week re-read, I find that I can't avoid singing it's praises.

The biggest thing that WtR brings to the DC universe is a much-needed injection of consistency. One of my favorite such interactions is [[#s][minor power spoiler]]. The work is /filled/ with these sorts of clever interactions, mostly spurred on by the main character taking two existing canon DC concepts and putting them together, no real further fiat needed.

Without spoiling too much, the work also follows an alternate-universe version of the MC as he takes a slightly more...villany-looking path. Ever wished someone would just /take care/ of the Joker permanently? He's got you covered. Each major plot point thus comes up and get handled in two very different ways, one MC punching above his weight class through clever abuse of the world's rules, while the other rolls his eyes and puts a bullet wherever it makes sense. Both are quite satisfying to a comics fan for very different reasons. It never quite gets old, either; eventually the two have branched so far that they have quite different equipment, tech, and contacts available, so you never /quite/ know what either is going to do.

The level of writing skill in this work is very impressive to me. Unlike Worm, which has a similar premise and word count and ratchets up the tension every chapter without any real breathing room, WtR knows how to ebb and flow. One arc we'll be in a frightening fight with demons way above our pay grade, and then next we'll take a break for a few chapters and figure out how to use magic portals to replace and fix the London underground. I also like that he fully understands information that /doesn't matter/; links are provided for one-off side character mentions, the plot doesn't concern itself with pointless or repetitive minutia, and all in all I feel like my time is never wasted on any post.

In short, if you like the superhero genre, railguns, banter, or consistent settings, then I can highly recommend With This Ring. It's an ongoing daily (!) post by post serial work that took me about a month to read spending practically every spare moment to read, and it's all so, so good.

*** I ended up dropping the fic when it just veered into even more "staus-quo apologism" (for lack of a better term). Specifically, after the MC got into a fight with green arrow jr. about bow being a terrible choice of weapon for someone with her "peak human" powerset. The narrative then implies that the MC was at fault and he apologizes by making super-arrows.

**** You're remembering correctly, although that event is quite early on. The MC wasn't at fault for hating on "pointy stick launchers" (a view which is only entrenched, expanded, and /vilified/ as the fic goes on), he was at fault for being extremely domineering over it (and taunting her to flash him, behavior which /is/ rather unbecoming of a 30 year old to a teenager). He has to learn not how to get people to change their behavior, but how to persuade them to change what they /want/, and this is a crucial lesson for him to master if he's to make any sort of dent into understanding the orange light.

A big theme of the work is the MC constantly attempting to get everyone to realize what ridiculously overpowered tech is sitting right underneath their noses, which early on is mostly him trying convince Badass Normals to upgrade. If I was in English class I would classify this as a Man vs Insane World sort of work, where the MC must attempt to defy the conventions that everyone else is happy to live with. This is definitely a deconstruction of DC, so any perceived apologism is more likely to be setting the stage.

I would recommend giving it another go, at /least/ until the Ophidian is introduced, at which point this specific concern begins to be addressed in earnest.

I think the author tries to reconstruct the DC universe even as their main character SI tries to exploit it, so the authors goes into worldbuilding to try to make sense of the world and avoid a curbstomp on the SI's part.

The specific example you are complaining about, is, as ketura said, a case where the MC SI was being a jerk, even if they were mostly right.

** I recommend two fantasy books this month.

1) [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35530652-grey-sister][Grey Sister]] by Mark Lawrence, the sequel to [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Red Sister]], which I thought was the best fantasy book of last year. Here's the rec I wrote for red sister last year:

#+begin_quote
  I finished reading Red Sister and I really enjoyed it. The setting was possibly the best part for me. It's set in a ice world which was colonized by four different "races" of humanity, each with their own magical/physical ability. With the aid of a solar mirror their ancestors were able to create a corridor of suitably temperate weather around the equator. The rest of the world is basically just glaciers that are constantly encroaching on this shrinking corridor. The knowledge that the mirror has been slowly falling out of its orbit and that the death of everyone on the planet is inevitable is widespread.
#+end_quote

2) [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35437058-master-assassins][Master Assassins]] by Robert V.S. Redick. Don't mind the title or the stupid cover. The book is not an action story, it is not about "master assassins". It's a story of two brothers that get caught up in events way out of their league. They're part of a persecuted ethnicity that has only recently started fighting back, under the leadership of an extremely brutal theocracy governed by a still living prophet. What I really like about the book is the characterization of the protagonist and his companions, and the protagonist's relationship with his brother.

** This season of the Magicians was superb ([[#s][spoilers]]). In general, I've really liked the show, particularly for the pop-culture references, and the way the show approaches the wish-fulfillment/coming of age fantasy it's clearly responding to (particularly Harry Potter and Narnia).

I also had fun with the new season of the Santa Clarita Diet. I think the comedy has improved from the first season -- in particular, I think Timothy Olyphant is carrying the show less than he was in the first season.

Have I recommended /The Fifth Season/ trilogy here? Because those books are good, and are also quite refreshingly different from a lot of other fantasy.

I've read through the first three books of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center_Saga][Galactic Center Saga]] so far, and definitely recommend it. There are definitely some weird bits (Bigfoot showing up in the first book, the machine art in the third book), but overall I've liked them so far.

Speaking of weird, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_(novel)][Light]] by M. John Harrison is really weird, but also fascinating and very good. I haven't started on the sequels yet, but I think this book is definitely worth it for any fans of science fiction.

Finally, I just got [[https://www.amazon.com/Grey-Sister-Book-Ancestor-Lawrence/dp/1101988886][Grey Sister]] yesterday, and though I haven't finished it yet, so far it's been just as good as the rest of Lawrence's stuff.

The ending of the first book, in particular, and the fact that [[#s][spoilers for the first book]]

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond.45951/][Even Further Beyond]] is a nice quest on SV that seems pretty rational so far IMO. The premise is that the main character is a human from the ordinary world who, in the afterlife, is commanded by the divinities to reincarnate into a Xianxia-inspired setting and defeat the Heroine, a reincarnated goddess who will bring about the end of the Age of the setting. If he succeeds, the divinities will grant him a wish, and if he fails then he will be given some unspecified punishment. There's a lot of min-maxing involved in how he can develop his magic abilities.

*** This may sound a bit pedantic, but is the min-maxing actually any good? Usually when I see these kinds of "use an original magic system to become more powerful" kinds of tales, the actual optimization is just a bunch of obvious low-hanging fruit and not actually inventive or impressive. I much prefer the kinds of characters with outlandish combinations of unexpected abilities to create /overwhelmingly/ powerful synergies. Basically, the "max" is never all that high for me.

Like, Pathfinder allows for a character build which converts alcohol into angel summons, and makes for a defensive powerhouse as well. It's a four-step chain of mutating character resources that transforms consumed beer into myriad celestial allies, and it's /totally unlike/ the sorts of things you usually see in a game which supposedly supports "min-maxing".

I think Rihaku (the author) is pretty cognizant of most methods of gaming the system so players haven't really come across anything truly inspiring. It's more the main character who acts rationally using his abilities. But it is still fun to read, and there isn't much of a ceiling to the level of power that can be reached.

**** I feel that there is a difference in terms here. To me, min-maxing refers to ensuring that your stats and abilities match your character ideal. To use D&D as an example, this would be lowering your Wizard's strength to boost their intelligence.

To me, you are referring to munchkining. As I understand, munchkining refers to using the rules in a way that was not originally intended by the designers, usually to be more effective than usual.

** I've been absolutely obsessed with [[https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][Zombie Knight]] for the last few weeks. I saw it from a thread on here and was hooked fast, so I recommend going in sight-unseen, but it's a sort-of-fantasy, sort-of-superhero story that comes bleedingly close to being a ratfic. The only thing that I think holds it back is that the world has some ill-defined rules, but some of that could be explained away by [[#s][minor spoilers]]. Also, it's very much a soft system rather than hard, with most of the rules being pretty nebulous.

The other thing I wanna give a shout-out to is 3-gatsu no lion, or March Comes in like a Lion (it's on Crunchy Roll, but I'm at work so I don't wanna link it). It's a slice of life anime about a high school boy that's really good at shogi, and the first season is just like putting some hand warmers around your heart. But the second season (which just wrapped up) goes so much further. Really high quality animation and the characters are /so good/. Seriously, it's some of the best characterization I've ever seen - no characters being dumb because it's on their bullet list of traits, everyone's just trying their best, and the world feels very real (well, it is real, but you know what i mean).

**** Thanks for asking. I didn't have time to write a description when I first posted this. It is violent but not as much as that description suggests, and her stated goal isn't static nor straight forward. The story is not revenge porn. Despite the violence I find the tone light-hearted.

It's a fantasy setting with magic, but the magic is researched somewhat scientifically. This is not a big part of the story though, or rather it is important to the story but it's more in the background.

What I like about it the characters have their own motivations that are reasonable and consistent. Basically no idiot balls, though their use of magic/technology seems far from optimized. The main character's naivety is endearing, but she is not 'good'. I also really like the world building, which is revealed to the reader at a good pace. The author combines ideas in a simple but engaging way. There may be other reasons that I can't identify.

The author updates pretty regularly once per week, but she(?) is writing two stories at once so there are gaps of several weeks while she writes Trials.

** I watched all of /Legion/ in this last week or so; it's amazing. Definitely one of my favorite shows of all time.

A decent snarky summary is: "Hey you're crazy!" "No, you're not crazy, you're a telepath!" "Wait! You're both a telepath, AND crazy!" "Wait, that's not a--- !"

Things that stand out to me are:

- the character depths (in all characters, but particularly the main character)
- the range of acting they all get to do (there's a scene where actor does their normal "american" accent, an amazing british accent, and then a /bad/ british accent)
- the cinematography (it's not quite as pretty as American Gods, but close)
- the pacing: It never really slows down, but has 3-4 to-black cuts (for a few seconds) in an episode, which are rarely (if ever) cliffhangers. It's full of easy, natural stopping points, so I felt zero pressure to binge.

I wouldn't call it "rational", but I would call it /amazing/.

*** I've found that while *GURPS* is able to do a lot of things fairly well, it doesn't do as well at evoking theme as a set of mechanics designed for the purpose, since the mechanics shape how you approach and play the game. Using a set of generic mechanics therefore means that you lose some of the "fit" between mechanics and story.

Games like *Apocalypse World* or *Shadowrun* or even *Dungeons & Dragons* are very much set up to generate a particular play experience; they will probably do better at that particular story or genre than any generic system, having been made from the ground up for that purpose.

That said, GURPS is extremely useful precisely because there's such a range and wealth of supplements available, and for an idea where there doesn't exist any system that fits the idea it can be great.

*** This is one of my fav RPGs: [[http://suffadv.wikidot.com/]]

I'm a little biased being familiar with the people that wrote it and having contributed to the expansion.

The basic idea is that a long time ago, someone made an achronal artificial intelligence. They left humanity with some cool future tech (nanotech, psychohistory, wormholes) and buggered off for awhile. Now it's the future, the civilizations are cored around deep cultural beliefs rather than geography, and the AIs are back... to run the patent office.

You play "patent officers". But, since your bosses can do something approximating "see the future", you really just get sent interest places to do interesting things; usually weird moral dillemas around technology that would explode or go unnoticed had you not been sent.

Mechanically, the most interesting part is that you, as the player, have plot abilities (balanced against your character abilities); the space amish have amazing plot abilities, the living starships have very little. It works /really/ well.

** [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun][Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun]] is one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. It's up there with Ouran High School Host Club as a fantastic parody of shojo romance manga, but without an overarching plot or character development. The fact that it's /just/ a high school comedy shouldn't dissuade you though, it's freaking hilarious and the best adaption of 4-koma jokes I've seen yet. I'm definitely checking out the manga to get more of it.

I won't spoil what the show is about, it's actually better to go in blind and discover the characters for yourself. They all fall into traditional archetypes, but subvert them in significant ways that satirize both shojo romance and traditional gender roles. I think that's what elevates the show beyond /just/ a parody of romantic plots driven by misunderstandings where the joke is that everyone is smart enough to figure out other people's problems but oblivious to their own, though that's still enough to carry the comedy.

There's also some great jokes about how manga gets made and how the life of the writer often revolves around their creative process. I love the meta-humor about how the mangaka turns all of his friends into romance stories while being utterly oblivious to the actual romance story he's in that never advances. The situation is contrived as all hell, but the absurdity of it just makes it funnier. If you have ever liked a romantic comedy anime, you've got to check this out.

** Been listening to the audio book of Jo Waltons the just city, which is about Athena recruiting classics scholars from across time to attempt to build Platos Republic. This goes about as well as you would expect, but watching everyone try their very hardest to build a scholarly utopia is just amazing. Bought the sequels as soon as I finished, and am hoping the quality will hold up.

Worth the candle is very good.

****** He's saying that Worth the Candle is so good that it's torture to wait for the next chapter to be released. So he recommends waiting until it's complete before reading it. Also the previous post is him stating in an extremely abbreviated way "waiting to read it is not the same thing as recommending to not read it".

*** Hulu's got "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" (Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie when they were younger, doing sketch comedy) and "Blackadder" (four seasons all staring Rowan Atkinson, it's just a funny pseudohistorical sitcom with each season set in a different historical period; season two adds Stephen Fry and seasons three and four add Hugh Laurie).

Neither of those is rational in any sense, but they're funny.

*** Jane the Virgin - it's a comedy and it's hilarious. It's in the style of a telenovella. Synopsis: a woman who is saving herself for marriage accidentally gets artificially inseminated. It suffers a lot from Hollywood Medicine and Hollywood Police work. My reason for recommending it in [[/r/rational]] is that the /relationships/ are handled very rationally: people talk about their problems to each other and handle disagreements maturely for the most part, which is very unusual for the genre.

Sense8 - it's just amazing. Watch it. It's by the Wachowskis. Not Rational but still really cool. Episode 4 is where it hits its stride. It's a cool scifi premise but also "what if there were 8 really good drama shows happening simultaneously and crossing over?". Amazing characters, including the 8 main characters and the supporting cast. It was cancelled but the outrage about the cliffhanger was so huge that a special finale episode has been ordered and should be released in a few months. If the finale special does well, who knows, Season 3 might even be on the cards.

The Handmaid's Tale - On hulu. Based on the Atwood novel. Amazing adaptation that is faithful to the novel but expands on it amazingly. Really dark.
