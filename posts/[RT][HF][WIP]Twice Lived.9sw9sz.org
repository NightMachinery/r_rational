As people seem to be suggesting series from Royal Road lately, I feel like I should make a recommendation of my own that I have been considering recommending for awhile.

The story [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19827/twice-lived]['Twice Lived' by Obran]] is one I think you all might enjoy, it's main character is interesting and enjoyable despite being put into a thoroughly horrible situation, he considers his situation in detail and acts with forethought.

The magic is interesting and well explained, though we are still waiting for explanation of a few of the MC's abilities. The world itself is something that I find very immersive and well thought out.

I enjoy the authors take on the Isekai trope of never telling anyone your origins, because in most stories where the MC thinks this, it wouldn't matter at all if he told anyone, especially friends, but in this story it is CRUCIAL that no one finds out.

The author has made it clear that this is very much a draft and will be edited extensively in the future (though it is already considerably clean in my opinion), so if you are alright with that then I think you should definitely give it a shot.


** I read it for a while, but between the clumsy references, the relentless gory nihilism, and the clumsy word choice I just lost interest. It's good enough to suck you in - decent grammar, okay characterization - but no aspect rises above "meh" in the firsr bit. Like, if you disliked Worm, this has all the things people cite as turning them off of it, but multiplied to a level even I can't stand. And look at my username.

*** I completely agree.

Additionally I found the MC to be thoroughly dislikable, both due to his character and his agonizing stupidity.

Not to mention that the author appears to have memory problems, since he keeps contradicting thing that he established in earlier chapters.

His mother, for example. In the three chapters that she is mentioned she gets three different characterizations. And the number of times that he has met her in his life keeps going down.

** I do love the bait & switch. He originally named it "Standard reincarnation story" and it couldn't be further from the truth. The whole story seems professional to me.
