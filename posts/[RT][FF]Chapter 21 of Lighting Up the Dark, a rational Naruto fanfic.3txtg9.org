At least this Orochimaru will do something interesting and useful with it, instead of pointlessly running around trying to find new people to take revenge on.

Inexplicable authorial aversion to overwhelming firepower. It's the whole "a proper ninja must be sneaky and backstabby" thing, which somehow manages to miss the fact that Narutoverse "ninja" are not medieval Japanese peasants, but wizardly warrior-gods. The in-story justification boils down to grinding the base stats first before applying power-multipliers, which smells of bullshit, because possession of power-multipliers doesn't lock Rei out of grinding her stats. Happily, everyone who tries to sell her that bullshit has actual reasons to want Rei to remain as weak as possible for as long as possible, so it's not that jarring to read.

I don't expect to see much more of this, actually. Both SB and SV flip out at anything even very remotely resembling sexuality for some reason.

******** Generally it's one DM and then all the posters are in control of one character. The GM usually gives a couple options for each major dialogue or action, and sometimes allows posters to write-in what they want. There's voting for each choice, and if necessary a roll to determine how well the action was done.

That's basically it. For a multi-GM quest, I was proposing that you have each GM run the major characters in the background while the main character is doing their thing, but realized that most of the people they would be running in a Naruto-themed quest would be generally fairly powerful, both personally and politically, allowing the GM's full rein to blow holes in the setting from behind the scenes while the main character would be run by a bunch of posters, who are generally more inclined to starting lesbian relationships and arguing with each other.

I'd be willing to try it, with the proviso that the posts would likely be pretty short to start and I might need to bail out if it ends up taking too much time. If I were doing it on my own I'd set it in the Team_Anko-verse -- it could be a fun way to explore the Republic/Elemental Nations conflict. Although, if other GMs are chiming in we'd probably want to do something different, since locking them into my sandbox seems rude.

************** Holy shit, sudden responsibility, time to run and hide!

Once you guys decide what interpretation of universe you're going to be running the quest in (at least the bare basics as far as tech-levels and the approximate mechanism behind chakra magic go) we can leave the rest to players. Basically, you can just let everyone choose what character and location they want to start with. I'd suggest giving a couple default options and a write-in a-la:

1. [] You're an orphan. You were just rescued from a burning orphanage by mysterious [[#s][snake-like gentleman]].

2. [] You're a boring person who didn't choose option one. You'll be playing as some nameless genin mook of a minor village in the arse end of nowhere.

3. [] Write-in

The traditional way to run a quest is to basically go with the most popular option the players choose (first-past-the-post style). If we're going for a rational-ish Naruto, this may be a bad idea, because everyone will go for a shiny sooner or later and the quest will end in blood and tears. Some people have restricted voting only to a select list of reasonable people, some do not care about the votes, but choose the option with the best presented reasoning and so on. You (we? should I be the designated "takes care of background technical stuff" person for this quest?) should probably decide beforehand what kind of write-in and voting system we're going for and tell the players immediately.

Then we have the game mechanics side of questing. Basically, are you going to be doing skill checks when players decide to try something with uncertain chances of success? For reasons of stupid-monkeyness, giving the players a chance to determine the fate of the character via calls to rng really improves the satisfaction people derive from participating in quests, so you might want to do it. In that case, we should decide what style of system we should go with: there is classic DnD style of opposed checks, there is new and old World of Darkness dicepool stuff, we might actually want some simple homebrew system that's just better.

tl;dr There is technical stuff to figure out first, if we want to run the quest properly. Of course, dealing with this may be just the trivial inconvenience that kills your motivation to run the quest before you can even begin, in which case --- fuck it, write the intro the way you want it and we will figure out the exiting (to me) stuff, such as game mechanics, later.

Yep. Figure it out, call me when it's time to start writing -- I offer you total trust and leave it all in your hands.

[[/u/Velorien]]:

- If you want to weigh in on the fiddly bits, talk to [[/u/AugSphere]]. I'm fine with whatever you guys come up with.
- If you want to write the kickoff that's cool, otherwise I'll do it. [[/u/AugSphere]], please talk to Velorien and get his answer. Once the mechanics are worked out, ping whichever one of us is writing the kickoff.

EDIT: As to worldbuilding, my suggestions would be:

- Tech level of medieval Japan. No cell phones or other electronics. Maybe electricity is being experimented with, but it's still at a Leyden jar stage.
- Med-nin understand anatomy at a gross level -- down to the level you can see with a low-power optical microscope -- but do not know DNA exists. Orochimaru and a few other experts might. Note that the Byakugan canonically allows seeing everything down to the size of a dust mite (~ 0.25 mm)
- Seals are a thing and are used to run chakra-based technology. (Refrigerators, ovens, etc) A seal requires that the design be perfect and then a certain amount of chakra be added in order to activate it, but you don't have to add it all at once. Civilians have very low chakra reserves so it takes a long time to energize anything other than a very basic seal. Retired ninja can make good money selling the things, just because they can produce them faster than a civvie.
- Konoha is the largest village, with a population described below. Other major ninja villages are roughly the power level.
- There are multiple ninja school, some better than others. The Academy is the best. (Think Princeton or Oxford, with school quality trailing down to 'no-name diploma mill'.)

The Byakugan is an utter pain in the ass to write because it's so overpowered. I suggest the following definitions, most of which are canon:

- Infrared through UV
- Sees chakra, can identify individual people / animals / seals by their chakra
- Down to 0.25mm resolution
- Range of 50m for genin (e.g. Hinata at Wave Arc) up to 10km for Hiashi
- There's a 5 degree cone out the back of your neck that you can't see. (In canon it's smaller and variable.) Define this as: take the normal of your C4 vertebrae, draw a series of lines at 2.5 degrees off from that normal.
- Has one or more points of focus that they see absolutely everything in, including the insides of objects. Everything else in range is seen as clearly as a normal person sees in the arc 45 degrees off center. (Motion, color, approximate shape, no fine details.) Most users have 1 point of focus that is a sphere ~2m across. Skilled users have multiple and/or larger points of focus.
- Students start school (ninja or civilian) at 6 and go to school for 8 years, so graduates (ninja or civilian) are ~14. Higher education is available for civilians after graduation. Ninja students learn reading, writing, and basic math (up through algebra), but are lacking most civilian education and rarely pursue it further as they have more survival-critical skills to train.\\

Konoha:

- Total population w/civilians: ~50,000
- Hokage: 1 (Hiruzen Sarutobi as at start of Wave Arc)
- Elite jonin (Kakashi, Gai, Anko, etc): 30
- Other jonin (including special jonin): 100
- Chunin: 400
- Genin: 1600
- Itachi is gone, the Massacre is over, Danzo / Kakashi / Sasuke are the only Sharingan users in Konoha.\\
- They do more civilian missions (irrigation, wall-building) than military ones -- the money isn't as good but there are more of them and they don't risk valuable assets.

This is 1:25 tooth-to-tail ratio, which is low even for a medieval army so I think it works for a militarized city.

Rules:

- Players are not, I repeat *NOT*, allowed to have a Sharingan or a friendly bijuu inside them, although they can have an unfriendly one.\\
- There can be jinchuriki of non-bijuu if people want to do that. Minor animal or nature spirit, ancestor, etc.
- Players who want to be ninja start as genin.

If we want to do chakra budgeting, I have formulas. They are intentionally fairly restrictive, but could easily be opened up. Also, I would say we should standardizs the henge -- is it physical, illusion, or can it be either at wearer's choice? This is important to determine what happens when someone henges into an object as opposed to s person.

****************** We'll probably want to budget chakra inside the game-mechanics stuff.

A simple system that comes to mind is to use dice to represent chakra. So let's say a character has 5 chakra dice and decides to give his taijutsu some additional juice. Suppose he's facing a pretty tough opponent and normally he would have about 20% chance of successful taijutsu engagement (for example one of the players rolls a d100 and has to beat 80). If the players decide that he's enhancing his fighting using chakra, then we'd allow someone to roll additional dice. Then we could take the higher roll of two as a final result. That pushes the probability of success to 36%. If players want to dump even more effort into it, then we allow them to roll one more dice and again take the highest roll. This pushes it to 49%, and so on.

We could make techniques cost some flat start-up amount, like, for example, 4 dice to cast shadow clone jutsu (creating just one clone), and give additional effects for more dice, like a second clone for 3 more dice.

This system has an advantage of being really simple, but the disadvantage that the effects of additional dice are not diminishing, but rather exponentially increasing. So picking one high-risk, high-reward gambit and dumping all the chakra dice into it will be the optimal strategy. Not sure how representative that is of typical Naruto combat.

#+end_quote

No-one is really keen on the canon idiot. The rational ones are simply fabulous.

EDIT2: Well, the dice don't actually stack exponentially, the pmf just changes from linear to quadratic and so on. The actual success probabilities go as

| Dice | Success probability |
|------+---------------------|
| 1    | 0.2                 |
| 2    | 0.36                |
| 3    | 0.488               |
| 4    | 0.5904              |
| 5    | 0.6723              |
| 6    | 0.7379              |
| 7    | 0.7903              |
| 8    | 0.8322              |
| 9    | 0.8658              |
| 10   | 0.8926              |

Which is more or less reasonable as far as diminishing returns go. So, turns out that the simple system is actually pretty good.

Do we allow them to buy dice on top of jutsu? Suppose a player says, "I'm gonna use a fireball for X dice, but I really, really want it to hit, so I'm gonna pump some Y chakra into my legs and position myself properly while doing the hand jive". Then we have him cast the jutsu for X normally, but add extra Y (or Y/2, or whatever going rate we decide on) dice to his attempt to hit with it.

As an aside, do we really need the blind spot for byakugan? It always bugged me, because it was an obvious ugly hack added for the sake of a single fight in canon. Just toss it out, I say. Otherwise all the Hyūga will just constantly fidget around and no other difference will be apparent, but it'll bug me to no end. Compared to the other magic eyes byakugan has a pretty low power ceiling anyway.

Also, what kind of power curve are we going for?

If something similar were to happen during the game, the players should get a choice of roughly what they get to learn, within reason. Perhaps the choice could be something like this:

*Learn a technique to help with evasion and escape

*Learn a technique that helps in close-quarters combat

*Practice one of your old techniques and see if you can master a new application of that technique.

*Work with your team-mates to develop some kind of combination-attack.

*Rest well to be in top shape for the next fight.

**************************** Look at all the S-class people in Naruto: they all have pretty damn huge advantages over the run-of-the-mill shinobi. If we're making the universe rational, then we can draw an implication from that. The player character is not going to be the only ninja to crave power, but the only one to actually achieve serious power-levels without cheats was Hiruzen. We know that the low-hanging fruit isn't enough to become S-class.

Now, on one hand, we might as well use this to make things interesting and give players a perfectly ordinary person to start with. See how long it takes them to bootstrap their way to godhood without some bloodline shortcut.

On the other, we may want to allow people to pick a truly powerful advantage, but make sure they need it by making the antagonists truly challenging. Not to mention that some problems are just not solvable via sufficient firepower. If your goal is to make elemental nations into a peaceful paradise, then your enemy will be the mentality of the people. Can't exactly punch that out.

I'd go for making the antagonists truly powerful, giving people a starting character without any advantages over a median genin, but allowing the players comparatively full freedom to optimise as they see fit, including the ridiculous power-multiplier things like Edo Tensei and stealing some Sharingan from somewhere. We can manage to keep things challenging without forcing people onto the underpowered-jutsu rails.

******************************* Hm, actually, a handful of missing-nin trying to build a new village sounds really appealing. Maybe it's a couple of jonin, a handful of chunin, and a bunch of genin, and they need to attract some other ninja and a lot of civilians to do the farming and such. Could be survivors of another village, but I prefer the idea that one chunin missing-nin with only moderate ninja-power but excellent charisma went around convincing other missing-nin to band together and join up. The chunin is in charge, even though the jonin outrank him / her.

Reasons why daimyo might be in power:

- The Daimyos and Kages are co-rulers, with the Daimyo handling the civilian side and the ninja handling the military. Both of them are aware that the Daimyo is dead any time the Kage wants him to be, so the daimyo is second fiddle.
- Same as above, but there is a widely-held belief that the military should be subordinate to the civilian side (e.g. America, every other decent nation on earth) and everyone buys into it.
- Samurai are basically ninja with low chakra reserves. In a fair fight they are not a one-on-one match, but there are a lot more of them.
- The ninja have tried taking things over in the past, but the people don't want to be ruled by ninja. Military resistance doesn't work, but passive resistance does -- farmers don't farm efficiently, merchants don't merchant efficiently, etc. The ninja can make people do things by standing over them, but there aren't enough of them to do that. Given the fatalist view of the population, punishment raids are not effective. There are some collaborators, but in general it's just easier for the ninja to be a detached military force whom the civilians are happy to work with.

The problem with that argument is one of delegation. Let's treat the daimyo as a supreme ruler in a feudal system for a second. There is no way the very top of feudal power hierarchy would refuse to serve a ninja, they are just too few and too easy to hunt down. Holding their families hostage would be trivial for ninjas as well. So we have a ninja at the top. That kind of reasoning gives us at least a couple of top levels of a hierarchy in the hands of ninja (perhaps retired ones, who still crave power), with the lower levels, who handle the actual interactions with peasants, being vanilla mortals. Would peasants really care about who their daimyo is, even if they still deal with the same people? I think not. At least not enough to slack off more than they already do. Plus, I've never actually got a sense that ninja have any scarcity, at least as far as shelter and food go. There are few enough of them that they could comfortably tax a small number of civilians and live carefree lives of routine murder.

Should the daimyo just be subordinates who deal with the administration of civilian population without any ability to order ninja around? I doubt any shinobi would find that kind of work terribly appealing, so a trusted civilian would naturally fill the position. Remote areas away from big ninja villages could have their own governance structures of course.

************************* Let me be a voice of dissent on this. We're targeting [[/r/rational]] audience with this, people will crave optimisation. And people *know* that some techniques are miles ahead of others in usefulness. We could make their sensei an asshole, who refuses to let them know the specifics of what he'll teach them, or something, but that would simply be an obstacle to be overcome on the path to power. Sooner or later people will manoeuvre the character into a position, where there is no justification to deny them full information about what they could learn other than 'DM fiat'. Just outright taking the ability of players to choose optimal path of development is huge dick move. If we're gonna restrict players that much, might as well give up on the whole quest and just write a collaboration fanfic.

That said, we probably shouldn't just allow people to freely use their meta knowledge. If they don't know about the specifics of shadow clone technique in-character, then there will be no reason for them to obsessively try to acquire the technique and we could disallow it.

In short, attempts to curb power levelling should be done via controlling the information the character has, or just by making the world hostile and not at all obliging to power-levelling. If the players have invested in-character time to look for specifics of some technique, we may as well let them have it.

My answer would probably be very different in four to five months (I'm taking a sabbatical year or two around then if I can get away with it), but I can't right now.

The sporadic writing time I do these days generally goes towards IFF. Even that isn't much, at the time. (Yes, I still work on it. No, it's not abandoned, and it won't be. It'll just take... time. Life keeps me busy. Sorry.)

Anyways, for what my opinion is worth, I'd agree with regards to not putting it in any one author's own universe.

I'd have a similar impulse to setting it within the IFF-verse, because I know the rules there and have spent ages trying to make them consistent. It's very different from your 'verse, though, and most of the other rationalist takes on Naruto I've seen. I'd also necessarily have to divulge some pretty heavy world-building spoilers.

Regardless of whether you guys are going to go ahead with this before my own completely unreasonably long (and unreasonably uncertain) time schedule of basically half a year, then I'd suggest some proper rational and well-defined setting is found that doesn't have a cornucopia of easily exploitable powers defined as an integral part of canon (I'm looking at you, Naruto).

Perhaps a shared creation would be interesting. Even the idea of a shared Naruto-verse might have some strong merits. We've all spent a very long time thinking about how to have that make sense and not break down instantly, after all.

** Ok, take this:

- Fact: Bijuu are supercomputing killing machines.
- Fact: In canon, the Sharingan can control the Bijuu.
- Fact: One of the most badass ninja in the world is asking a twelve year old for help.
- Fact: said twelve year old is the only accessible Sharingan user.

Hipothesis-1: Like in canon, the Sharingan has the possibility to control the Bijuu.

Hipothesis-2: Seeing the recurring AI theme of rational fiction, my idea is that the Sharingan has the power to forcfully update the Bijuu/AI optimization preferences.

  I do not view myself as evil, my dear Sasuke. It is not something people often do. I have seen the face of true evil -- Akatsuki contained little else -- and the crucial difference is in one's motivations. Mine have only ever been humanitarian.

** So, I don't think there is any evidence to trust Orochimaru, and this kinda holds true for any rational naruto fanfic. This does have some assumptions, mainly two: 1. Orochimaru in your rational fanfic is rational himself, and is actually really good at it. 2. We don't know what Orochimaru knows.

Here's the problem. The reassurances that Orochimaru in this fanfiction, and many others, boils down to: "I could use force, but I am not, therefore, believe that I am being honest." And that's fine, and that's true, but it also means nothing because, just like we are looking at this conversation from, in this fanfiction, Sasuke's view, and going, "well that seems reasonable", no one is looking at Orochimaru's view.

Here is what I assume Orochimaru is thinking, "If I can convince this kid, with only words and no hard evidence, to do what I want willingly, that's great. If he offers any resistance though, I will go with my well thought out and personally well-liked plan of brainwashing this motherfucker."

Like, to me, any evidence we assume showing that Orochimaru is being "truthful" or "nice" or "makes sense" is just as easily evidence for Orochimaru being smart and wanting to manipulate people into being willing allies, which is pretty much always better than having to spend time and resources brainwashing, forcing, or manipulating on some more obvious level.

At this point, without really knowing anything about Orochimaru (we all have a bunch of assumptions from the manga) we really KNOW nothing, nothing at all. We have no information, at all.

*** I think there's another layer to it, which is "I have all of the information and have thought about this much more than you have, so I could almost certainly manipulate you into believing whatever I want. Therefore, you may as well just take my word for this and save yourself the wasted effort of trying to second-guess me. Either I'm lying, and you'll never figure it out, or I'm telling the truth, and you're wasting your time trying to figure it out."

** I wonder if this could be one big fake-out to test Sasuke's loyalty to Leaf. I wouldn't put it past Danzō or Hiruzen to make some Yamanaka mind-read blackmail material from leaf grunts and have Anko impersonate Orochimaru. In any case, all of this ought to be much easier to organise for Leaf leadership than for Oro-tan, unless he's extremely competent (in which case, why isn't he already ruling the elemental nations?).

** Just the fact that the deal requires betraying his country is Bayseian evidence that the deal is bad, since villains would frequently want people to betray their country and actual beneficial plans would be no more likely to contain the feature of betraying one's country than any other feature. Likewise, the fact that Orochimaru is giving him seriously incomplete information about the plan is Bayseian evidence that Orochimaru is trying to deceive him, even though it's possible that genuinely good plans cannot be revealed. Also the fact that he can't safely talk about the plan to anyone else.

Also, plans which too conveniently fit with one's predilections are Bayseian evidence for the plan being bad, for similar reasons. (See also [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jao/siren_worlds_and_the_perils_of_overoptimised/%5D][this]], where a plan that fits with one's predilections would be equivalent to a marketing world.)

And his statement that evil consists of having a bad motivation is a seriously incomplete description of evil. If your motivation is to kill all Jews, you're evil, but what if your motivation is just to help all Aryans, and killing the Jews just falls out of your plan rather than being your actual motivation? And whether something is a motivation is partly arbitrary, anyway--for instance, you could argue that in the latter example, killing Jews is in fact a motivation.

   Simply transferring to Orochimaru is impossible, so generally Sasuke would have to defect to get some optimal training. That is pretty much true regardless of Oro's intentions, hence weak evidence.

   That's a bit more concerning, but what could he actually tell him? The fact that his eyes could be used to control the bijū. But he could have just as well avoided telling him because he doesn't want Sasuke to give himself away and is otherwise acting in good faith. Not getting Sasuke put under guard would be a goal regardless. Again weak.

It may be simultaneously true that 1) what Orochimaru told him is evidence for the deal being bad, and 2) the deal is actually good and Orochimaru couldn't have told him anything better.

Then Orochimaru would simply have gotten very unlucky--by pure chance this good deal looks very much like a bad one from the outside. And it would still be logical for Sasuke to treat it as a bad deal; Sasuke would just be unlucky in that he is turning down a good deal that has a lot of evidence for it being bad.

We're probably just misunderstanding each other, but Bayessian evidence exists when there is a difference in some indicator depending on some fact. In other words, if Orochimaru couldn't have done anything differently, even if he was being honest, then what he did constitutes no evidence towards his dishonesty.

That's the fate of all non-omniscient beings. It's on Orochimaru to present enough guarantees of trustworthiness that the prior suspicion is overcome. I would like Sasuke to take the deal, because I predict I'll enjoy that development more that the alternatives. But I'm not sure I'd take it, if I were Sasuke (but then, I'm not a revenge-obsessed idiot, so what would I know?).

Sasuke might not necessarily be aware that Orochimaru couldn't have done anything differently. Based on Sasuke's limited knowledge, the fact that the deal has many features common to scams is Bayseian evidence that it is a scam, even if it would not be such evidence if Sasuke had full knowledge.

******* Ah, finally got ya. Yes, from his point of view the deal doesn't look so hot, I agree. But then, his alternative of staying in Konoha isn't that great either. The only thing he has is Naruto going "it's gonna be good, trust me". So far the village didn't do much to help with the revenge thing.
