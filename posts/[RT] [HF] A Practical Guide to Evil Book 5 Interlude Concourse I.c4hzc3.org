** Remember how Cat and Cordelia were discussing the drawbacks of having to answer to the Highest Assembly, and why she didn't take the opportunity to become an absolute ruler after the Proceran civil war? And Cat pointed out that most of her opposition was in the army passing through the Stairway? Looks like Cordelia finally gave in to the temptation, in light of the Dead King invading.

***** " /Dredge it out/, she wrote. /Prepare it. Fire against fire./ The Augur had found a path through, narrow as it was, and it began with a corpse that was not a corpse beneath the waters of the lake at the heart of Procer. The Ashurans, it was said, had called on a masked and hallowed presence at the Battle of Thalassina. Cordelia Hasenbach would call on a lot worse if she had to. " This is in the prologue of book 5

and it's referred to again more recently as one of the few times that Angels had died and that one of the remains was in Procer. But i'm not exactly sure when.

******* We don't know for sure if it's an angel or not. We know Triumphant was particularly brutal with the tribes around Lake Artoise, and we know she killed an angel, but we don't know if she killed an angel at Lake Artoise or not. I still think it's a Hell Egg.

*** I wonder if she had already planned for this before she knew about the seven Princes that had lost their Princehood? I mean Cat was aware of the need to keep Cordelia's enemies in the Highest assembly alive and hampering her, but was Cordelia planning on this from the start or was she driven to this extreme by the loss of her home Province?

In all fairness what she was doing was more or less within the written rules while violating the spirit of them, or more bluntly before if she got a number of Prince's killed/removed whoever followed them would have been aware that she got their relatives killed for power, and might have made her support less confident in her.

Man it would be pretty funny if at some point the land that Cordelia is Prince of was invalidated by oh i dunno it's complete destruction and that that invalidates her claim to the title of Prince which then invalidates her ability to be the First Prince?

Also:

  “In that spirit, Princess Rozala Malanza, as commander of the Principate's southern armies I charge you with the preservation of Queen Catherine Foundling's life and the safeguard of her armies and associates. Should the Dominion strike at her, you are to take any measures short of open war with Levant to prevent conflict reigniting between Callow and the Grand Alliance.”

*** I actually cackled at that. Just like, "holy shit, they can learn!" I can just imagine Cordelia's though process as she tries to explain it to everyone:

"Sorry, but that person we pissed away 30,000 men trying to slaughter, and then beat up all our heroes, and then we denounced as the anti-christ over the actual demon summoner who allied with the Dead King, and then counter-invaded us, and then countered our counter attack with Evil elves and an actual god sworn to Below literally following her around and declaring her their high priest, and then fought off the entire grand alliance including our battalion of heroes a second time, both times trying to minimize /our/ casualties, and then dethroned a third of Procer?

We should probably stop fucking with her."

** Man i wasn't even thinking about the potential theological issues of heresy in a world that has explicitly God given powers, man how bad would it be for them all if suddenly they had no priestly healing? And in the same view of the Gods Below taking back the Name of Black Knight previously?

I do really like Arnauld even if he's definitely not the most charismatic there's something to be said to his loyalty to Procer over any single person, I really want to see his response to The First Prince's decision to drudge up an Angel corpse. Also that Cordelia's been pushed to the point of survival over anything else rather than keeping her previous prejudices against Cat.

Also that while many a Prince lost their title and metaphorical crown that we might not have seen the so called Princes Graveyard yet. emphasis on the yet.

** Keeping the Gave of Princes heirs from inheriting is going to be a very bad look. After all, these are people who sacrificed their crowns for the war effort. And now they're suffering politically for it. Even if they win against the Dead King, it might mean civil war. That goes double in the First Prince does put her own loyalists on those thrones.
