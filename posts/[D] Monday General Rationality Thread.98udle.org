Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Random thought I had today: I wonder if the brain is affected by a sort of inevitable entropy over time, such that anyone older than age X (500? 1000? 10000 years?) is guaranteed to be insane without extreme intervention. This would be a separate problem from standard aging: you can make the cells live forever, but can you make the human neural algorithm remain organized long enough for extended sanity? If such neural entropy existed, it would put a hard upper limit on how long you could live biologically without "uploading."

*** I wonder about that as well. What makes you think that uploading will save you? (Is it the possibility of editing the brain?)

Imagine Conway's game of life; all finite grids eventually become static or cyclic. And all infinite grids eventually run into processing power issues (ha ha). Conway's game of life is Turing-complete, so if human consciousness is computable, I've got some bad news.... (to be fair, if consciousness weren't computable that would probably be worse news).

Don't worry, though. The amount of time for a very complex pattern to stagnate in that way might be much greater than the lifetime of the universe. You can't go insane if you starve to death first.

Anyways, I wrote a short story about psychological consequences for immortal uploads in response to one of the weekly challenges. Here's a link if you're interested: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0Sx3cbNpozAcMtLO3yG4L3y3tIjpNaKPgqsxxDTgww/edit?usp=sharing][The Only Thing that Proves You]]

Spoiler: without extreme intervention, as you put it, all uploads eventually delete themselves

Yes to the parenthetical. "Uploading" (in quotes because I'm including aggressive artificial neural restructuring of the existing brain) would buy you lots of time because presumably we could come up with ways to combat the mental entropy. Of course, the heat death of the universe is still an upper bound on your possible lifespan.

It might be, assuming artificial intervention. But evolution didn't optimize brains for existing much longer than a hundred years - the biological limit without modifying the basic functioning of the brain may be much shorter.

Interesting story. I looked at the beginning, but it's a bit long for me to read right now.

*** There are some assumptions in your random thought that I'd like to question.

The brain is not a Ship of Theseus. It doesn't replace itself with parts that replicate the existing model, it assesses and reorients existing parts as they're used. The "neural algorithm" is not a singular process, but rather an iterated consequence of a number of other algorithmic processes. In the other direction, distinct parts of the brain are used for different purposes even as the neural operations within each are superficially similar.

So question one: What do you mean by "the brain"? Why is it a singular entity that gets defined as "any" specific "one"? Which part or parts is most important in that assessment?

Question two is about the other assessment: By what measure is "the brain" guaranteed to be "insane"?

It is not unfair to say that every human being thinks differently, even as it is not unfair to say we all think the same. Deviant thought and careful conformity are /each/ both frowned upon and celebrated. Entropy is a decline to disorder, but such disorder could seem like whimsy or creativity... from within and from without.

From the point of view of a mind's eye, seeming and being are separated by a thin border indeed.

So, question three: /Who/ cares?

The brain is not a Ship of Theseus. You aren't constantly rebuilding a copy of yourself. You're a different self than you were when you started reading this, and some impossibly old you wouldn't have the same response to it as you do now. You wouldn't have quite the same response to it if you read it again next year.

Do you care now about the potential insanity of a future you? Do you care about your own sanity now? Do future yous care what any previous version of them thinks about their sanity? If their brains destroy a little of the old order, forgetting thinks that were so it can remember thinks that should have been, does that inspire sanity or insanity? According to whom?

Question three point five: At the heat death of the universe, does it matter if the think that used to be you remembers or resembles what current you thinks at all?

The squishy thing in your skull. Made of evolved biological neurons. I don't privilege any particular part of it. It functions as a whole to generate the experience of a singular consciousness, which values its own continuation.

#+begin_quote
  By what measure is "the brain" guaranteed to be "insane"?
#+end_quote

Good question. I would say either 1) inability to function as an intelligent agent (by some definition of "intelligent" involving ability to survive and thrive without drooling all over yourself and being spoonfed by a nurse in an asylum), or 2) significant mental distress caused by incoherent or conflicting internal experiences. When I had the random thought, I was envisioning people who had lived to, say, 10000 years of age and then began to lose track of which experiences were happening in the present and which were mere memories. Perhaps such a person would experience significant anxiety due to constant deja vu.

It doesn't matter if you change, as long as the change leads to continued thriving for you and society as a whole. Increased mental distress and decreased ability to function in reality are not good for these goals. The insane people I'm envisioning would not say that they are fine with who they are. Rather, they would beg for a cure in their brief moments of lucidity.

Of course, whether this entropic Alzheimer's would actually happen biologically is an open question.

*** A possible effect would simply be that as time passes old stuff gets completely erased. This might become more possible with uploading (after all, the limitations of biological matter are exactly why you /can't/ keep living on biological substrates for more than 100 years or so anyway). So after 5000 years you remember basically nothing of what it was like 5000 years ago, and you're a completely different person. Heck, I'm 32 and I feel like a completely different person than when I was 14, so...

The consciousness remains 'immortal' in the sense of continuity, though it's so thoroughly renewed that in some sense the original person is still dead. But then again, in that sense, perhaps 14-year-old-me is dead too. Unless there's something special about the sense of self and its preservation that we're not getting yet, I'm afraid that ends up being the only logical conclusion.
