** In case it would be interesting to anyone: I have two large distinct [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/WildMassGuessing][WMGs]] about Twig's plot:

1. The possibility of collaboration between Fray and Hayle. Basically, I speculate that they started to conspire against the Crown since before the first Arc, and ignited the civil war to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningBothSides][Run Both Sides]] of it, acquiring power and influence to topple the Crown. Links: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5b9hjh/lamb_arc_14/d9nd0bx/][{1}]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5bskuc/bitter_pill_151/d9qysl6/?context=3][{2}]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/62s4be/lamb_arc_17/dfpikxd/?context=3][{3}]] (second section under 'Hayle'). *Edit:* Or see the compilation [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/63dm12/rthf_twig_arc_18_dog_eat_dog/dfu0206/][below]].

2. About the Crown's ultimate endgame. In short, kill everyone in the world except highest-ranking Nobles and the most competent professors. Use experiments to produce everything necessary, without pesky ineffective humans getting in the way. Link: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5s2anq/a_twig_endgame_speculation/][{1}]].

I'm reasonably confident about the second one (~70%), less so about the first: it feels very shaky, but not completely out-there (~30%?).

*** *Compilation of the first theory.*

1. Entry point.

   In [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-6-lamb-to-the-slaughter/6-x/][6.x]], Avis' Interlude, an unknown double-agent of Fray freed Avis. Whoever it was, he or she had a permission to visit Avis on a regular basis, access to the tools necessary to fix her body, the knowledge to use them, and an opportunity to clear the way for Avis to escape.

   Let's assume [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][Fair-Play Whodunnit]].

   It couldn't have been one of the experiments, since the only Radham's experiment with medical skills known to us is Jamie, and his personality was erased at the time. So it probably was a doctor.

   That leaves Lillian, Gladys, Lacey, Cecil (the nice one, not the ratface one), Huey, Ibbot and Hayle. Cecil and Huey seem far too incompetent for that. Lacey seems suspiciously competent, but we saw the [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-13-black-sheep/13-07/][insides of her mind]] in /Arc 13/, so it's unlikely; Lillian is out for analogous reasons. Gladys, albeit a prodigy, probably still lacks the skills necessary to pull it off.

   Ibbot or Hayle? Ibbot was established as socially incompetent biotech savant. Hayle was established as social expert, specializing in neuroscience. Given the skills, the tone of the message written to Fray, and Avis' condition, Hayle is far more likely.

2. In [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-14-thicker-than-water/lamb-arc-14/][Lamb (Arc 14)]], Hayle says the following:

   #+begin_quote
     The nature of the war may well be changing. I sensed an opportunity many years ago, when I first moved to create the Lambs. I suspected the battlefields would look like they do today. That the enemies wouldn't be generals, but reverends. Not soldiers with rifles and bayonet blades, but scientists with books. Not unstoppable brutes, but things that lurked in shadows. <...> It wasn't so terribly long ago that armies marched to war and stood out on the open field of battle, standing there to reload, aim, and fire as allies and friends to either side of them dropped dead. We've moved well past that. To trenches and waves of dead men, then to dark corners and more refined killers. <...> The nature of the battlefield will change again. The paradigm is shifting once more. I hope I'm able to suss out the coming reality as I did our current one, but only time will tell. <...> I would say that the Lambs are, by design, uniquely suited for the current reality. I'm hopeful you'll collectively determine the nature of the /next/ reality.
   #+end_quote

   Which establishes Hayle as an exceptional long-term player. And indeed, Lambs are very much suited for the current reality. Their success is so great, Hayle moved from the position of a leader of one of the least respected departments of Radham Academy to its headmaster. It's certainly not accidental. But is the not-accidentality caused only by Hayle's foresight?

3. In the same chapter, the following exchange happens:

   #+begin_quote
     “I hate the rain,” Hayle murmured.

     “Hm?” Lillian stirred.

     “It's nothing,” the man said.
   #+end_quote

   The constant rain was long established as one of the hallmarks of a city controlled by the Academy: it is generated by some algae/bacteria in the clouds catalyzed by fumes, and is used to distribute chemicals across the city. Hayle hates it? If one is to seek a deeper meaning, it could mean that Hayle hates the Academy's methodology.

   Of course, it doesn't /really/ mean anything on its own.

4. So, let's assume the conclusion in /point 1/ is correct: Hayle is Fray's double-agent in Radham Academy. His message to Fray is the following:

   #+begin_quote
     I need to act, and I have no freedom. We're speeding headlong into disaster, and [Avis is] the only person I can think of who could pass on a message.
   #+end_quote

   At the time of the message's writing, the headmaster of Radham Academy is the Duke of Francis.

   Half-a-year later, after the message was passed on, the Duke is killed by the rebels, using specialized sniper rifles developed by Fray-Mauer alliance.

   Hayle becomes the headmaster shortly afterwards.

   What a coincidence.

5. Fray at the very least /knew of/ Hayle since before the story. From [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/category/story/arc-3-lips-sealed/3-x-enemy/][3.x]]:

   #+begin_quote
     “Ask Professor Hayle. He'll know,” [Fray said.]
   #+end_quote

6. Taking all of that into account, the theory:

   Hayle and Fray knew each other long before the story's beginning. They both were dissatisfied with the system of the Academies and the Crown. Being long-term thinkers, they agreed on a long-term plan:

   Hayle funds a group of various experiments, with heavy focus on brain augmentation, aiming to create exceptional spies/problem-solvers, and a Wyvern research experiment. Fray starts dosing herself with Wyvern sometime later, possibly using data from the Wyvern experiment. When the Lambs Project is deemed ready, Fray 'fails' her bid for professorship to give herself a convincing motive, and goes off to ignite a civil war.

   The Lambs are tailor-made for this civil war. They prove themselves capable, in turn proving /Hayle/ capable.

   Fray, using her augmented brain and the Academy's knowledge, takes control of the Rebellion. (That part partially fails, with her being unable to convince Cynthia to join forces.)

   Hayle gains influence, riding the wave of the Lambs' success. If something gets in his way, Fray and her Rebellion take care of it.

   Controlling a sizeable fraction of both sides of the conflict, they acquire influence, power, and manipulate events to their liking.

7. What their exact plan is, is unknown, naturally, as well as whether or not they have other influential figures in their little conspiracy.

   Or whether or not Hayle takes Wyvern as well.

It may or may not sound convincing, but to me it feels very... nebulous. A very large theory, basically based on: a reasoning under an assumption, a throwaway line, and a coincidence --- all arranged in a convenient way.

Or perhaps I'm simply biased to think negatively of my own speculations.

**** I am never smart/observant enough to come up with these kind of theories (true or false) when reading, but I must say the beauty of the construction always amazes me, because on the one hand of course it makes perfect sense and on the other hand there's even money you missed the mark by a mile. But if you didn't and this is true, I'll appreciate the reveal even more knowing the clues were actually real and could be picked up by someone not in the know.

Thanks.

#+end_quote

I used to think the same. I think Twig is a special case.

It's a regularly-updating web serial. As opposed to complete books, it /forces/ me to digest every chapter: read it, then skim through a few times, think about what it reveals.

Lately, I've been active in each chapter's discussion, which probably amplified the effect: I told people what I caught or found interesting, read their thoughts, discussed it. (While the clue-hunting there is much lower than was in, say, HPMOR discussions, it's still a factor.) Because of all that, story's plot, worldbuilding information, etc., were and always are fresh on my mind. I make connections between events of the story faster and easier.

I most certainly wouldn't have came up with either theory if I started reading Twig when it was finished. I wouldn't have /stopped to think/, just read on, read on, from the start to the end.

I believe one of the rational fiction writers (I think it was Yudkowsky?) stated this as a probelm they encountered. Even if you tell the reader to stop and think, they /won't/, they'll just continue reading. They had to just-about yell at the readers to do that, repeating the same clue multiple times in the hope that someone would notice it at least once.

In case of these kinds of large-scale theories, you have to keep in mind many characters and significant events on top of paying attention, which is easy to do if you've spent weeks regularly reading and talking about them, but much harder if you sat down and read the book in three days.

Or maybe it's nothing that complicated, and simply I acquired experience arguing with people in the comments. Who knows.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Oh yes. That feeling increases tenfold if /you/ figured out the reveal yourself, then was vindicated. I even made a bet on my second theory!

*Edit:* Oh, right, it was [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries][there]].

#+begin_quote
  [R]eading a story goes by much faster than writing it. If you have not called upon your readers explicitly to halt and pay attention, they are already reading the next sentence. Even if you /do/ explicitly ask them to pay attention, they are already reading the next sentence. If you have your character think, “Hm... there's something funny about that story, I should stop and think about that?” guess what your reader does next? That's right, your reader goes on to read the next sentence immediately, to see what the character thinks about it.
#+end_quote

Substitute 'sentence' with 'chapter'. It would stay true.

**** Not explictly. She said they would be willing to destroy rebellious parts of the world, no matter how large. I propose a stronger version: they ultimately plan to eradicate all human population, rebellious or not.

  If they rule a world that they've reduced to a half the normal size, they still rule. Given science and sufficient time, they can fix what they leveled. When they do, the world will be theirs.
