** Can I just take a moment to say that I really, /really/ love Scott's writing style? I mean, look at this:

#+begin_quote
  Anyone who gave their real name in a business like this was either a fool, or else so arrogant as to defy belief.

  “And I'm Dylan Alvarez.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  Not that he didn't know. Head as smooth as an apple, frame that looked like she could stand to gain forty pounds or so, desperate look in her eyes. And here she was, seeking illicit magical help. Cancer, that was what it was. He could see it from a mile away.

  “I want you to teach me to summon demons.”
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  She looked familiar. Alvarez squinted. If she had a little more flesh on her bones, a bit more hair, then...he still wouldn't be able to place her. Damn.
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  He took a copy of the /Greater Key Of Solomon/ off his shelf. Then a few other grimoires. The /Goetia/. /The Sacred Magic of Abramelin The Mage/. /The Antichrist's Cookbook/. None were relevant to the issue at hand, but he was a ritualist; he played to an audience. Opening a grimoire was a way of saying hey, I'm serious about this demonology thing.
#+end_quote

This is /gold/, man.

*EDIT:* Also, I just realized who Dylan reminds me of so much--Jack Slash, from /Worm/. The same charisma, the same amorality, the same flair for the theatrical (though in Dylan's case that last part is actually necessary to his line of work). I'm not sure what it says about me that I enjoy reading characters like that so much.

*** I can see that comparison. Dylan always seems to be playing to a larger audience, though --- maybe /the largest/ audience, the universe itself --- whereas Jack doesn't seem to really need an audience other than his victim.

There's also a bit of Regent in the way Dylan can gleefully show off his control of a situation. (Think Regent and Shatterbird, for instance.)

Many commenters have already worked out that Dylan is the subject of the "Satan" verse in American Pie, eg "as I watched him on the stage my hands were clenched in fists of rage". That means that he has to do all the other things mentioned in that verse.

So, if Dylan is kabbalistically equivalent to Jack, then - Jack Slash sat on a candlestick, 'cause fire is the Devil's only friend.

***** "Malia" means "bad", but is also a Hawaiian variant of the name "Mary" (note that this chapter is set in /Magdalena/ - in the madonna/whore duality, Magdalene is the /bad/ Mary - but note as well that both Virgin and Magdalene are good figures), "Ngo" is either non-government organization or a Vietnamese pop album by artist Quang Ha - in Vietnamese, "Ngo" means "look". We might thus take her name to mean "Behold the evil one!", or perhaps "A whore for an NGO."

Malia Ngo is an anagram of "Magnolia", which ultimately derives from "magnus", meaning "great". It gets there via Pierra Magnol, the French botanist most famous for setting the categorization of plants still in use today. In 1720, he published in one paper a pair of treatises that each focused on two divisions of plants, a duality that echoes God's two major plants in the Garden; life and knowledge. The magnolia plant symbolizes feminine beauty and is believed to be medicinal in Asian cultures (which, per Ngo, are assuredly relevant). Note that "shrub" is one of the categories Magnol used - and that the rose plant is also a shrub. "Oh rose, you are sick"? Or perhaps "Oh magnolia, you are sick"?

Factor in the name "Lola Rivers" as well - Lola is short for "Dolores", meaning sad, and "Rivers" is kabbalistically equivalent to "Reverse" (see chapter 3, among others) - thus we may understand her fake name to be "Reverse sadness", but nominative determinism suggests this to be a poor name to choose indeed - if Malia is Lola is Robin, then we may understand this pseudonym to be a foretelling: Robin is attempting to reverse the course of heaven and earth - and her own husband - to end suffering and the sorrow it brings, but in doing so has reversed her own moral arc and is set on a path of despair. However, this reversal may allow Malia Ngo's name to be inverted as well, which would produce something like "do not see goodness", a useful warning when none may look on the face of God and live.

We only have the question of Dylan. If he enabled this horrific set of events, then the fact that he's aiming to take down Malia now may be why the universe is letting him count as a good guy: his moral arc is towards mitigating the damage of his greatest mistake. However, it may also be setting him up as a fall guy (which is appropriate - note his similarity to Herod and other villains in killing all of his enemies /except one/, and the hubris in then taking this person into his own ranks) and the slaying of Malia Ngo may be a terrible mistake, an evil only allowed to happen because Dylan refuses to doubt himself.

Thus, we can conclude that Malia Ngo summoned Thamiel, became tainted and radiates evil, but is nonetheless a force for goodness and her impending assassination may be part of the cause of the apocalypse, or we can conclude that Malia Ngo summoned Thamiel, became "sick" and surrendered to evil, and that her impending assassination is one of the ways that justice will be done through the end of the world.

***** Scott's already mentioned that 'Malia' means bad, in the Obama interlude, and that Ngo = NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) earlier on, I think. Those seem to be the two main threads you could pull out of the name.

*** As I said in the comments on Scott's site, this was also back when Dylan was working off the respectable aura of ritual magic, rather than the irreverent aura of placebomancy. If he's smart - and he is, at least in this way - that'd cause him to present himself very, very differently.

*** In not-a-coincidence, the "Comet King visits Hell" arc is entirely pretty recent and thus easy to check

This chapter - September 3, 1999 (New Mexico)\\
[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-56-agony-in-the-garden/][Robin talks to TCK]] - August 1, 1999\\
[[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-55-none-can-visit-his-regions/][TCK visits Hell]] - July 1999

In the other direction, I searched [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unsong/comments/5v47k4/pdfs_unsong_so_far_and_the_study_of_anglophysics/][a PDF copy]] for Never Summer and found the date for that - July 2001, [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-30-over-the-dark-deserts/][in chapter 30]]

#+begin_quote
  In March 2001, the necromancer seized control of Vegas in a spectacular coup. [...] The Comet King, still brokenhearted, at first refused to leave his mourning chamber. But when his children begged and cajoled him, he rose from his bed, gathered his armies, and took up the great sword Sigh for the last time. He marched west. The Other King and his undead legions marched east. On July 29 they met in the Never Summer Mountains near Fort Collins[.]
