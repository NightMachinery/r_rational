** u/Gurkenglas:
#+begin_quote
  Then, an illusion is cast on the loose sheet, rendering it considerably less opaque.
#+end_quote

An illusion that renders something /less/ opaque? Could this be used to see through walls, or even produce invisibility?

If she makes the original paper less opaque (but not the ink) instead of making the ink glow and adds a constant light source below, she can invert the ink on the copy. If she both makes the paper less opaque and makes the ink glow, and adds another sheet with glowing ink below, she can combine two sheets using pointwise OR. If her spell is precise enough, this is already enough to build a parallel computer of parallel power dependent on the ink's precision (but trivially in quadruple digits), with serial time proportional to mana & effort spent. (Combine results from different points by... moving the sheets.)

*** To think of it, the magic here could be replaced by a device with the complexity of a weaving loom: Arrange a few thousand vertical 5-inch pins in a grid (say, 40x60 on a DIN A4 page of checkered paper), separated by a solid mantle on the second and fourth inch. The bottom of each pin is to be in the shape used in hole punchers. The top of each pin is to have a hole in it, so that they can all be held in place by a comblike shape.

Insert the comb, lift the entire device three inches, lift the pins three more inches. Insert a DIN A4 page of checkered paper, with some holes in it. Release the comb, some pins fall through for six inches, the rest falls only one inch to the paper. Insert the comb into the rest, lift it one inch, replace the page with another, punch the pins through the paper, there's your NOT operation. (Release the comb, remove the page, and lower the mantles three inches to reset.)

Stacking holed pages is either OR or AND, depending on which way you see the bits.

** I like the way you've written Twilight's thoughts, interactions with others, and the interactions between those two processes.

The way she thinks reminds me of someone I was once close to, and brings back nostalgia.

The way she acts, however, and the way the other characters treat her, are reminiscent of the story /Asylum,/ by Daemon of Decay.

Biggest visibility typo in this chapter:

#+begin_quote
  You know /that value/ your vigilance and dedication to your studies and your kingdom.
#+end_quote

I think you're missing a pronoun.

I would love to read more, but the vast majority of my reading is on my phone(the rest is physical copies of a book), and using the stock browser compared to my preferred [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader][fanfiction reader]] is like switching /to/ viscera-covered, freshly-removed animal hide(with patches of coarse fur still attached!) pants /from/ silk pants.

*** Does that app take epubs or other ebook formats? I recommend trying out [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]]'s "FanFicFare" plugin, it can download and convert fanfiction from over a hundred different sites - including Fimfiction. I use it to collect and organize all of the fanfic I follow, and transfer stuff to my Kobo to read.

**** It only downloads stories from fanfiction.net. The reason it is so awesome is because of that limitation.

** The story begins [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1][here]].

Basic info is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r][here]].

Thanks for reading (or just clicking)!

I want to get the first chunk out there, but no more daily updates. Partly because I'm wary of spamming reddit, partly because I will run out of content far too soon. =p

** This is neat and I definitely want to see lots more of it. Something about the way Celestia carefully tried to phrase her letter to Twilight in particular was well done.
