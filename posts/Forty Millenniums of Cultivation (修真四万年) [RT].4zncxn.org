/"Even if this universe is truly nothing more than a brutal, bloody, shadowy forest, we Cultivators will burn all that we have just to give off a single weak flickering spark in the darkness!/

/No matter how weak each spark is, how short-lived, how small... As long as the sparks flow unabated, then one day one of those sparks will light some tinder, and that tinder shall light some fallen branches, and those branches shall set ablaze each and every last tree of the forest!/

/In the end, even the smallest sparks will eventually set the shadowy forest ablaze, and illuminate the whole world!"/

tl;dr: If you liked Gurren Lagann (and can read Chinese), you'll like /this one/. You'll like this one a /whole helluva lot./

--------------

*[[http://read.qidian.com/BookReader/GrhBjciXhoI1.aspx][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]]* (FMoC for short) is a Xianxia webnovel I found while digging through the Xianxia genre list at Qidian, a Chinese web fiction website.

Unlike most Xianxia, FMoC is a story that takes the fantasy setting of the average run-of-the-mill Xianxia novel (think high-fantasy Wuxia- lots of kung fu but combined with lots of high-powered magic everywhere), and extrapolates what a setting like that would look like 40,000 years down the line, wars, industrial revolutions, social upheavals and all.

(For more on Xianxia: does anybody remember [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/][this post]] that showed up on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] a while back? In the top comment I pointed out a few things that I considered huge systematic issues with the Xianxia genre. Well, this story approaches those issues and challenges them within the text, in the same way that Harry challenged traditional wizard modes of thought with enlightenment values in HPMOR. This story brings enlightenment values to Xianxia, and then actually tests those values against non-strawman objections, resulting in legitimate philosophical discourse- an absolute rarity and treasure to see in the Xianxia genre.)

--------------

Xianxia, as a genre, is all about the kung fu and martial arts and secret sects and meditations on the Tao and the pursuit of immortality.

In FMoC, sweeping social change has changed the landscape of the Xianxia world forever. Secret sects have developed from being merely schools of kung fu to being corporation-like entities, with grandmasters and elders becoming equivalent to CEOs and Board Chairmen of modern-day corporations. Sufficiently advanced martial arts is the flavor of the setting; martial arts is interwoven into the entire world.

Schools of fine cuisine teach their chefs methods for cooking their food with magical fire and secret techniques for /punching the flavor from one food into another/.

Universities host martial arts tournaments instead of football games. Scientists debate if the fundamental unit of Chi is a Chi Particle or Chi Wave, and have built Large Essence Colliders to test their theories on the nature of Chi. Magical physics is a study in and of itself!

The military uses high-powered enchanted swords that home in on the spiritual markers of enemy souls, rather than drone strikes, and invests countless crystal credits into researching military applications of magic.

And all over the world, everyday practitioners of magic use their abilities to create new technologies, working alongside regular humans. Thanks to the integration of common humanity with the magic of the Cultivators, all sorts of wondrous things have been created, including healing pods, magical prostheses that can even replace the entire body in extreme scenarios, and even transhuman methods of capturing lost souls and bringing them back to life- all things which were once only available to the magic-users, but which have since become available to all, magic users or not.

Heck, they even built a /magic internet/ for muggles and wizards alike!

(There is /so much worldbuilding/ in this story. The amount of worldbuilding necessary to construct this unified transhuman society is, I'd say, comparable to the amount of worldbuilding that To The Stars had to do in order to turn Madoka into a hard science fiction story.)

--------------

And thus, at the beginning of the story, humanity is in an age of prosperity. Even regular mortals can enjoy a standard of living far better than the Cultivator mage-emperors of ancient yore.

But is this prosperity and equality a lie?

Can their society retain its enlightenment values even under existential pressure from forces beyond their world?

Because the mortals, after all, are /only/ mortals. If you're born a muggle, you're born a muggle- and while keeping the muggles around is all good and dandy when your civilization is doing well for itself, what happens when an existential threat or two comes along, and suddenly all these people who can't use any magic to fight the enemy become nothing more than hungry mouths to feed, dragging your culture down, until both the wizards and the muggles descend into a shadowy forest forever, never to reemerge pristine?

/Most/ Xianxia novels answer this question thusly:

"Of course we would throw away the mortals! Mortals don't mean anything, in the long scheme of things. Might makes right- only power is important, in the end, and only the immortal Cultivators- those who pursue the Tao and seek immortality with the power of magic- deserve to survive! Mortals? Mortals are nothing more than insects! There are no sacred values- anything and everything can be traded away, for the slightest more increment of power, to give ourselves an edge over our competitors!"

But /this/ Xianxia novel is different.

FMoC says,

"Normal humans bring lots of stuff to the table! The magic-users can't survive alone, no more than the brain can survive without the heart. Without a large population, where would Cultivators even come from? All humans, if not equal in power, are equal in /worth/! All humans have the right to live and be free! And if the state of reality isn't supportive of this sacred value of ours- well, then we're just going to have to change the universe rather than let ourselves be changed by the universe! That's what it means to be human!"

(do you see what I mean when I say that this story is /very TTGL/ yet)

Most Xianxia is nothing more than mindless Shonen drivel- fight bosses, level up, fight stronger bosses, keep leveling up, rinse and repeat to no end. This story is not /most/ Xianxia. This is a story that dares to implement social change in China's most stale fantasy genre, that dares to actually confront challenging questions about the nature of social contracts, the nature of inherent social inequalities, and the nature of trust.

In a way, FMoC is a deconstruction of most Xianxia- it takes the baseline tropes that writers in that setting take for granted, tropes like 'only personal power is meaningful' and 'everything but leveling up is a distraction' and 'mortals are meaningless, relationships are meaningless, in the end all you'll ever have is yourself', and 'cunning can never overcome valor', and challenges all of that, deconstructing the entire premise of Xianxia novels and presenting a totally different world which still clearly derives its origins from traditional Xianxia.

--------------

To use a Gurren Lagann metaphor:

When the Anti-Spiral comes for humanity, it tells humanity,

"If you band together and execute the top 1% of all Spiral Power users, we will be satisfied that you have reduced your spiral potential enough and spare you from total destruction!",

Will humanity still be able to unite against the Anti-Spirals- or will it fall in upon itself and destroy itself, and leave itself a smoking shell of what it once was?

Is it even right to unite against the Anti-Spirals? If the top 1% of all Spiral Power users only consisted of a few hundred people, would it in fact be ethical to take the lesser, certain evil, rather than stand up to the enemy and risk the death of thousands or millions?

But then, shouldn't the Spiral Power users strike first? After all, the rest of humanity might choose to execute them to accede to the Anti-Spiral's demands! A first strike is needed to subjugate mankind and unite it, so that humanity can face the Anti-Spiral as a single unit... right?

But, knowing the Spiral Power users might possibly come to such a conclusion, how could the normal humans possibly trust them anymore?

How can anybody trust /anybody/?

Can we believe in each other?

/Should/ we believe in each other?

These are the questions asked by this story, and by the protagonist.

This is, at its heart, a story about /humanism/, and whether humanism can prove itself stronger than brutal darwinism, in the end.

--------------

FMoC's antagonists are /intelligent/. Not a single antagonist has been a brute-force type 'I will subjugate you with my raw power' type like in most Xianxia and/or Shonen. Instead, every single arc of the story has been some conspiracy designed to break the unity of humanity apart, to foster dissent and distrust, to prevent the two players of the prisoner's dilemma from hitting the cooperate button. Their motivations for doing this are various, but all quite consistent, and most importantly they're almost all caused by differences in personal values. There may be disgusting villains- but no foolish villains, no inconsistent villains, no cartoonishly-evil villains. /All villains in this story are competent ones./

(This story, really, could be described as "Protagonist foils Quirrell after Quirrell after Quirrell, with at least one Mad-Eye blended in to shake things up".)

(Well, maybe expect for the eldritch space jellyfish. That guy's just a giant kaiju what wants to eat things and get more powerful and take over the universe. Typical fare, really. But all the /human/ villains rely on cunning!)

On the other hand, the protagonist's greatest strengths have always been his intelligence and cunning, rather than his superpowers. (Seriously, one of the first real action scenes in the story is very, very reminiscent of Harry's strategies in the Three Armies War in HPMOR.) The protagonist is a Slytherin, through and through, often even more Slytherin than his antagonists, and he pulls off some amazing stunts of multilayered deception which are marvelous to read.

The protagonist is also an engineer. This mostly manifests in him building lots, and lots, and lots of bombs. And then using bombs in very, very clever ways, to facilitate very, very clever plans. You could say that /it's a blast/ trying to predict what the protagonist will come up with next!

(Though, if we do want to talk superpowers, besides his supernatural kung fu and bombs, the guy does have a /mecha/. That he built himself. And the mecha has a /drill/. That he uses in exactly the way you'd expect. Row row fight the power.)

There are /thirteen hundred chapters/ of this story, and this is shaping up to be one of my favorite rational works ever. It takes Xianxia, enlightenment values, rational storytelling, and GIANT MECHAS- literally every single thing I like in fiction- and blends them all until they're perfectly smooth. The content is consistently high-quality and there's a ridiculous amount of content. It's miraculous to me that a story like this even /exists/.

--------------

The problem, of course, is that this story is in Chinese, and I suspect that most of you folks can't read Chinese. But I think (I /hope/) that I've gotten some of your interests up about this story!

So:

Does anybody have any interest in seeing this translated?

/More importantly, would anybody like to help me translate this into English?/

Again: there are over thirteen hundred chapters of this story. The author frequently posts one or two chapters a day, and sometimes up to four. This story is quite literally their primary job and the source of their revenue, after all, so they're very, very prolific with their writing. Without some help, I literally don't think I can /translate faster than the author writes./

(Also if you have any questions about this story, especially if you're curious and want to know more details but can't read the story for yourself, I would be more than happy to tell you about it! I am a /massive raging fanboy/ of this story now. I haven't been this seduced by a story since... a long time. Maybe since I read HPMOR. This is up there, for me.)


** Wow, You do a good job selling the story to me. I'm going to give it a read. You hit every thing I don't like about the Xianxia genre, but it sounds like FMoC deals with them in ways I enjoy.

If you decide to translate it, feel free to PM me if you want help. I'm fairly busy, and I haven't done big translation projects before, but I wouldn't mind helping out, especially if I get into the story.

It also might help to translate the first couple of chapters to see if the English speaking rational fans like it, as I'm not sure how many people can read Chinese in this subreddit. And its hard to tell just from a blurb if people will like it or not.

*** I might just in fact do the 'translate a few chapters to gauge interest' thing, but I might not pick the first few chapters for that, because the first few chapters are still somewhat fixed in the traditional mold. The story takes a while to get going, and it doesn't begin to introduce the 'enlightened self-interest vs. regular old self-interest' themes until the end of the prologue, which is around chapter 90.

The story begins with a schoolyard bully arc welded together with 'the protagonist applies to kung-fu college', most of which is worldbuilding setup. HPMOR had the advantage that its readers were likely already familiar with the Potterverse; this story had to take a bunch of chapters to explain what it was subverting before it could go and subvert it.

(The story has a little bit of early-installment weirdness going on, which is reasonable when you consider that the author basically posts two chapters a day with probably literally no time to edit whatsoever. The real thematically juicy stuff starts showing up around chapter 90 and only gets juicier and juicier from there on out.)

*** Oh, the 40k in this is /real/. The primary weapons of the human military are /by name/ the chainsword and bolter, and part of the backstory includes an "Emperor" who formed twenty "Primary Sects" but was ultimately betrayed by his most favored son, and forced to retreat to a sealed pocket reality in a state halfway between living and dead.

(And legends say that the man who finds the lost Emperor's sealed reality will inherit all his techniques and manuals and powers, and become a new Emperor for the new age...)

However, so far, all of this seems quite irrelevant to the actual plot, and mostly seems to be textual reference that the author stuck in because they liked WH40k's worldbuilding. (If the story DOES turn out to just be an overblown warhammer fanfiction, I will admit that I'd be /pretty/ disappointed.)

*** I definitely wouldn't say the author has dragged the story on a lot at all! I've read some /awful/ stories where the story clearly has no long-term meaning. This story definitely reads like it has a powerful ending that's been planned from the get-go, and generally speaking all the major plot arcs have progressed the story towards that ending.

I know exactly what kind of story you're talking about with xianxia- there's a ton of xianxia stories that just meander around from place to place, not really accomplishing anything, running the same hamster wheel over and over at increasingly large diameters. This story most certainly does /not/ suffer from that particular ailment.

***** Oh, sorry.

I think I addressed how difficult the chinese was in another post, but, really, the best benchmark is to give it a read yourself and see how comfortable you are with the story. The link's right there in the post, after all.

The romance isn't a huge deal. It's pretty solidly written and the characters are quite three-dimensional, but love isn't what I'd call a major draw of this story. You won't find drama or misunderstandings or romantic conflict or love triangles in this story; the author devotes their energy to other sources of conflict.

One good thing about the protagonist's love relationship is that you can really tell the author is trying his damned hardest to stay away from the 'powerful man earns love by casually protecting helpless damsel' trope which is unfortunately prevalent in xianxia. This love interest has her own life and motivations, and isn't just an accessory to round out the protagonist's self-insert wish fantasy like so many other romantic interests are.

My primary criticism of it would seem to be that the ending doesn't provide a strong answer to the question posed; it's not quite a deus-ex-machina everyone-lives-happily-ever-after ending, but it definitely veered in that direction just a little at the end.

*** I personally find this novel quite easy to read, but I'm a native chinese speaker, so my subjective experience probably isn't exactly representational. (That, and I don't really have any experience with what level of reading comprehension 3rd year college chinese represents.)

The story definitely isn't shakespearean in linguistic sophistication, though; the characters speak with modern chinese internet slang to reinforce the central setting theme of 'a rational magic-using culture that's adapted to the modern age'.

The author also loves coining neologisms that combine real-life STEM/engineering terms with traditional xianxia/taoist-mysticist terminology to create entirely new words- again, to reinforce that 'magic in the age of science' feel the story has. Depending on how familiar you are with physics/chemistry/mathematics terms in chinese, this may or may not be difficult for you.

As an example, the protagonist talks about Dyson Spheres in this setting and wonders if their civilization could eventually aspire to the construction of one- but in this setting, the concept of a circumstellar energy-harvesting device is known as a Pangu Sphere (named after the mythological world-creating figure in taoist mythology who divided the earth from the heavens).

Because obviously Freeman Dyson doesn't exist in this story's setting.

Other similar examples include the renaming of the Pythagorean Theorem after a fictional historical Cultivator who invented the mathematical theorem, the renaming of the unit of measurement 'Newton' after a different historical figure, etc.

The author even writes in a segment where the protagonist freaks out when he realizes that the 'Galactic Standard' he speaks is identical to modern chinese, which should have been impossible since modern chinese has since adapted some loanwords from other languages. (This eventually became a plot point of the overall story.) This particular segment depends on one's familiarity with modern chinese diction, obviously.

(If you do decide to read the story, feel free to bother me if you don't know what a particular segment really means! I'd love to be able to talk with lots more people about this story.)

If you don't have the time, ability, or energy to translate it, have you considered recommending it to sites that translate wuxia novels as a new project?

I'm just really hopeful about this being translated sometime in my lifetime without needing to learn Chinese to read it.

And a lot of plots within plots with backup plots, executed by both the MC and antagonists. Which I really do enjoy, but occasionally wish were less wordy, since there are limits with MTL as to how clear their discussions are. MC is constantly hiding his power level (metaphorically, almost everyone is doing so literally).

**** There's definitely humor in the other Chinese web novels I've been reading, but that just struck me as one of the funniest lines I've seen lately.

It was like the "Nice bird, asshole!" line from the Lies of Locke Lamora, something that without context and buildup wouldn't be too funny, but with those, becomes absolutely hilarious.

I'm at 713 right now, and curious as to whether the space pirate king will become an ally or just be an "enemy of my enemy". He's only just been introduced, but seems pretty cool.

****** Names of places/people/things are a mess, but surprisingly understandable otherwise. I'd say 80-90% comprehension. Individual scenes/details are more difficult to comprehend than the overall chapters and story.
