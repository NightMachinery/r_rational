Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *Death Magic*

For the sake of simplicity, I'll reference the d20srd spells ([[https://www.d20srd.org/indexes/spellLists.htm]]) as a general category, with the labels of spells (i.e. necromancy or healing) used to indicate how much death energy they cost. You can also use pathfinder spells and spells from other source books as long as they aren't too OP.

Additional material costs of spells that cost over 10 GP you have to make/find and use the actual materials required, you can ignore material costs smaller than this at a rate of 4 worm deaths per GP of material cost. Since materials are indicated by cost and not by quantity, approximate material value as $12 dollars in cost per GP. For stuff that can fluctuate a lot or have weird price discrimination, like say diamonds, you can buy the quantity required at its most expensive for the least expensive price you can find to minimize cost.

You can cast death themed spells fueled by the deaths of animals. A necromancy Cantrip (level 0 spell) costs about the death of a single worm to fuel. A necromancy level 1 spell takes the deaths of 4 worms to fuel. Each level of spell up from that takes 4 times more death. So a level 3 necromancy spell takes 64 worms deaths, a level 5 spell takes 1024 worm deaths, a level 7 spell takes 16,384 worm deaths and a level 9 spell takes 262,144 worm deaths.

Spells with the "healing" label cost 256 times to cast. I.e. cure light wounds costs 1024 worm deaths. Non-healing Non-necromancy spells have a casting cost of only 16 times more death, i.e. a non-necromancy level 1 spell costs 64 worm deaths. So casting the 5th level Cleric Spell raise dead costs 262,144 worm deaths, and a diamond value of around $60,000 worth of diamonds (but you can save on this by getting synthetic diamonds that are cheaper but would be worth $60,000 if they could be sold/priced as natural diamonds). Note that you can achieve the effects of raise dead using limited wish but limited wish is level 7, so the death costs come out about even.

You can apply [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#metamagicFeats][Meta-Magic Feats]] to your spells, with each feat applied raising the spell level as indicated by the feat text. You are allowed to raise spells levels past 9th level. For caster level... you can treat it as though you had the minimum required caster level to cast the spell if you were a druid/cleric or wizard (whatever caster level is lowest). Alternatively, you can pay 2^(.75*Caster Level) in additional worm death costs to cast as if your Caster level was that level (so 10th caster level costs 181 worm deaths, 20th caster level costs 32768 worm deaths). For Hit Dice and saves... the average person has around 5-7 HD worth of hit points and saves as if they were somewhere between 5-7th level. So a cure light wounds cures a person about 1/6 worth of their total capacity for injuries.

The deaths of dumb small animals, like chickens, are worth around 64 worms deaths (mice would be worth 32 worms deaths). Thee death of large dumb animals like a cow is worth around 256 worm deaths. The deaths of smarter animals like dogs or pigs is worth around 1024 worm deaths (rates would be worth around 128 worm deaths). The death of a person is worth around around 262144 worm deaths. *Animals and magical things temporarily summoned by spells are not worth any deaths when "killed", because they don't properly die but are rather sent back to the plane there were drawn from!*

You don't have to directly cause the deaths for them to count, but having a close causal relationship counts for more. Deaths directly caused by you (i.e. you cut the worm or the throat yourself) are worth 2 times as much. Deaths indirectly caused by you (i.e. you pushed the button on a machine or had an assistant stab the knife) are worth the baseline amount. Death you were near and indirectly contributed to are worth 1/16 (i.e. euthanizing someone on the brink of death from disease, a pig dying of sickness because you didn't take care of it properly, a worm dying of overcrowding in your wormarimum, an animal being slaughtered in a factory farm you own). Deaths you are merely near are only worth 1/256 (i.e. sneaking around a hospital and standing by dying people). Drawn out, especially painful deaths are worth 2x. Especially peaceful/painless deaths (a person passing away in their sleep, a mouse dying instantly of breathing a poisonous gases designed for euthanasia, a chicken kill cleanly with a single chop) are only worth around 1/2-1/4 (depending on how painless it is). Being within line of sight is the baseline collection rate, within a city block but not line of sight is worth only 1/4, within a mile is worth only 1/64. You can transfer energy to other necromancers at about an efficiency of 1/2 with direct touch contact and 1/4 for line-of-sight.

After absorbing the death energy, there is a non-linear decay rate depending on how much you are holding. You can hold onto 256 worm deaths worth of energy basically indefinitely, 257-512 worm deaths "decays" to 256 worm deaths in about a month, 513-1024 decays to 512 in about a week, 1023-4096 decays to 1024 in about a day, 4097-65,552 decays to 4096 in about an hour, above 65,552 always decays to 65,552 in about 6 minutes unless you are actively in the process of casting a spell or actively collecting energy in which case you can hold onto it for about an hour before it starts to decay.

So... Munchkinry in the case were:

- Only you have this ability
- You can pass on this ability with the cost of a level 5 spell and other people can in turn pass on this ability
- Everyone gets this ability

Death energy is divided between people that would claim it at time of death, no double counting death energy.

Munchkinry optimization:

- Any major exploits/loopholes I didn't close?
- Best way to leverage this into a religion in the case were you are the only one with this ability?
- Best animal/collection method in terms of cost efficiency? (Maybe necromancers will pay factory slaughterhouses to let them press the button for example)
- What spells are most worth it in terms death costs? What spells are barely break even?
- Best way to "game" material costs (for instance buying stuff that is super expensive at one time of year and cheap another or that has very extreme price discrimination)?

**** That works out. Heck, throw in some torture and you can get it up to the death energy to raise 4 people. Note that raise dead has some side effects in its text description:

#+begin_quote
  Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means.
#+end_quote

So the first time this happens, a person is permanently weakened by around 1/5th to 1/7th of their total health/resilience, repeating until they are at around 1/5th-1/7th their original healthiness and each subsequent sacrifice further reduces their stamina by around 1 standard deviation relative to a baseline human. (I might added in the description on relative HD of baseline humans while you were posting, but if anything this is generous compared to if Earth humans were 1 HD commoners)

So I don't consider this an exploit so much as a trade off: someone can temporarily sacrifice themselves and be permanently weakened by the process to save someone else's life.

Also note the decay rate in holding onto death energy so you can't stock up too much this way.

*** The most convenient way to cast would be to just live within a block of a major hospital or other source of death. Even with the distance and no-direct-involvement penalties it still works out to ~250 worm-equivalents per person, so the lower level spells should be within your reach just by being nearby for a few hours. For the higher level stuff, you'd probably want to earn money from casting lesser restoration to cure paralyzed/blind/deaf/diseased people (especially if you can get rich clients that would be willing to pay a significant amount to have their incurable ailments cured. Alternately, just use Fabricate to make diamonds from coal or something.

After getting some money together that way, you would want to set up a way to cast higher level spells. The two main routes would be 1) a wormarium, as with a couple hundred thousand dollars you could easily setup a constant stream of maggots or other small creatures that would be constantly living and dying (giving a decent passive income) or which could be killed on demand (for casting big spells), or 2) generously pay an assistant, who you will give a mask of 100% nitrogen to breathe, causing their painless death. Right after they die, cast revivify on them, the use the remaining energy to cast whatever it was you wanted to cast. If more worm-deaths are needed, just leave the mask on until they die again to save up until you have enough. Assuming a rate of 1 death per minute, this gets you everything short of 9th level healing spells (which run afoul of the 1 hour period of holding deaths in store). If you're willing to get messy, you could actively kill them (say with a knife) and cast revivify immediately to shorten the cycle as much as possible. You should be able to do a combo kill-revivify within 7 seconds (revivify only gives them 1 hp after all), bringing even 9th level healing spells (especially True Resurrection) within your reach.

Other people, and surprisingly many of them, recover from injuries or diseases that are... /surprisingly/ severe.

There's also a bunch of spells that affect pre-existing creatures which might make them give more death energy; for instance, 1 worm death is a certain amount of death energy, but what about 1 colossal worm transmuted with [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/giantVermin.htm][giant vermin]]? Or a humanoid that's been [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/enlargePerson.htm][enlarged?]]

Also, you've kinda overridden metamagic to make it more powerful; different metamagic feats increase the casting level by different amounts. For example Quicken Spell is level +4, whereas Silent Spell is level +1.

**** Oh the meta magic feat thing was a mistake, fixed now.

Giant worms should count like cows... but even if the counted like pigs the cost of enlarging the worm isn't worth the cost of the spell I think? It is a 4th level non-necromancy spell so it costs 4^{4*16=4096,} which if you kill yourself with a knife and get around the value of a pig out of it (its bigger than a pig but dumber than a pig) is below break even. If you find a splatbook or invent a spell with a necromancy themed version of enlarge vermin (maybe enlarge a carrion-eating vermin) then it is cleanly above break even by a factor of 4-8 (depending on exactly how smart giant worms are, it costs 256 and you can make between 512 and 2048 depending on how smart and big the worms are).

I am not sure wall of iron breaks even...a wall of iron is 1 inch thick per four caster levels (with an 11th level caster... lets round that to 2.4 inches, 1/5 ft). 11th level caster/5ft/5ft/1/5ft=55 cubic ft. Google tells me Iron costs $.04 per pound and 55cubic ft will be around 27,000 pounds ([[https://www.aqua-calc.com/calculate/volume-to-weight]]) to get us $1,080 per casting. Maybe if you make the iron on site in a specialty applications that needs in a shape you can make you can get a much better price for the iron? Wall of iron is a 6th level non-necromancy spell 4^{6}/16=65,536. Maybe with spell invention you could get pitted, rusty necromancy themed iron (with a casting cost of 4096) but then people would pay less for it? Even so I don't think it actually pays for itself in livestock or worms? Composting worms are surprisingly expensive on Amazon... 100-250 runs around $20 and $40. Mealworms/wax worms for pet food are cheaper, around $16 for 250. Maybe if you breed your own you could do cheaper? So let's say so using the cheapest kinds of worms and inventing some non-SRD necromancy variant wall of iron you could make around 4 times your money back... with standard wall of iron and more expensive worms you are actually losing money by a factor of 2-4.

Teleport into the right room some far away hospital and start flaying newborn babies to death. Every few minutes, before anyone can react in any meaningful way, you Greater Teleport to a different hospital in a different part of the world. This gives you effectively unlimited death energy, for a few hours. You probably want to cast Shapechange early on to make the killing quick, cheap, reliable, and untraceable. Putting up Foresight and Time Stop might also be a good idea for the fort things to do.

** Reposting mine from last week, since I posted it a bit late:

You are a world traveler, picking up small powerups with each trip. Previously, your powerups have been both relatively minor (social stuff and wilderness survival, mostly) and well-defined. For example, disease resistance is explicit about both what it targets (all pathogens, but not cancer) and how it targets it (your immune system's standard mechanisms and pathways).

Your recent powerup is the capstone of your 15 journeys thus far, and it has no description; only the title, caesura. In your testing, you realize that it is extremely broad. (For example: you can stop time for yourself for a short duration, a-la the D&D Time Stop spell. You can stop perceptual time for someone else. You can cause yourself or another person to have an emotional time-out. You can arrest the momentum of an object relative to your inertial reference frame. You can cause any people playing music with you to have a perfect caesura.)

What are some of the things you do to try to test just how broad it is? What are some of the ways you exploit it? You do not generally have access to any other forms of magic, but you do have the ability to recruit allies / make friends who might have magic in various forms (but not ones you can make specific predictions or assumptions about; "spells that do damage", sure, "the Starlance from Blue Core", definitely not).

(One of the funnier things you could do with this power is get on a train and caesura an object or person not on the train. This would result in them instantly (or at least, faster than human perception, so about 10 milliseconds) accelerating to your velocity relative to the planet you're on.)

*** Okay, so here's a wall of text of things to test. Some of them might seem silly, but they could also be critical if they work.

Well, we've established that you can arrest the momentum of things relative to your frame. What counts as a thing? Is an organ a thing? Can I stop someone's heart but not the rest of them? What about their skin, which I can see, but not the rest of them? Could I run a short distance forward and stop something so that it drifts in the direction I was running? Can I do this to things people are wearing and carrying? Can I stop things relative to part of my body's inertial reference frame (such as to my hand)? What is the smallest thing I can stop? The largest thing? What happens when I stop a stopped thing after I change my reference frame's movement? Can anything disrupt a stopped object? What if stop a piece of paper, and then try to cut something like wood on the edge? Can I stop liquids and gases? Can I stop something I can't perceive but know exists close by?

I can stop time for myself. How am I perceiving things? How can I displace the air if it is stopped? If it isn't stopped, could the continued movement of air be used to disrupt events? Does the continued movement of the things I need to function mean that every use of this time stop power noticed by everyone who knows what to look out for? Of course, with time stopped there is a bunch of things you can do if you can move like I recall being possible with Time Stop from D&D. Want to end someone's life? Pretty simple. Even if them being frozen means you can't displace their flesh, you can still put poison, liquids, or ball bearings in their mouth. Take your pick. I'll not dwell too much on other uses, and I can't think of much else to test.

You can cause others to have an emotional time out. What counts as an emotion? Am I stopping it hormonally, mentally, or both? If I can stop the emotion hormonally, can I stop other hormonal responses? Similarly, other mental processes? Does the timeout stop them having an intrinsic value to what they were emotional about (such as stopping an angry reaction to a person also stopping them caring about the person in a negative manner)?

I admit that the only power I had many good tests for was the inertial stopping power, but I hope this helped!

** You are a rationalist, and you are calibrating your predictions. You notice something odd. You are consistently underconfident on 50% predictions.

That is, if you give something a 50% chance, it actually happens 60% of the time. Saying 'this coin flip will be heads' or 'this coin flip will be tails', you are mysteriously right 60% of the time.

It doesn't work on things you are more confident about (90% doesn't go to 95%, for example, when trying to predict a number that won't come up on a ten-sided die).

If you try to reverse your own predictions at random, it doesn't make the effect go away--you end up reversing more predictions that would have been wrong, keeping the total accuracy at 60%.

However, if you flip a coin to decide which predictions to reverse, the predictions go back to 50%. This leads you to think you have mild clairvoyance, rather than the ability to directly influence outcomes.

How can you use this? (Bonus points if you think of a way that doesn't involve the stock market.) (Extra bonus points if you can think of a way to generate winning lottery numbers.)

***** I could. I really, really could.

--------------

Some points for consideration: The maximum transmission of information occurs when the odds of the next bit being zero or one are closest to 50%. Therefore, a good compression algorithm will give you a bit string where (aside perhaps from the headers) each bit has very close to a 50% chance of being a 1.

This means that I can use this to extract the bitstream of a compressed file from the future, with the proviso that (a) the information in the file must be randomly selected, and (b) there's a 40% chance of getting each individual bit wrong.

There are ways to get around (b). If there was a 50% chance of getting the bit wrong, then we wouldn't be able to decode the bitstream in the present - the error rate would be too high, we'd get zero bits of information. With a /60%/ chance of getting it right, though, we can decode a smidge over one bit of Real Data for every two bits guessed.

So. In the future, we take out bitstream of random data and feed it through a forward error correcting code. (The simplest forward error correcting code is just to send the entire message three times in a row; but there are better options to choose). In this way, we can bring arbitrary data into the present.

As long as that data is random, and as long as it fits into very few bits (since we're going to have to guess it, bit-by-bit, on this end).

Lottery numbers are an example of data that fits these criteria. With a bit of information theory, I can encode a string of lottery numbers by some algorithm, and then pick up that string of numbers six months before the lottery (on the 17th of March next year, on the sheet of paper that I print with this printer, the first block will be... /white./)

It's not limited to lottery numbers, of course. I can also send back very short arbitrary text messages, as long as those messages rely on information unknown in the time I'm sending it to.

*** If I flip a coin, guess what it is, then look at it, presumably I guess correctly 60% of the time.

Suppose I prepare two urns, one with two white balls and three black, one with three white balls and two black. My assistant flips a coin to decide which to hand me. I predict what color of ball I will draw. I draw a ball, put it back, then look in the urn. What % of the time does my prediction match the majority color?

The most straightforward way to model this would be to erase a random third of the rounds where my intuition was wrong from time. In that case, my prediction would match the majority color 52% of the time. I'll run with that model.

Have my assistant write the result of a coin throw on each card of a 52-card deck. Have him draw a card (not telling me which), ask my guess about the coin result, then write it on the card as well. (Presumably about 60% of my predictions match the result, and whenever he asked me twice for the same card I made the same prediction.) Have him ask my guess about what prediction is written on a card, and presumably I will perform as well as in the previous sentence.

Suppose I guess the next 100 bits my assistant will write down, then tell my assistant to copy that sequence, flipping a random 40% of bits. My power might find that it can predict whatever it pleases; the predictions may well spell out "bewareparadox".

A bitcoin nonce is a 256-bit binary number, of which about one in 2^{76} mine a bitcoin. I could guess each bit of the next bitcoin block's nonce, but I dare not risk paradox. Roll a random binary string foo of length 170. Call a nonce that starts with foo a foo-nonce. Call the first winning nonce in some pseudorandom order of all foo-nonces the cool nonce. Guess each bit of the cool nonce. Have a mining program try all foo-nonces in increasing order of edit distance from my guess. Presumably I find the cool nonce within about 2^{86*0.4} tries, so at a trillion-fold speedup over your usual miner. Be careful with that, people might ask how you managed to mine with no real hardware.

Throw 101 coins. For each coin but the first, guess whether it shows the same result as the first. Look at all but the first. If ~60% of the 100 guesses are right, I can deduce what the first coin shows. What now?

I like the multiverse reasoning. I got 50% for the majority matching your prediction, however. Do you mind explaining how you get 52%?

Even without powers you are 60% correct. I like the opportunity for the power to step in and communicate. However, I should add that I imagined that if you make a prediction and then deliberately affect the result, your power doesn't work. You'll get the result you constructed, not the result you predicted.

Brilliant. Limited improvement, immediate gains.

I think you should try hard mode: What if you can only use the power once per day, on something that will happen that day? Unfortunately, hard mode weakens the power significantly.

** Let's go against rules again and try something broken.

*/absolute control over every living human./*

So, lets say, that one person in the world, let's call him villain, (you don't know who, but preferrably someone slightly evil or greedy) gains an absolute control over every living human defined as ability *to give undeniable orders* (but only with *eye contact,* so not cameras) *to every person without any other limits*. Every person under orders starts to feel very strong urge to fullfil the wishes of villain, its basically the strongest urge they have, so they can do everything for villain, including killing their own family, etc. Of course, it does not affect their intelligence level, strenght, etc, so villain can't order them to create super nuclear reactor, etc...

(of course, language barrier etc still stands)

Your mission is to somehow find and stop the villain, because in the long term he will obiously become a threat to humanity and freedom. You can try using any means for that, cooperating with other people, etc, but *all must be done within the rational bounds of our current Earth universe*. So you have to do all the convincing that something bad is happening, etc.

Villain is not aware of your actions.

Reverse scenario: you are the Villain/protagonist with this power, how can you use it?

*** From the perspective of a government-type institution, the power is well within the realm of being counterable. You can have all sensitive personnel wear goggles that show a camera feed rather than a direct view of the world, preventing eye contact. Then, just send a military team (or a drone strike) to kill the villain. If you are aware of their existence but not who they are then it just becomes a waiting game. Because they can only use their power in-person, they should become noticeable long before they become beyond the level of power that can be disposed of by a military team / drone strike / nuke.

*** This power isn't actually all that good...

First, the eye contact issue. Human vision isn't good enough to maintain eye contact at more than ten meters and since the villain can only maintain eye contact with one person at a time, they become unable to command entire crowds. As I interpret it, the villain would need to give orders while maintaining eye contact, meaning that this would only realistically work in a one-on-one scenario.

Second, the information-density issue. Complex orders can take a long time to speak aloud. Even if the villain is speed-talking auctioneer style, this puts a hard cap on the amount of people they can affect per day. Alternatives, such as ordering people to read prepared instructions and obey them can still backfire and involves a lot of prep work.

Third, uncooperative victims. This power does not change people's ethics, morals, psyche, or etc. It simply imposes orders, and while they could order someone to kill their family, the villain can't order people to enjoy it (or they could, but people would be unable to comply because people who don't have superhuman zen self-mastery and can't simply force themselves to like or dislike something). This means that controlling people would be akin to classical demon-summoning where the villain would need to read long legal contracts to his victims.

For example, say the villain corners a clever police officer and orders them to "shoot your partner" whereupon the officer simply shoots the villain until they're dead. Maybe the compulsion fades after death, but even if it doesn't, the order is so wildly ambiguous that it's basically completely ineffectual. Some off-the-top-of-my-head examples:

- Since the order never included a "when", the victim simply makes concrete plans to shoot them later instead of now
- Since the order never specifies exactly who, the victim could interpret "partner" as their spouse at home, buying them time
- Since the order never specifies with what, the victim could simply shoot their partner with a rubber band and fulfill the order

Now, to counter this, the villain could give a more complex order like, "Immediately shoot your partner, John Doe, with your 9mm sidearm." Even this still has loopholes though. For example, shoot doesn't mean lethal, and the victim could shoot his partner in the foot and then gun down the villain. This loop-hole hunt can go on ad-infinitum, and would make ordering people who have at least a little cleverness basically useless without extensive legal-document like compulsions. Essentially, to fully convert someone, they'd need to sit down with them and read some beefy legal contracts to them to minimize loopholes which would take a long time. EVEN IF the villain simply orders someone to read this contract and follow all the orders inside, this doesn't mean that they can't forget what they read because those orders aren't magically enforced.

*** I'll take the role of the villain.

The goal is to take over the world (because why not?). Making eye contact and giving verbal commands to every single human is impossible with 8 billion humans as even if every human lined up to be controlled, you'd die of old age before even getting close to your goal (didn't do the math but it's quite obvious). So what does it mean to take over the world? It means to control all the influential people in the world and have them do your bidding. Presidents, parliamentarians, high court judges, the obscenely wealthy, etc. So, goal defined.

Your adversaries are obviously everyone else in the world. If they knew of you and your powers, they'd resist and try to take you down. So your greatest strength is anonymity.

And what does it mean to control someone? Currently the power is to give an order that cannot be refused. Just make a persistent broad slavery/loyalty order. Something like, "I command you to be absolutely loyal to me."

At this point, I don't really see how world conquest is hard to accomplish. Control someone to meet someone to control them and meet someone... to meet the leader/rich person/whoever. Once you have one influential person under your control, you're able to meet all the rich and influential people. e.g. You could control people on the street to accumulate money to set up a meet-and-greet with any rich person (rich people do public speaking for fees, which you can pay) and then you're in. Once you control a rich person you can meet and control every other rich person plus political leaders who meet-and-greet their top donors.

Rich people do have body guards and security teams, but they'll trust each other enough that a private meet-and-greet at a controlled individual's personal home would be possible. All you need to do is to be careful of listening devices which could pick up your commands which would unmask your anonymity. So, have the controlled rich person do sweeps for listening devices and only go for the control when it's secure.
