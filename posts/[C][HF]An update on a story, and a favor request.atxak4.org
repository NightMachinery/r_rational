A few years ago users [[/u/andor3333][u/andor3333]] and [[/u/traverseda][u/traverseda]] linked you to "The Beginner's Guide to Magical Site Licensing". This was great (for me) because people seemed to enjoy the story and I picked up a lot of new readers. (Thanks guys!) Since then life has moved on, I wrapped up my story, the Starter Serials site shut down, and now I've published it: [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NK7GTBS]]

*/But wait, I'm not asking you to buy it!/*

What's now published on Amazon is quite similar to the original web serial run. It /has/ had a good hard copy edit. I took reader feedback into account, and I cleaned up some other things. (Now the bounty hunters have /names.../) But reading it wouldn't be a new experience.

What would be awesome is if some of the people who have already read it could swing by Amazon and [[https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?clientContext=189-0778504-2932238&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2Fcreate-review%2Fref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_wr_but_top%3Fchannel%3Dglance-detail%26ref_%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_wr_but_top%26asin%3DB07NK7GTBS%26_encoding%3DUTF8&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=amzn_scarface_mobile_us&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&pageId=Amazon&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.pape.max_auth_age=3600&siteState=clientContext%3D140-8098961-6196844%2CsourceUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252Freview%252Fcreate-review%252Fref%253Dcm_cr_dp_d_wr_but_top%253Fchannel%253Dglance-detail%2526ref_%253Dcm_cr_dp_d_wr_but_top%2526asin%253DB07NK7GTBS%2526_encoding%253DUTF8%2Csignature%3DYx7qECwJBy6IWa6CNK6FjNdfL0Yj3D][drop me a rating]]. Hopefully, this will allow Amazon to link it to other similar books and new readers will find it.

*/Of course, if you haven't seen the story before you're welcome to check it out.../*

I think people here enjoyed the story for my approach to magic. I basically ask, "How would cheating physics really be used if magic was real, anyone could do it, and it didn't require unobtanium, or make you evil." The result is, I hope, a very unique world with magic as a fully integrated part of modern society. And it has a plot! For just 99 cents you get intrigue and betrayal, magical Kung Fu and monsters, murder and ancient eldritch beings!

So new readers are totally welcome. :)


** Ha! I /just/ recommended it to this subreddit in the Monday thread.

** Oh, I remember this! I was trying to remember what it was called a while ago but managed to convince myself I was thinking of Unsong due to the similar beginning (man discovers new spell). I'll definitely try rereading it. (Can't remember why I stopped)

*** Awesome, I hope you enjoy it!

FWIW: The book that is currently published is only the first of the two that went up when it was a serial, so there's still some chance you've already read what I've got on Amazon. I want to get the second book up, but I feel like it needs a more extensive rewrite.

*** Thanks so much for trying. Here's a [[https://www.amazon.ca/review/create-review/ref=dpx_acr_wr_link?asin=B07NK7GTBS][Canadian link]]. I don't if that'll work, but I appreciate that you took the time to try.

** I'll check it out. I remember having a good experience with your story when I last saw it pop up here.

Weren't you working on a sequel at one point? What happened with that?

There were two "books" in what went up on starter serials and I've only published the first one. The second needs more editing before it can go up.

I'd like to write a third, but I don't know if I'll be able to get any traction on Amazon and I'd also like to do a serial over at [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] (I've got lots of short stories there, BTW, some might appeal to this group) so I'm not sure what I'll write next.

*** That's great, thanks for reading!

Soooooo the sequel exists, it's still on the internet, and it can be found even by searching this very sub. Or this thread. However, I'm providing that information without warranty as I feel like the sequel needs more editing than the first book, and it might be a different book by the time I'm done with it.

Instead, I'll link this short story: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5m4jdf/alien_minds/]] It's about thinking in a way that readers of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] might enjoy.
