** Couple of thoughts:

Is it really the last one of its species? Other than systematic elimination of all others before this one was lifted, the poisoning of the planet would probably not be enough to just eliminate them that fast.

Could it then not also lift another elements of his species, seeing as it seemed to have obtained a similar level of mental manipulation?

And even if not, other than the planet being completely devoid of natural resources, could it not find a way off planet for it or its kind?

In other words, it's a nice enough comic, but it would gain a lot with the removal of the last two pages, the rushed try to get a book-start-book-end concept and to decry "evolution" as "defeated" end up dragging it down. Specially because the great advantage of the mind as an evolutionary element is increasing the possibilities of adaptation, and that concept passes right by this comic.

*** Indeed. I've seen this comic before, and I've always wondered why so many people seem to see the ending as the creature making the right choice. Surely even if he's the last of his kind it would have been better if he retained his powers and used it to help other creatures in need? It's not like getting off the planet is the issue either, with his precognitive abilities he could just pretend to join the alien and betray him once he's own board.

I think it's probably 'Bad man gave him powers artificially => those powers are bad => choosing to give them up = good'

We can assume that if the whole species becomes extinct at time /t/, then time /t-sigma/ there is one member of the species left. If it's intentional by the alien to wait until there's only one left so it's less likely to betray him, this would make sense.

That's not to say that it's necessarily the most likely situation, just that it's plausible within the setting.

Well yes, I understand this concept, but that is not why I asked that question there. The point is, does at the moment at which this comic passes, the creature is the very last one of its species?

Because if so then it raises a lot of questions: did the other ones get killed before this one was lifted? It mentions armies which implies army of its same species, but supposedly they are all dead? Or does it mean that the whole species will not survive another generation due to what was done to the planet.

Because everything that does not imply that the rest of the species was totally wiped out(and even that), still allows for avenues of exit and adaptation through which the species might survive.

And if he wiped out the whole species except for this one element then he was pretty stupid? He would do better to isolate one and uplift it and then extract it, instead of gambling that the uplift would not have any negative effects. What would happen if the adaptation capabilities of the species would induce a huge growth of his cerebral mass and a brain aneurysm? And what if its psychic powers entered into a feedback loop? When you have a unique source material you do not reduce it to a single element before trying to obtain the desired result product.

** I'm a little uncertain, but was the reason for him getting so smart so quickly is because his species' adaptive abilities ended up magnifying his intellect?
