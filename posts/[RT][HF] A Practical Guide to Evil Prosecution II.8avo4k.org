** I'm really liking how the heavens are being depicted. The seraphim's notion of justice is inhuman and terrifying, but can also see how it can be appealing. The benefit of justice without human flaws.

Seems like the Heavens in this world aren't “good” in the sense mortals see the world, they have their own separate and absolute notion of justice. More of an Order vs. Chaos clash, than Good vs Evil. Though Evil in this seems to be less about purely chaotic smashing everything than in most depictions of a clash like that. Maybe something more like nietzschean individual will to power.

I suspect from this and the prologue the Gods will be increasingly a part of the plot in this book, not just a background feature of the setting. It would be interesting to find out more about the gods Below as well, since they are often referennced but never really discussed. (Cat is surprisingly chill about her Power coming from an alien source she doesn't understand. That may end badly)

I believe the author actually described the primary difference between Good and Evil as being society versus individualism. Heroes surrender their will and are empowered to help others, Villains reject all restraints and are empowered to chase their own desires.

** I love Hanno, The Knight of justice that does not Judge.

Next up, the pyromancer that doesn't burn things, the bard that doesn't play music

*** "But... how did you kill Mogkar, the Cursed Ogre Khan? You didn't have access to any fire! You never have!"

"Oh, but Lean the Bard burned with the desire to have other recognize the genius of his soundless symphonies. You, Elise the Shadow Thief, burn with the craving for embezzling Imperial funds without actually stealing anything. And you, Marcus the Socially Inept Mage, burn with the rage left in you by the Imperial mages who laughed at your Magic Of Friendship That Doesn't Quite Cast Any Spells."

"But-"

"Don't you see? The fire was in you all along."

*** That coin is the mother of all Chekov's Guns, though. And every time it comes up swords, as expected, it adds a little more powder.

It's pretty much guaranteed to come up with an unexpected judgement and go off at some point. The question is: unexpected swords, or unexpected laurels?

Unexpected swords could happen a bunch of ways: Robot Santa (all are naughty and deserve death), condemning a child, condemning Hanno, or one or all of his team (Bard sounds like a good candidate)... but that's not so fun to speculate about.

Much more fun to ask: who might the Choir of Judgement unexpectedly /spare/? Cat's the obvious choice, and thus should be discarded (I said "/unexpectedly/ spare," so she doesn't qualify (unless /that's exactly what they want us to think/)). So, who /else/ might the coin spare?
