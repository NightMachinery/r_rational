Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You're a 16-year-old girl growing up in the midwest near the Rockies. You are a perennial overachiever, 5.0 GPA, Student Council, etc. You are stoic and somewhat emotionally stunted, you are rather rational and look for the solution that will yield the most positive gains, even if it comes at your expense. You, along with four other acquaintances, have received a magical ability. You can now freely manipulate any biological structure your magic deems 'You.'

The limits are as follows, you must maintain a similar material to within a degree of reasonability (ie, white fat to brown fat is ok, white fat to muscle tissue or bone is not), if you want to add or edit a structure you have to have a detailed knowledge on how to do so (the power allows you to examine, but not modify, the structures of any creature you are in contact with, failing that having access to extremely detailed medical diagrams can work though would take much longer to implement with more trial and error), you must retain the same total mass (you can't just make extra bone, but you could alter your body so that it produces bone much more rapidly through natural means and then edit from there), the power does not save states or conceptions (if you change your face to resemble someone else you wouldn't just 'change back,' you'd have to manually reshape it to resemble yourself again), the power requires no 'mana' to function, just intense focus and time (time is based on familiarity with the change being made and the complexity of said change, moving extra muscle mass to an arm fo a strike or changing your femur into a spear would take a second or two, turning your follicles and skin cells into the the chromatophores, iridophores, leucophores and papillae of on octopus could take hours on the other hand).

The other members of the group are as follows-

A Mover/Shaker/Blaster/Striker who can summon and channel the aspects of a Storm

A Striker/Blaster/Breaker/Thinker (Brute/Mover/Stranger) who can see through, summon and merge with Shadows

A Trump that can absorb any magic that moves within 5 feet of him and use it for his own

A Thinker that can see multiple different Fates, allowing them to predict or alter the actions of those around them

You must optimise yourself to fight, and hopefully survive, alongside your friends in a secret war against hostile mages, while also trying to maintain your status as valedictorian; how do you do it?

*** Here is my unpolished train of thought on the subject.

If you're really getting into nitty gritty realism biomancy, the simple answer is that, unless the observation skill gives very very good information, pretty much any major self-modification will throw up serious cascading problems and potentially kill the biomancer. The human body is not modular; any issue or change in the body causes cascading changes everywhere else. The magic would have to provide guidelines, safety measures, computational ability and self-observational ability for the biomancer to not immediately grow ill and die.

At a less nitty gritty level, the biomancer should stick loosely to existing human biological processes. Assisted clone births for duplication, building muscle, and reaching peak human performance, namely. Maybe prevent pain by killing off sensory neurons temporarily? Also possibly minor cosmetic surgeries like changing skin colour, hair properties.

That observation skill plus peak human performance calls for great field or cosmetic surgery potential on allies and precision combat against enemies. It also allows for diagnosing teammates of illness, identifying spies, works as a lie detector, gives a limited history of the observed as in autopsies or archeology, or might assist in teaching or brainwashing.

In crazier territory; can special organs be created to interface with/ surgically operate on others? Could the observational ability allow tailor made diseases/parasites to be made to infect/kill/take over another creature? Can hormones/ drugs be synthesised and used /sold? Assuming the smaller concerns are addressed, of course.

Can cooperation with the Thinker sidestep the lack of knowledge? If the thinker can find a safe way for the biomancer to massively grow computational ability, then any problem can theoretically be solved through the application of sufficient computing time and biomass.

No matter what, the biomancer should cultivate mass ASAP. Maybe the observation skill allows for more skillful eating?

Is the observational ability triggered on the countless micro-organisms within and without the biomancer? Does this drive the biomancer insane? If not, can the extraordinary multitasking ability be used as a calculator/ computer through a combination of the manipulation of the gut biome and the observation of the microfauna?

Totipotent cells pretty neatly sidestep the innability to change between cell types. Totipotent cell production rate could actually be a serious bottleneck.

Consider creating that egg clone, shapeshifting into a shortlived combat form, then changing back to the observed form of that clone before inevitable death.

*** I wouldn't dare try to mess with anything at first for fear of messing some bodily function up, and I'd never dare work on my brain. so step zero would be touching a whole lot of people, and always having one of my team members at hand (preferably the Thinker who could likely check my work) who I can easily touch to jog my memory on a particular process.

First action: push the boundaries of what constitutes "me" by seeing what layers of skin can be manipulated, how far through the digestive system an object must be, how much control I have over my hair and finger nails, how much I am able to manipulate the bacteria on and inside of my body, what I can do with any blood that may come out through open wounds.

For any permanent changes to my body I may want to make, I'll research the amino-acid specifications of CRISPR, and have that go to town on gene editing. To combat any mistakes, it may be worth it to invest in limited cloning of myself (just to fetus form, without any brain function, or even with brain function if the first doesn't count as a creature) so I can check to make sure my genome is sound by bringing a cell to the surface of my skin, using it's nucleus for a clone, and checking that creature's genome with the original fetus. Thankfully, being a girl, I would come pre-equiped with the proper machinery to make such clones permanent.

Second action: get my hands on the malaria virus and creating a counter virus/bacteria/other with my own biosphere if it seems easy enough, gene editing myself so I constantly produce that, and go on a tour of Africa and Southeast Asia.

Potential problems so far: viruses may not count as creatures, it'll take a lot of mental energy on my part to make significant changes to myself through gene editing, how do I keep the clones alive? How do I get on a tour of Africa and Southeast Asia? How do I get my hands on malaria?

If viruses don't count as creatures, I'll see if mosquitos/bugs can give info on virus, and if they don't count as creatures I'll see if people do, although with limited access to Africa and Southeast Asia I may have to drop the project all together at this point.

If gene editing turns out to be harder than a few online courses and textbooks (likely freely downloaded from Archive.org or Library Genesis) can handle, then simply copying already identified Phenotypes from stuff will have to do, with some basic molecular machinery mixed in as well.

Keeping clones alive? This is a tough problem, but I think can be most simply solved by stealing some liquid nitrogen from the school, and keeping them cryogenically frozen in an ice chest or other container, getting the Thinker to help me figure out a safe place to hide them, and potentially the Striker/Blaster/Breaker/Thinker (Brute/Mover/Stranger) to shroud the place in shadow. I presume it would be very devastating to my valedictorian status if these half-formed frozen babies were discovered.

How do I get on a tour of Africa and Southeast Asia? How do I get my hands on malaria? Meh, the more I think about this problem, the more problems I find, may need to scrap this plan or make the virus universally contractible and hope it eventually reaches the problem areas.

To limit the time spent on body modification, structures can be created using CRISPR which can be triggered by a single protein or chemical, not commonly found in the body, which I can eat or have injected in me to constitute as me so I can move those chemicals or proteins into activation sites on the structure to trigger a process. This can be used for things like coating my skin in poison dart frog poison, releasing chemicals from my skin (airborne or liquid), and other semi-minor typically global things I may want done quickly.

For pocket money I would make and sell drugs on the black market. Would likely want the shadow person to do the actual selling, as they could both hide their identity, intimidate competing gangs, and avoid being followed. If we launder the money (maybe through fake scholarships and such) this could be a way to get to Africa and Southeast Asia and cure malaria, as well as be a source of tremendous money for other projects. These same drugs could also be repurposed for fighting. using my bone as a needle and lots of heroin in my system (made sure not to interact with anything important, or maybe surrounded by proteins that are broken down by other proteins as it goes through the "needle) to take out my enemies for good without killing them (or killing them if needed). In fact, I could cover my entire body in similar simple spikes which use the same process as bee stings to inject the heroin in anyone were to touch me.

If blood is still counted as me outside my body, I could use it to control machines, wreak even more havoc if I get it in other people (or do even more good). Combined with the creature touch, I could probably worm my way into taking control of their body to an even greater extent than my own.

We could violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics by making HCl and NaOH and mixing the two, creating lots of heat.

As far as school goes, I could always make myself look amazing, take as many bio and chem classes as possible, as well as ecology, and math (since this will be useful if gene editing and protein result prediction becomes harder than originally thought)

I could likely work out a way to get cancer cells into my enemies (gene edited through CRISPR).

In 2 years I could create and sell more useful drugs, setting up the steps necessary to grow the necessary facilities in my womb, and use the proceeds for the war effort. To both launder illegal money up to this point and make even more money I would use the fate teller to predict the stock market and run angel investing.

We could make a power plant run by the electricity from the storm summoner.

looking pregnant while pregnant with clones and drug factories would be a problem for my valedictorian status, however the first time I could get an "abortion," and subsequent clonings I could likely buy a pig from drug money, and impregnate that.

IDK just a few starting points, not many explicit ideas in here, just general principles. I'd be very appreciative if you could tell me how the experiments would turn out, and anything I missed or misunderstood.

**** So I'm just going to go point by point here because you've given me a lot to go over (in a good way)!

The buddy system works well here.

The magic is very strict on what is you; it must be a contiguous part of your body, must be grown inside you, from scratch, using your cells, can no be attached to another souled creature (i.e., an infant). This effectively means you can see, but not interact with, the various microbes in your body. Hair and fingernails are fine, and blood ceases to be you the moment it exits the body.

Altering amino acids is within the bounds of the power, but cloning is a no go, as it would be considered a different souled entity; your power is magical, not genetic and just because a creature shares your DNA doesn't mean their soul is the same as well (think identical twins here).

Second action is somewhat unfeasible for multiple reasons, most of which you touch on; the malaria virus isn't something a typical American high schooler can reasonably get their hands on, going to a different country would also be difficult as a minor who must attend school and has parents, viruses do not count as creatures, clones don't work making the testing difficult, and all this is predicated on the concept that the effort spent curing malaria is more beneficial than fighting in a crucially important conflict, so I agree that it's out.

Gene editing would be tricky, but the power has some intuition to it (to within one degree of reason) so as long as you have a clear goal and good knowledge as to what you want to do and how it can affect most of the change for you, eliminating a good chunk of the trial and error.

This method wouldn't properly work, as ingesting something doesn't cause the power to identify it as you, you can still affect the same changes, albeit manually.

The character would have a rather anti-illegal drugs view, but most of the same could be achieved by her selling excess organs. As for the whole heroin thing, several natural paralytics, like Fugu fish or Wasp venom, should also work. Failing that, she would view killing as the most logical and efficient, if least palatable, course of action.

The Fate teller's power allows her to see the most likely series of events, provided no outside magical force acts upon it, of anything she can physically see. Stock market predictions aren't particularly great here.

The Storm summoner can only channel electricity through his limbs, and he is afforded minimal protection from its effects. It is excruciating and can cause long term nerve damage if no preventative measures are in place.

Sorry I said no a ton. The power is rather specific, partly to avoid a lot of the loopholes here and partly because of its origin. I'd be interested to see any updated hypothesis you come up with though!

***** I like your idea about the organ donation stuff.

Along the lines of cloning, I was thinking more cloning via typical scientific means, where you swipe the nucleus of one of your cells with the nucleus of an egg cell and insert that egg cell into the womb. No magical interaction necessary. If this was done, when would I find the fetus no longer counted as a separate organism, and would I be able to see it's biology while it was in me?

Also, if I found that I could easily make self sustaining factories through meiosis and the manipulation of amino acids into proteins, the creation of a whole lot of chemicals and materials would be trivial. I would begin by making plastics such as Kevlar (Or, taking a page out of Worm, spider silk) that could be used well in a fight. This capability would also be useful as a means of profit generation.

Creating and injecting a virus which adds genes which cause catastrophic failure in potential enemies' biology when an otherwise harmless chemical is encountered would be near the top of my list of actions if my morality aims more towards the logical and efficient than the respecting life end of the spectrum.

The point of heroin wasn't to take an enemy out of the fight, it was to get them addicted and take them permanently out of action without actually killing them. Would this be in line with the character's morals?

For any possible minions I may acquire, synthetic drugs that are both addictive, nootropics, and stuff that only I can give them would save a lot of hassle with possible trust issues resulting from my emotional stuntedness. Maybe we could add some steroids into the mix as well for the goons and stuff, and fallback to the catastrophic failure virus if there's a cue. If morally acceptable, I could offload my schoolwork onto them, while I study more serious subjects.

A way to release chemicals that release dopamine in the brain (to all but me) would be useful during any negotiations, but may only be limited to a single instance if word gets out that this is a possible strategy.

Self sustaining factories making more factories could be useful, especially if I don't want to be pregnant every time I need a new factory. They could also be used for shrinking the size of my belly when being pregnant with a factory, as once the factory is born it could make a more complex factory that does what I want it to do, or it could simply morph into that factory it's self.

Building machines (through use of factories or birth) which could have electrical inputs and outputs could introduce all sorts of nifty long distance and more advanced processing potential. If I can find a way to hook up small computers and wireless transmitters to bug like creations, and I become sufficiently good at programing, the spying opportunities are endless. At minimum I may be able to hook something up to a factory to produce a pathogen (like the virus proposed earlier) in an enemy base. The more I write about this aspect, the less sure I am that it'd actually work, as it almost entirely depends on a skill set that I don't already have, and would be too swamped with work to gain.

If moving my hair is within the magical constraints, then I will definitely grow out my hair (does the resulting hair extension through the acceleration of hair growth count as a permanent change? If not, wearing a hat and re-purposing the rest of my hair into one long strand would be my go-to solution for this) so a strand of it would be able to theoretically explore an entire house, and on the fly repurposing of nerves onto that hair (how long would this take?), certainly not hooked up to any pain centers. This would be useful in situations where I'm in a new environment, or I need to find out what's inside someone's pockets. Making the nerves denser in more interesting areas for better tactical feel. The usefulness of this would depend on how much knowledge I have of where different parts of my hair are. Would this work?

some questions and clarifications:

- How intuitive is it for me to edit my genome?

- How much internal knowledge do I have? I presume I must have some baseline amount or else I wouldn't be able to edit anything.

- How intuitive is protein creation for me? Right now protein folding prediction is incredibly difficult, would I find this task easier, and if so, how much?

- Would my factories count as separate creatures or simply machines? What if I add a basic nervous system used only for carrying electrical signals from one part of the machine to the other?

- How complex could the machines I make reasonably get, factoring in the limits of the magic and my own ability?

*** Grow an extra tumor of brain tissue and play around with it to learn how brains work. Be careful about doing your own brain, you don't have backups. I've heard that evolutionarily, brain size is limited by how much head will fit through a birth canal - you can improve on this. I don't know how brains work, but the least an extra brain will give you is an extra you to think/study. I will assume that as in Worm, you have an extra cortex that interfaces with your power. Copying it might not copy access to the power, but growing and splitting it might. Grow a clone fetus, equip it with your brain, and you could acquire extra bodies.

*** Well, an obvious application is to almost instantly heal any injury that leaves me conscious. Another obvious application is to come into contact with a serious athlete, and reshape my own muscles to shortcut through months of exercise.

The ability to move fat around in my body also allows me to sculpt my figure in accordance with the dictates of vanity, which will lead to positive social interactions and bolster my self-confidence. Furthermore, this will enable me to more easily persuade boys of similar age to help out with trivial tasks (probably usually nothing that puts them in physical danger), making it that much easier to maintain my valedictorian status /and/ get alerted of hostile mage activity (even if the boys do no more than send a text message).
