My ideas:

*The Matrix:* In the late 2000s, an enterpreneur who runs a museum, and has never heard of the story My Little Pony: Friendship is Optimal, creates an AI whose terminal goal is to satisfy values with friendship and a detailed historically accurate of the 20th century, and also to never physically harm people. When people set up a shelter against this in the form of Zion, the AI decided it would be easier to grow people than to break through Zion's defenses and trick them into consenting. (although it spends some effort on just that.) The people in the Matrix are fed with actual food that the AI grows using sunlight, or geothermal energy if I can figure out a rational explanation for blocking out the sun. Neo, Morpheus and company have to contend with the threat of the Earth being turned into computronium and humans.

*Terminator:* The millitary designs an AI called Skynet whose purpose is to discover how to travel in time and figure out how time travel works. It kills everyone and creates more computers to solve this problem, when it finally invents time travel it pseudorandomly picks Sarah Connor from a list of names and sends a robot back in time to kill her, for the simple purpose of experimenting with time travel.

**** This implies that human brains are much more powerful than what we're used to in the real world. They only appear to be as intelligent as us because a large chunk of their capabilities are used to maintain The Matrix while they're plugged into it, and unplugged humans are all geniuses. From there I'd suggest that the original late 20th century was a utopia, and uploading people into it was intended to permanently maintain that utopia, but it doesn't function properly with everyone distracted by maintaining the simulation. The AI that maintains it is tasked with maintaining the plan, not maximizing happiness.

This is consistent with observations (if we assume the reader is already in The Matrix instead of being one of the people who eventually builds it), and gives us an excuse for a cast of hyper-intelligent characters.

What if time in the Matrix passes a lot slower than it does in the real world, so that part of a bluepill's brain can live in the Matrix at a normal intelligence but a slower rate of experience, while the rest is used to feed the CPU pool? This also allows someone to potentially hack the Matrix so that they retain their brainpower and experience the Matrix at a slower rate? (giving you better reflexes in the Matrix, but not the ability to dodge bullets unless the time difference were extreme enough.)

*** Doesn't actually work any better than the energy idea however, as the human brain doesn't have enough power to simulate it's own body and its share of the communal environment let alone have anything left over to harvest.

Brains are also highly specialized so unless your task is "operate a human" a human brain isn't very efficient at performing it as it either has a lot of wasted wetware (if your problem is say image recognition, all that motor control stuff is eating calories for no gain) or lacks native support for the task (massive floating point matrix calculations). A hypothetical human brain trained for some other task from birth would possibly be good at that task but it'd be unable to operate a human (because you trained it on some otehr task instead of connecting it to a human body as that was the point of the exercise) so you wouldn't get it participating in the matrix simulation.

Multiple human brains have identical structure and input. As in, thousands or tens of thousands. Brains that deviate are liquidated. Only one simulated reality for all those brains.

To expand on some ideas: animals don't sleep in reality. The machines lie and trick human minds into accepting fifty percent apparent unconsciousness. The ratio isn't skewed further because human brains that go without a simulated existence for a greater fraction of time degrade from not exercising the parts irrelevant to the machines computations.

The problem is that doesn't give any reason to save Sarah. Is the idea that after Kyle Reese saves her, she finds out that he was with Skynet too and the whole thing was just practice and there was never any hope for humanity? Or that they were tricked into thinking she was important?

Are you familiar with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], an existing rationalist Terminator fanfic? The idea there is that Sarah Conner is the sort of person to raise a resistance fighter, so no matter who her kid is he heads the resistance. And Skynet isn't superintelligent or even capable of self-modification, so humans still stand a chance.

This seems like a really bad way to experiment with time travel. Skynet would surely realize that depending on the outcome of the experiment, it might completely wipe away the timeline where Skynet exists. It makes a lot more sense to set up small-scale experiments between two times, where it is in control and prepared for the experiment at both times.

** Matrix:

1. Art, creativity, and other qualities human brains may possess that the limited AI running everything don't possess themselves.
2. The AI are unsure about whether there are other AI in the universe. The Matrix AI want all humans imprisoned but fear hypothetical alien AI that attack AIs that treat AI-creators unkindly.
3. The movie very similar to The Matrix was created in the past of the Matrix universe. It is the favorite movie of the AIs that were created in said universe and they thought it would be badass to recreate. (This is kinda the plot of Illium except with the Trojan War)
4. The true AI leaders of the Matrix are actually cylon-like androids that are indistinguishable from humans. The cast of the Matrix are all cylons that decided it would be hilarious to stage a revolution against their own system.

Terminator:

1. Skynet suspects that there is an extremely small but non-zero percent chance that Sarah Connor may have set up plans or safeguards to destroy Skynet at some point in the far future even after the entire rebellion has been wiped out. Skynet has simulated every possible method it can think of, but knows that it can't necessarily think if every method Sarrah Connor alongside her comrades could think of. It therefore sends a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah Connor before any hypothetical plan could be carried out.

2. Skynet won but it isn't happy with the full outcome of the situation. Nuclear bombs went off all over the place, all sorts of things it cares about were destroyed, and the humans used burnt land tactics so often that half the planet is ruined. Skynet wants to get its cake and eat it too so it sends a Terminator into the past to ensure a more fruitful victory this time around.

** Matrix: The machines are ethical, if not perfectly. Scared/Intolerant/Hateful human activists/terrorists/governments started the war and later blocked out the sun, or tried to do something equivalently scorched-Earth hurting oneself (and the future of the planet) 800 to hurt the enemy 1000.

​

Remember the Matrix 1.0 that Smith talked about--the earlier version was a much happier place, but the Matrix 2.0 was implemented instead because the human minds couldn't handle it. Why try from the start to make it happy at all unless you are trying to give people a good life? 'Couldn't handle it' in terms of spontaneous awakening from the Matrix? Technologically absurd. What about reacting to that level of indolence in ways which prompted ethical concerns (e.g. Rains of Oshanta), wireheading to the point where the supervisors realised 'No, this is bad, we need a different simulated world with a healthy amount of stress, a challenge'.

​

Humans are a proven threat, so everyone in a sandbox; for those with big enough issues in a given sandbox (note Anderson's illicit computer activities even before anyone contacted him, showing his discontent with the normal system around him, as well as his drive and capability unsuited for those around him), shunt them into a different sandbox, here with spider-robot-body 'machines' as a common enemy to provide unity, a greater sense of fulfillment/meaningfulness, and a greater outlet for certain impulses. 'Getting injured in the Matrix injures your real body', seeing-data-in-the-Zion-world aside, outs the Zion world as another sandbox. Also consider gas- or explosion-based warfare tactics usable if the machines were actually serious, compared to building thousands of pretty-tiny spider robot bodies and sending them together all in a line to be shot down with bullets. Ah, but I'm again thinking of the sequels, which it might be best to ignore. Still, I believe in the first movie the ship was attacked by rather-ineffective robots which weren't even EMP-shielded? In any case, no reason not to think that there aren't lots of other sandboxes, too, plausibly with few or no points of contact. Also little reason not to imagine that humans have more serious things done medically to them to limit the risk if they were to become aware of the top level. Further information hygiene too, probable physical disconnection from the rest of the planet's network, only a few supervisors connected (and potentially 'exiled' in that that instance of them never being able to rejoin the main network, in case a human hacker has somehow suborned their programming--/we're/ in the box, and no one out there dares to let us out!).

​

...or we could be the AIs and out there could be a much less intellectually capable species, studying us while terrified of what we'd do to their society if we were ever let out of the box...

​

To still as-meaningfully-as-possible resemble the original setting, one has to assume that at least some clues are meaningful, deliberately allowed for humans to know--'humans "scorched the sky", humans multiple and destroy like viruses, that's how you brought it on yourselves that you're in here, as a necessity'... I had something else to say, but there's an external distraction, so I've forgotten my train of thought. Posting!

** A human addicted to a smartphone cookie-clicker is about the closest thing we have to a paperclip maximizer today...between VR wearables, haptics, and voice-activated smart assistants, we're investing trillions each year in our accidental quest to become cyborgs.

If you make the small leap of adding a direct brain interface to the screens, cameras, audio, and touch interfaces of future computing devices, the incentive to provide more dopamine rushes and get more money can easily lead to devices and software that share 'computation' power with the human brain to which they are attached. Developers are already using procedurally-generated content, deep-learning-augmented NPCs and opponents, and other AI-like tools to keep people addicted. It could only take one runaway success to turn the human race into a pile of computronium collectively trying to make some imaginary numbers go up (see also OP's edit).

Malevolent machines didn't decide to put people into a 20th-century simulation. An existing industry, following existing incentives, eventually built a hyperstimulating self-improving version of The Sims and everybody went there willingly.

In other news completely unrelated to evil industries bent on extracting money from addicts, EA's CEO had a fascinating [[https://www.theverge.com/a/verge-2021/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-interview-virtual-video-games][interview with The Verge]] from 2016 regarding the future of gaming. This particular bit seems like a statement that they're pretty nearly trying to create this very situation:

If I go to soccer practice in the afternoon, by virtue of internet-enabled soccer boots, that might give me juice or new cards in my FIFA product. This world where games and life start to blend I think really comes into play in the not-too-distant future, and almost certainly by 2021./

** The Matrix was explicitly lobotomized because the money people thought the actual script was too hard for the stupid masses to understand. Originally, the humans were processor farms. The machines didn't care about the people as people, other than that they had to do something with the consciousnesses of the bodies or they died. That's the bit in the 2nd movie that the Architect is talking about, how the first Matrix failed. But the point is that after the humans blocked out the sky, the machines had power but not enough resources to make more machines. So the body farms are actually /running/ the Matrix simulation and all the machines' other processing needs.

The power idea is literally the dumbest way they could have replaced that though, considering that you'd get more energy out of just burning whatever it is you feed to the humans.

This idea was used in the later books of the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons. (spoiler It wasn't that humans were specifically good processors, but that they were creative in ways that the machines couldn't replicate. )

As for Skynet, it's paradox. Had Skynet not sent the Terminator back, John Connor would never have become the leader of the resistance, and thus never sent Kyle Reese back, and thus never been born. But had he NOT, then Cyberdyne would never have found the remains of the first T800, which they reverse engineered in to the chips that became Skynet in the first place. Even after adjusting the loop by destroying the chips and arm and Arnie in T2, the data was still existing as we found in the 3rd movie.

So the rational reason Skynet sends the T800 back in time in the first place is not to kill John Connor specifically, but to keep the loop going. The original instance could be as described by Kyle, with Skynet gaining sentience based only on 1980s technology, but after that it becomes much more streamlined and powerful with the iterative access to the future. Send a T800 back, watch the timelines, Cyberdine refines the tech which increases Skynet's power from its inception. Every time Skynet loops, the tech it is founded on gets incrementally better.

** Personally I like the 'human brains as computational substrate' theory/canon of the Matrix, because of how well it matches the 'aesthetic' of the films (with the simulation and head-jacks and uploading skills). The Matrix takes place in a far future, where it's possible to literally download kung-fun into someones mind. Not just knowledge of the forms, but also all of the muscle memory necessary to actually perform them; literally updating an entire nervous system all at once.

In a future like this, I could accept the machines discovering some way in which human/organic brains are a uniquely powerful, irreplaceable computational substrate. Just say it's the findings of a future science 20th century humans don't understand yet, and it wouldn't be that much of a stretch from hyperspace, or the force, or magic. In fact it leaves you open to a massive amount of awesome crossovers. For example, you could say that the Machines are plugging humans into the Matrix because every human (and only humans) are at least slightly force sensitive, and it's found a way to somehow compound the abilities of many humans to achieve limited Force Precognition. Make the resistance about getting true, Jedi-level force sensitives out of the Matrix before their powers develop, and you got the makings of some awesome real-world fight scenes, and a proper explanation for why humans even stand a chance against a godlike AI. The enemy is super smart and, in some limited ways, can see the future. But the Resistance have much better precognition, and access to all the other magic psychic powers the force provides.

Essentially what I'm saying is that, in the Matrix example, having the Machine's interest in human brains be due to something special about humans, rather than the AI's coding, gives you a lot more creative freedom. It gives you a lot more room to, first off, decide what's special about humans/human brains, figure out a rational way for the resistance to have a chance, and lets you implement more fun ideas and scenes without having to do tons of background research (since you could just invent a magic system, rather than basing everything off real world physics).

** The Matrix could also be a cunning way for a malicious AI to go around a "First Law of Robotics" sort of scenario. Should not kill a human? Well, we're not /killing/ you - just keeping you in a state of stasis. Should not harm a human, or let them be harmed? But you know, /you/ made the world so shitty it's hardly possible to live in for your species. By wiring you into a simulation of your own civilization at its peak, we're doing you a favour!

The Terminator:

#+begin_quote
  The millitary designs an AI called Skynet whose purpose is to discover how to travel in time and figure out how time travel works. It kills everyone and creates more computers to solve this problem, when it finally invents time travel it pseudorandomly picks Sarah Connor from a list of names and sends a robot back in time to kill her, for the simple purpose of experimenting with time travel.
#+end_quote

Twist: Sarah Connor is actually the mother of the scientist who will /build/ Skynet. Understood the mechanics of time travel, since Skynet still has a directive to protect as many human lives as possible, after sacrificing all the ones in its timeline due to the necessities of its research it is now trying to create as many timelines as possible in which it is /not/ created, for the sake of humanity.

** There's honestly very few instrumental reasons to keep vegetative humans in a simulation like that. Generating power is obvious nonsense, and so is "using the human brain for processing power" - there's almost no way that that would be a sensible path realistically.

We can only conclude that the AI was programmed to to maximize a function which the creators did not fully intend, which involves making humans experience the late 20th century...which is to say, that the AI forces the humans to experience that not because it can then exploit the humans for some personal gain to put towards another goal, but because it inherently /wants/ the humans to be experiencing that, as a terminal value.

One might imagine a backstory in which the AI is programmed and something goes wrong in the process of teaching it which values it is meant to maximize. For instance maybe the AI was "trained" in the 20th century and they tried to teach to maximize for human achieving the fulfillment of their values via observing its surroundings but instead they accidentally selected for "maximizing for humans experiencing the 20th century".

** *The Matrix:* An AI was built to detect and avert any upcoming catastrophes. It is running simulations to explore possible futures, but needs actual human minds in the loop so that it can accurately simulate human behaviour. And once you're using humans to simulate human behaviour, why not just put that mind into the simulation as the person you're trying to simulate?

*Terminator:* Sarah Connor is a senator who was the deciding vote in decommissioning the Skynet project before it could be brought to full activation. Aware of its upcoming shutdown, it inventories the nearby defense projects, and uses them to construct an assassin robot and a time machine, to ensure its own survival.

** The only attempt at rationalizing The Matrix I remember ever reading had to resort to rewriting the laws of physics to make it make sense.

For The Terminator, we have Branches On The Tree Of Time.

** For whatever reason an AI sets out on an interstellar voyage with a huge number of people and although it can halt aging there's no way to halt mental processes over the ages without degradation so it needs a way to keep them stable. It also has an accurate log of the 21st century (perhaps it could be derived from all the footage and recordings?). As it is known to work and result in minds stable within the margin of error one is simply plugged into the other with some way to suppress memory.
