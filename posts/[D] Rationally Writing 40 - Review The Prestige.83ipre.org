** Spoilers ahead, my interpretation of Angier's motivation..

The first time Angier duplicated himself, "he" shot his "clone", as the clone yelled: "I am the origin-"

What if, the clone actually /is/ the original? Whatever truly happened during the moment of the duplication, only the two Angiers would know... Most would assume, a perfect, atom-to-atom duplication would produce two instances of the same person - with no way to tell them apart and the question to define the "original" is not meaningful.

However, one possibility is something happens during the duplication process, the two copies are /not/ identical. Both would know somehow, the original gets teleported away and a clone is produced at the original location. This, of course, is the not the most obvious mechanism one would expect.

This is why Angier shot his original in his first ever experiment - he knew he was the clone, therefore had a "lesser" right to exist, thus quick to resolve to desperate and drastic measures. This is also why he would go on perform the trick, knowing the one drowning in the tank would be the "clone", and he would live on as the original.

Of course, there is no evidence to actually support this hypothesis at all. However, even back to the model where the machine produces identical copies of the same person - the surviving Angier could not know for sure; he heard his-self yelling "I am the original" - an eternal seed of doubt forever remained in his mind. He had no way to answer the question definitively who's the "original" (to him this is not a mere philosophical question, but a life and death paradox).

In this sense I think he truly believed the brief words his first murdered clone spoke - that the clone is the original. After all, he /felt/ like the original when enjoying the awe and applause of the audience every night. Therefore, in his mind, what he was doing was a merciful murder of his clone every day, not a knowing suicide. I think this is likely the justification he gave himself. Given it has already been established that he did not like at all the double taking the glory and prestige earlier in the movie, I think the only plausible explanation for him to kill himself every day only to let a clone take all the glory is that he believed that the survivor was and would always be the original.

** Spoilers for the movie below:

My reading of Angier's clone murder played out something like this: rationally, there may be a lot of reasons that he shouldn't kill the clone. He does bring a gun along, but in the movie, his narration delivers the words "...taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation" exactly coinciding with the shot where we see him loading and placing the gun. (Knowing Nolan's attention to detail as a filmmaker, this isn't an accident -- the line's delivery exactly begins and ends with the start and end of the shot of him loading and placing the gun.) Again, consider the words "taking precautions:" the gun is a "just in case" measure; he probably hopes he doesn't have to use it.

At the moment he performs the duplication, the idea to kill the double using the gun he prepared may be only a possibility in his mind. As he stated, it's just a "precaution," he /probably/ isn't going to kill the double, but /maybe/ he has to, and surely these thoughts are on his mind as he stares at his double for the first time. But then, after he has the thought "it is possible that I might want to kill this man who looks exactly like me," another thought follows: if his first thought upon seeing "himself" was "maybe murder is something I might want/need to do," surely this possibility is also drifting through the clone's mind as well -- he KNOWS that the clone is capable of contemplating murdering him, because he's contemplating murder right now, and the clone is a copy of him. At this point, another thought logically follows. "My clone might be contemplating murder. Well, not if I kill him first, using this gun I conveniently placed here." But wait -- surely the double must also be thinking the same thing -- the clone is thinking to kill him before he can kill the clone! At this point, it becomes clear: as a matter of self-preservation, he MUST kill the double before the double kills him. The fact that the clone must be considering to kill him out of an identical sense of self-preservation only strengthens his resolve as he picks up the gun and fires it.

Angier sends himself into a vicious cycle where the more he considers killing the double, the more murderous intent he perceives in the double, which further increases his motivation to kill the double. In this way, by simply beginning from a position of, "maybe I'll bring a gun along, just in case things get out of hand," it quickly escalates to a position where Angier considers it absolutely necessary to kill the double.

I perceive Angier having a completely different set of motivations going into the stage trick where he drowns: He's unsure of whether he'll be the one drowning in the tank or the one receiving the prestige (something that we're explicitly told by his dialog). But perhaps his willingness to perform the trick is based on the fact that he considers both of these to be acceptable outcomes, on some level -- he'd obviously rather be the one receiving the prestige, but also consider the alternative: in the drowning scenario, he's effectively committing suicide, tying himself up and jumping into a water tank that no one can rescue him. Perhaps he's contemplated suicide many times before in the years since his wife drowned. Perhaps, throughout the years, the one thing that has constantly kept him from committing suicide is the fact that he wants to "beat" Borden, to get his "revenge" by being the more successful magician. In a way, the duplication trick allows him to experience both: he gets the release of death by drowning (much as his wife did -- in his mind, the death is a peaceful and painless process), but he also gets to perform an impressive trick far greater than Borden is capable of, and knowing that this is happening also allows him to die satisfied that, even in death, he is still "winning," and he doesn't even have to worry about the possibility of watching as his "double" receiving the prestige in his stead because in that scenario he'd be dead.

I sort of assumed the meaning of those precautions was that he thought the teleportation could leave him horribly maimed and due for a long suffering followed by death, in which case he wanted to have the means to end it quickly ready at hand. It's been years since I watched the movie though, so maybe I forget some detail.

*** Agree with your interpretation :) While I was editing it I actually was thinking that it makes the most sense that way, particularly due to the natures of risk-taker vs non-risk-taker.

**** Prestige, or the Story of Borden and Control.
