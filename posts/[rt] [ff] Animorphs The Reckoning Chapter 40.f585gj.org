**** I just finished reading through the whole series, this was my first chapter I had to wait on. So sorry if you have answered this in the past - where did the idea for the Garrett character come from? Was that based on some aspect of the original lore that I forgot? Or if not what led you to throw in a non-canon core team member, and one with such an unusual perspective at that?

***** So, there wasn't any one moment of inspiration, or anything like that. The thought process went something like:

- Tobias isn't going to be able to turn into a hawk, because of the changes I made to "rationalize" morphing tech.
- He's going to need something else to be his "thing" ... his character arc will be different.
- Oh, also, it's kind of weird that none of the Animorphs really had any outside connections, isn't it? Like, Melissa being Rachel's friend was kind of a big deal in canon for the first couple of books, but outside of that none of them seemed to have any other friends.
- Maybe Tobias is the one who has an outside friend.
- Oh, maybe Tobias's outside friend is another orphan.
- Oh, maybe it's an orphan that Tobias sort of looks after.

From there, I was sort of groping around for what their relationship ought to be like, and I sort of settled on "someone who contrasts strongly with Tobias's wariness and street-smarts; someone who at least at first blush is more open and trusting and maybe naive."

That led to a vision of, like, what their past history would have been like, with them having a mutual promise to get each other out of Oak Landing if possible and /that/ led to the idea of the blood brothers thing and /that/ led me to wonder what had gotten Tobias to pay attention to this kid in the first place and /that/ led me to "maybe he's weird." Like, maybe he's the kind of kid that /I/ would've ended up paying attention to and trying to protect?

And from "maybe he's weird" I just sort of ... cranked up several of my own weirdnesses by about 2-5x, and once I noticed that those weirdnesses clustered around the autism spectrum at least a little, I remembered THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT TIME and from there Garrett emerged.

He doesn't have much to do with the original lore, except insofar as, for its time, Animorphs was wildly diverse and accepting (interracial and interspecies couples, implied gay couples, direct look at divorce and remarriage, obviously the whole transformation thing) and so it felt pretty natural to lean a little bit into neurodiverse archetypes, especially since I knew I was going to be inside a lot of alien heads, too. Like, it felt right for "grown-up Animorphs" to have a Garrett, like if Animorphs had kept going or had been written in this decade it would obviously have a Garrett /somewhere./

****** Very interesting, thanks a lot!

Yeah Garrett definitely fits well with the general exploration of neurodiversity. The original Animorphs did a good job of exploring what it was like to be various animals, but from what I remember didn't really delve into the psychology of its alien species in the same way - they were all pretty much just humans, maybe with some minor differences like Hork Bajir being dumb, Taxxons being hungry, and Andalites having random savant-like abilities. You by contrast have done some very cool work with Yeerk and Andalite psychology in particular, which along with Garrett opens up the mental aspect of morphing in a fascinating way.

Looking forward to the next chapter!

  HELIUM'S eyes swiveled so that one was pointing at each of them.

  ‹Shorm,› he whispered.

  “What does that mean?”

  ‹It doesn't matter.›
#+end_quote

I struggled to parse this a little. He was looking at Marc0 and Jake, right?

Also, I was a bit thrown off by the usage of "Shorm". It didn't make sense for Helium to indicate friendship to either Marc0 or Jake at that moment. But then I remembered it meant someone you would trust to have a tail blade at your throat, which really is not the same thing as friendship at all.

I guess that's how they (Helium) feel right now. They'll have a tail blade at the throat of the planet - at the throat their very principals. And at that moment, they decide to trust Jake with that blade.

I love the way this whole series takes things, /does not/ change them, but reinterprets them slightly to mean something different. It's great.

Speaking of, I was a little confused as to how the other three Marcos are "listening in"? I assume it's something to do with Visser One being split among them, but has she developed a way to communicate with herself over long distances that I missed?

I was trying to imagine some complicated scheme involving the Marclones acquiring multiple layers of morph armor of each other, so they all have each other's control/interface tissue, but because the mind connected to each layer is exactly the same as the one in the physical brain, the interference is somehow coherent enough that V1/4 can make sense of it and figure out what the others are thinking.

** There isn't enough GARRETT in these ANIMORPHS! I say we need /two/ GARRETTS! No, /fifty/ GARRETTS!

I like how Garrett counts from 0. That is the correct number to count from. Also how he uses text-based puns in his internal monologue.

I can't help but wonder if they're actually willing to go through with it. It's one thing to know that if you're not willing to go through with it conditional on negotiations failing, you have no bargaining power. It's another for negotiations to fail, and to go through with it. I predict that some people would think in advance that they could do it, but when it came down to it wouldn't be able to. Even given that that doesn't mean the Earth is safe, it means V3 gets the Earth. And I expect V3 with a Leeran would be able to detect those people.

Maybe Jake can as well, if he morphs them and thinks to ask the question?

(There's none of them that I specifically expect not to be able to go through with it, but the question is worth asking in general.)

Given the stakes, I'm a little surprised that Jake is willing to bring Ante along based on Rachel's say-so. Obviously morphing him (and depending on timeframe, maybe Rachel) makes it less surprising. But I also feel like that /Right/ at the end was hinting at something that hasn't been revealed yet?

From the most recent Visser passage:

#+begin_quote
  /Without the Earth, completing the conquest of the rest of the galaxy will take five times as long, and be twice as likely---or more---to fail./

  He was suspicious of the thought---for being too reassuring, too convenient, for making him /feel better/ when he still did not understand the cause of his disquiet. But even in his suspicion, he /could not stop himself from believing it/. It simply seemed /true/.

So...what exactly is going on here? The main two options I see are that either Jake is making an error because he knows very little about the wider war, or else this is the result of Alloran managing to mess with the Visser. The first is pretty reasonable, if narratively disappointing. The second...how would Alloran even /do/ that? Inflated the importance the Visser sees Earth to have without any conscious memory of doing so?

Now that the two personalities are fully integrated, that idea persists and makes sense to the Visser in a way that he can't deny it, and isn't sure that it was Alloran who put the thought there.

Jake doesn't know any of this, of course, but he's figured out that the Visser really should have cut his losses and blown this popsicle stand by now. Especially after Telor's betrayal. But he hasn't, which means he wants Earth specifically for reasons unknown, hence Jake's half-a-plan.

*** This is more headcanon than word-of-god, but my current state of beliefs here is that the Arn successfully and accurately ported-over "Esplin on top of Alloran" into a new biology, but that since there literally is no more Yeerk anymore, you can't ever undo the joining.

Like if you photocopied two post-it notes side by side. The new sheet is its own thing, even if it preserves 100% of the information of the originals.

What this means is that Visser (unlike Esplin/Alloran) is now going to /continue/ to grow and change in a fashion much more like a human mind (two lobes at war with each other) rather than like a normal Controller pair.

** Oh boy, looks like Jake is making a huge mistake. V3 was already almost going to kill the earth - threatening it with destruction might just cause him to abandon it and let it be destroyed. Even after Garrett points this out, Jake doesn't address that underlying problem. He is just hoping he will think of something during negotiations. Anything they offer V3 either gets them killed instantly or in five years (seemingly; we will see perhaps). Hopefully Tobias can find them before then, so at least they will have a better bargaining position.

Other notes: Garrett is very interesting to read. Also, It was not clear to me whether they actually acquired each other at the end of this chapter - the way it was written, it sounded like everyone just ignored Garrett there at the end. (This fic leaves a /lot/ unsaid, sometimes too much, I think. I wonder how well I would comprehend it if I wasn't participating in reddit discussions every chapter.)

I'm with you here. As much as I love this fic, it's /extremely/ mentally demanding. I don't follow the Reddit discussions, and I have to pause a lot of times during chapters just to decode stuff. Occasionally I just fail, and I move on without understand some morsel of story. It doesn't make it any easier that the gaps between updates are fairly wide, and the chapters themselves have so much going on (just in terms of length but also in terms of how many threads they're juggling) it's hard to keep track of it all anyway.

On one of the Reddit threads I /did/ read a while back, the author said something about leaving more and more things up to the reader to figure out based on what's logical. There's a cynical side of me trying to point out that, in any other medium, that would be called having plot holes.

Overall though, I don't think I've ever missed anything important. I think the stuff that counts is in there, and if something isn't obvious when it's first "revealed", it's at least usually comprehensible after reading some more.

*** I think the "three minutes later" is meant to imply that they spent 90 seconds acquiring each other, and 90 seconds morphing.

** As seems to be the popular opinion, I'm always extra tickled by Garrett chapters, and his whole fibonacci sequence thing was particularly great. As is just all of his observations about others.

Also, I love Jake's idea, and extra love that it was pointed out that you need to actually be prepared to /bargain/ with your enemy in situations like this. It's far too common in fiction where people figure out a MAD-type threat and then the enemy just withdraws entirely, which sure, can happen if you find something they care about too, but most antagonists are more willing to engage in negative-sum trades than most protagonists, unless they're in unusually gritty fiction.

Ha! I do this all the time when a kid is tantrumming or seems to be ignoring me for too long. Not the cursing part, but like "Sooo is some part of you in there, or not right now? Blink twice if you want me to stay, three times if you want me to go away."

  “Wait,” I said. “Before we morph, we should all acquire each other again. We should do that all the time.”

Finally!

Really loved the chapter! Especially the unique, yet comprehensible perspective of Garrett, I find it really impressive that you're able to do different internal voices so well.

I feel very, very unconvinced by Jake's plan here - what kind of concessions could they possibly get out of V3 by threatening to destroy the one thing Jake cares about protecting?

It's worth noting that:

- Jake's parents and aunts and uncles are dead
- Cassie is dead
- Jake just watched Marco die three times and then stayed up for 24h straight

My intention was to show that he's teetering on the edge of "going too far" and that he's falling toward a literal "live free or die" attractor.
