Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I've been toying with the idea of writing a multiperson reincarnation isekai, with the gimmick being that all the people getting isekai'd are grand strategy fanatics of various stripes, being born as the heirs to various nations. (Either in a fantasy world, alt-earth, or earlier in earth's history.) Cue ridiculous jingoism shenanigans. That being said, I'm not sure how I'd sell this idea to an audience considering how ridiculously niche it would be. Does anyone have any marketing suggestions?

*** Maybe call it 'Tactics Cultivation Isekai'? Cultivation has a built in audience, if you pitch your thing as 'cultivation but tactics instead of punching' maybe you can tap into that. Isekai is currently a good buzz word, and you are doing that, so that goes in as well?

Publish on Sufficient Velocity and Space Battles in addition to Archive of Our Own, they love the grand strategy stuff over there.

I dunno, marketing is hard.

** OK so I ended up at a biology conference in London on the weekend and had a great discussion about vampires at the dinner.

Three main topics I thought would be interesting to discuss here:

*how dire is sunlight weakness?*

The person I was talking to was arguing that due to the very severe vampire weakness to sunlight, they're probably going to not live forever just because one day they'll lose track of time and wind up stranded in the sun and die. I countered saying that if sunlight is basically the one thing that can kill you, you'd be keeping track of time like a hawk (and mused that perhaps the prizes associated with getting accurate chronometers for ocean navigation were actually by vampires who wanted to know the time).

I then said that people with diabetes are able to eat and give themselves insulin in order to manage their blood sugar, which is much more finicky than something as regular and predictable as sunrise/sunset times, and it turned out my conversation partner actually had type 1 diabetes and proceeded to explain exactly how difficult it is and how frequent close brushes with death are with the condition, so you know. Maybe my analogy was not well-chosen.

*mental health: the vampire killer*

Then we got onto the subject of mental health. Young, otherwise healthy people tend to have death by suicide in the top 3 causes of death, and older people actually die by suicide at a greater rate[citation needed] but they die of cancer/stroke/etc more often so it goes out of the top 5 for that reason. Anyway, death by suicide is more common than death by murder, and vampire media is full of vampires murdering each other but doesn't really have vampires dying by suicide.

Would vampires die by suicide? I have heard it's often an impulsive thing, and when you can die by walking to the middle of a field and waiting for sunrise, or putting a stake through your own heart, or setting yourself on fire, those impulses can be deadly (see: the explanation for the high suicide rate in the US being related to gun ownership).

I don't think that you can argue that being a vampire makes you less prone to suicide because of your super powers or your age as older people die by suicide as well, and rich and powerful people do too (not sure about the relative rates).

Which brings us to....

*do vampires get mental illnesses?*

A standard vampire gets shot in the shoulder, you'll expect to see her wounds to knit together before your eyes as she rips the head off the fool who shot her. You don't expect her to catch a cold or the flu or smallpox or whatever. She's blessed in a state of perfect health.

So, mental illness has a physical cause: plaques in Alzheimer's, serotonin in a lot of other mental illnesses. Can a vampire heal that? Would a vampire turn his dementia-striken mother so that way she'll remember him again? If you have OCD and are turned, do you finally feel your anxiety go away and no longer have the need to turn the light switch 14 times every time you enter the room so your son doesn't get cancer?

If we say "of course your serotonin issues are fixed, mental illnesses aren't associated with perfect health", then, what, does anger get stopped because that's a mental "defect"? Does the brain stay in a constant state of stasis and you can't learn new things, can't form new memories?

Does the vampire magic heal you back to "original" - so your OCD/Alzheimer's/etc is considered to be "you" and is the state you heal back to? Lots of people with mental illness, most notably autism, consider that to be a part of their identity, after all.

Like, with the brain, and healing specifically, you've got a sort of scale of "physicality" in terms of the brain:

(physical brain damage as in like someone cut part of your head off with a sword) > (brain damage like someone punched you real hard) > (primarily physical brain illnesses like MS or Alzheimer's) > (mental illnesses with clear physical components like OCD and anxiety) > (temporary mental things like anger, sadness)

And I'm not sure where changing your personality as you grow in general or forming new memories or learning goes there, but....

*** Vampires in general likely get mental ilness, as there are plenty of ways that brains can be structured that are technically healthy but maladaptive for whatever social context they operate under. That being said, I'd expect vampires who were better at siring non-suicidal vampires to have more overall success, and pass their knowledge and ideology on to the vampires they sire in turn, so by the modern day I'd think most vampires would be "mentally healthy" in the sense that they'd be well adjusted for their lifestyle, but still extremely divergent from the usual human mental state. Which is unsurprising, considering most iterations of vampires are immortal. You probably wouldn't even be able to discern the behavioral adaptations that surround avoiding mental illness from all the other vampire weirdness.

*** I think that the major reason for age-related suicide is probably not the weight of years, but rather the onset of infirmity. The knowledge that your body can't do what it once could and /never will again/ may be one of the worst parts of growing old. And it's a thing that vampires do not have.

Which doesn't mean that vampires in general /won't/ suicide, of course; young people do it, after all. But there's another factor to bear in mind here, which is that vampires don't die of old age.

Consider this; assume that X% of new vampires (for some X) end up committing suicide, and (100-X)% have the sort of viewpoint - or perhaps the sort of mental stability - or a stubborn refusal to give up - or a fear of what's waiting for them after death - that completely prevents them from attempting suicide. If they were human, then (in time) that second group would die of other causes - cancer, old age, lightning strikes, whatever. This may not happen to vampires.

Over time - where 'time' is measured in millenia - those vampires who refuse to suicide will remain, while those who commit suicide won't. So, eventually, you'll have a whole lot /less/ than X% of /existing/ vampires who are potentially suicidal, simply because a big chunk of that X% took a stroll across a sunlit meadow at some point.

Eventually, it will look like vampires are less likely to be suicidal than the general population, even if they aren't.

It should be easy enough to cope with indefinitely if you're very cautious, since all that matters is that you're back before sunrise, but all you lose from being back early is some time (and hunting radius I guess.)

Also you could potentially break in somewhere when you see the sky start to lighten, if you don't have the "needs permission to enter" weakness.

Doesn't it? I feel like suicide is a pretty common theme in vampire media. Especially the more angsty/romantic Anne Rice-y side of it.

I know Twilight has at least one suicide attempt by Edward, and Buffy has at least one by Angel ... Buffy also has Spike dying via heroic sacrifice although I'm not sure that counts. (Very normie examples I know, I'm not really up on my Vampire media.) TVtropes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideBySunlight][has a page for it.]]

Suicide rates do vary by demographic, in unintuitive and poorly- understood ways.

The trouble with /population/ statistics is that suicide-ness varies much more between individuals than it does between populations, of course. Are there people so mentally healthy they have a 0% chance of becoming suicidal regardless of age?

Some fictional vampires seem /more/ prone to depression than humans. Vampire: the Requiem for instance talks a lot about how vampires can't feel real pleasure when not sucking blood, they feel dead inside and are just going through the motions.

** I've got an omnipotent deity that wants to destroy modern civilisation WITHOUT destroying humanity. It's really lazy, so it's not going to go the effort of deleting knowledge from people's brains or deleting fossil fuels out of the ground. The goal is a permanent industrial era technological stasis somewhere between 1880 and 1945.

It wants to change some of the universe's laws: that's the easiest way to achieve its goal.

So far I've come up with two changes:

Quantum mechanics is slimmed down massively: semiconductors no longer work. Say goodbye to all post-vacuum tube electronics.

Einstein's discoveries are severely crippled: No radioactive decay, uranium becomes a normal metal. Nuclear fusion stays to keep the sun lit. But you need fission to kickstart a thermonuke and I doubt a vacuum-tube civilization could get to sustainable fusion reactions considering how much trouble we're having.

If both of these changes were to happen tomorrow, is there any possible way for modern civilisation to re-emerge? I don't know whether it's possible to skip semi-conductors and make neural network processors. Do they need semiconductors?

Is there another simple change that would help preserve stasis?

** [[/u/MagicWeasel][u/MagicWeasel]]'s discussion on vampires reminds me of an idea of my own I like to tinker with.

Imagine a society where vampirism is a recognized condition, but instead of the traditional torches and pitchforks response, society at large recognized vampirism wasn't all bad--it was a mixed bag. Critical to my ideas on the setting is that vampires /require human blood to function./ For vampires to continue to exist, and for humans/mortals to tolerate them, they must sustain a large enough ratio of mortals/vampires that vampires can subsist on blood donations.

Now vampirism has a relatively well-defined limit. Both humans and vampires have a strong motive to keep vampire population from growing too rapidly. Vampirism is /in demand./

Obviously, there would probably be some who defer for ethical/religious reasons, but vampirism essentially represents immortality in peak form. The ranks of vampires would be expanded by skimming off the social elite, the cream of the crop. Being turned young indicates ambition, because you were accomplished enough in your youth to be inducted with little deliberation.

I guess the question would be, how does this class of remarkable immortals fit into society? Are the isolationists? Oligarchs? Feudal lords? Socialist utopia thinktank?

*** The movie Daybreakers deals with this. The film itself isn't super rational, but the premise is: Everyone wants to be a vampire because of super strength & eternal youth, so everyone gets turned & humans are in short supply. Most of the remaining humans (not very many) are kept in matrix-pod-esque blood farms, and all of vampire society is hugely concerned with developing an artificial blood substitute. Vampires can survive on animal blood, but not forever--going without it for too long turns them into feral, vicious beasts who will hunt and kill even other vampires.

It's a pretty good movie. Has some nice rational touches: cars with tint-shifting windows & 360 degree cameras for driving during daylight; all apartments being equipped with timed blackout curtains.

** Hopefully this has not been done already, but I am informed that the most recent Star Wars trailer shows our heroes riding some kind of horse analogs across the hull of a spaceship, possibly a star destroyer. I have satellite internet and my bandwidth won't tolerate actually watching the video, but I've seen the stills. Apparently there's evidence to suggest that the ship, and several ships around it, were on or under water at some point, rose out of the water, and are flying through atmosphere when the horse-riding occurs. Your mission:

1. Find a plausible and non-stupid way for all those horses to get onto the deck of a (presumed) star destroyer in atmosphere. You may assume the star destroyer was on or under the water, or over it, at the time of boarding. If the horses were previously inside the ship, you need a good reason for having them there and a way for them to get out.
2. Find a tactically sound reason for riding horses across the superior hull surface of an airborne star destroyer. Presumably they need to get to the other end of the hull really fast. Why?
3. For bonus points, explain why these enormous spaceships are operating in atmosphere, and why we did not see this done before, e.g. during the battle of Hoth in ESB. You do not have to account for the physical implausibility of this feat, or any other aspect of the situation, since this is Star Wars. Assume standard nonsensical SW physics apply.

You are allowed to use any further details gleaned from the trailer, or other trailers for Episode 9.

*** 1. The heroes are infiltrating the secret underwater base of the First Order. Keeping SDs underwater is good for stealth reasons, it's impossible to tell they're there from a quick scan of the system. Due to powerful First Order ECM and all the scopes a Star Destroyer would have, they can't use diving machines to get down there (and don't have any anyway). Instead they use the local wildlife which are perfect amphibians and great swimmers.

2. The horses aren't just fast, they're also jumpy. A Star Destroyer is full of protrusions, walls and valleys. You need superhuman jumping, climbing and so on to get anywhere on a Star Destroyer's surface. They're going to the other side to rescue a mcguffin, help an ally, bypass unstoppable numbers of stormtroopers, get to a hangar to escape... any number of reasons. I don't think a SD's guns could fire on them, it's probably much safer than fighting through the ship deck by deck.

3. The SDs are in atmosphere because they have no fear of surface-to-space attacks like on Hoth and/or need to precisely target their munitions on a stealthy or fast-moving ground target. It's the difference between bombers at 50,000 feet or doing close air support vs an enemy with no AA.

Why are my horses perfect amphibians and amazingly athletic in atmosphere? Well, they're genetically engineered to be that way by the scientists working on the planet. The Imperials/First Order have been working on a low-maintenance, highly adaptable and stealthy vehicle for infantry attacks ever since the AT-AT and AT-ST programs were shown to be incredibly bad in various ways. Super-space horses have a much better supply chain (they'll eat just about anything), heal in the field and are much cheaper than speeders. Ideal for long patrols and occupations on all kinds of different worlds, after you get past the incredible capital cost of the genetic manipulation.

**** I don't know whether to bring up the difficulties of swimming quickly with something on your back. On the one hand, SW doesn't concern itself with physics. On the other, it does concern itself with visual plausibility, and it would be hard to show realistic-looking horses swimming at very high (say dolphin-like) speeds while mounted. Most of us have experience swimming and know that water slows you down, and that it's easier to swim below the surface than on it. Similarly, they can only show them jumping so far before it becomes visually incredible (assuming the horses are not force-using, etc.).\\
I did forget to mention what AW brings up: they're apparently native organisms from the planet where this takes place. Doesn't mean they can't be super jumper super swimmers naturally, of course.

*** Per outside materials (Vanity Fair has a few articles), the horse creatures are orbacks, and a fair chunk of the movie takes place on Pasaana, where the orbacks are native, which has more climates on a planet than usual for Star Wars, including grasslands, desert, and oceans. That's all speculation at this point, but it would make a lot more sense to have a planet with multiple biomes than how Star Wars normally does it.

From there, you just need:

1. Ships operating in atmosphere and
2. Horses on the ships

Ships operating in atmosphere was shown in Rogue One, specifically a Star Destroyer parked in place directly above Jedha City, so that's not a huge leap. Why it's not done more often might need a little explaining, but there are lots of plausible reasons, including energy usage, maneuverability, available weapons, etc. A Star Destroyer parked in place above Jedha seems much more like a symbol or a power move to help keep the population complacent than it seems like it's tactically useful (pretty sure that's true of Star Destroyers in general, which a less symbol-conscious Empire would probably replace with lots of much smaller ships, though it's been a long time since I've done a deep dive on Star Wars canon).

So if you have a bunch of ships rising up from the water, maybe that's because they've been hidden or buried there, put out of active service and not just plopped into orbit or landed on some desolate moon for ... reasons, which would be easy enough to fabricate and depend on a bunch of technology and politics that you could just make up.

So that leaves the horses. There's a good reason to use horses instead of motorcycles or speeders or whatever: you don't have motorcycles or speeders or whatever. Or, if you do have speeders or whatever, you're not trained on them, and can't get enough training to make it worth it. Based off of stills released of the movie, this seems fairly likely to be the case, since they're mostly in the aesthetic of nomads. Star Wars is schizo tech, but you could look to cases of schizo tech on Earth for some justification. Horses were used in various capacities during WWII even by technologically advanced nations, for example. You could make this more sensible by making them better versions of horses, capable of better traction, movement, more responsive, smarter, etc. If the horses can't just walk onto the ship when it's getting close to taking off, then you can drop them with some (stolen?) cargo carriers, if you really want to.

**** But that's just it--if you have cargo carriers, you already have something superior to a ground-based horse for transport, no? They drop you off at one end of the ship, you ride across, and at the other end you're doing ... what? There's not a lot a bunch of guys on horses can do on the surface of a starship, and the stills don't seem to show them carrying anything heavier than hand weapons. Possibly they could sabotage that one ship with thermal detonators or equivalent widgets, since its weapons aren't designed to hit things running on its surface, but then they'd go down with it. And the trailer shows other ships in the background. If those are enemies, they're going to need to be picked up to repeat the stunt multiple times, and if the Resistance is so low-rent they're dependent on horse-sabotage to win battles, wow. If those are friends, their presence keeps the friendly ships from shooting the enemy ship they're on. If all ships are friends, including the one they're on, I don't know why they have to gallop so urgently around.

** There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plCScjvDOJM][video]] of the main theme of the Phantom of the Opera performed by the lead singer of Nightwish and the guy that plays the Dutch version of the Phantom that has gone kinda viral around here. Which got me thinking, what would a rational version of the Phantom of the Opera look like?

I'm basing this on having a passing familiarity with the songs and having seen the 2004 movie years ago, but iirc my primary issue was that the main character comes across as really dumb for not seeing (or ignoring) some very obvious red flags and that the Phantom is a creepy homicidal stalker that is obsessed with Christine, but the story kind of still wants us to see him as kinda sympathetic.

Both these issues seem very solvable in a ratfic. Thoughts?

*** Assuming we want to actually showcase cognitive skills and not just be a fix fic, a Phantom fic could be an interesting place to introduce things like deliberate practice, spaced repetition, formation of expertise, etc.

Like, the Phantom being a creepy homocidal stalker is basically the point of the story, I think "fixing" that is breaking it. The audience should be aware that the Phantom is a creepy homocidal stalker and still think that he's charismatic and hypercompetent and a tortured artist and he and his brilliant student Christine have amazing chemistry. Christine should motivatedly ignore some obvious signs of homocidal stalking because this is also the point of the story, but the audience should understand her feelings and be proud of her growth as she begins to outstrip her teacher.

Speaking of point of the story, this could also be an interesting place to talk about how Christine might learn to notice and escape this metaphor for domestic violence by using real cognitive techniques. Would a fellow singer notice her changed behavior? How could they intervene / what resources could they point Christine towards?

Obviously this all sounds terribly hard to write and could be crap.
