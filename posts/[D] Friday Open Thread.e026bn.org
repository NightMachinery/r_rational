Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

Yep, and low risk of death as an occupational hazard. However, it won't give you much exercise, so you'd need to make sure you're engaging in regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The 'minimum' amount as a basic standard of self-care is 15 minutes per day, while the optimal range is 45-75 minutes per day. This appears to be something that can be done intensively during the weekend or spread out as an actual daily average, but there may be less risk of musculoskeletal injuries if it's done every day.[[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78910513.pdf][1]] Stationary bikes or elliptical machines are very gentle on your joints, so they'd be a good choice to help reduce risk of osteoarthritis.

Having a firm understanding of human anatomy, physiology, health and medicine are probably a good thing if you're trying to stay alive as long as possible. Of course, a lot of what you might see in a medical degree will not be applicable to you. For example, you almost certainly will never need to know about congenital illnesses, like ventricular septal defects. On the other hand, while you might not need to know about uncommon diseases like mesothelioma, understanding the risk factors for them could help you to avoid them. Meanwhile, diet, nutrition, exercise, hygiene, and dental care are all basic self-care activities where any persistent failures will lead to some of the most common diseases with the highest national death tolls. You should have an extremely firm understanding of these and should be extremely diligent to handle them appropriately.

The basic summary is to regularly exercise, minimize or eliminate saturated fat in your diet (butter and the animal-based fats found in meat and dairy), make sure you're getting plenty of fiber (which helps to lower your cholesterol, and you should be getting your cholesterol checked annually), and diet as needed to maintain an appropriate body weight. You should know the appropriate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index#/media/File:BMI_chart.svg][weight range for your height]] and stay within it. There are no PID controllers for dietary intake, but essentially you can either adjust your daily caloric limit up or down based on your weight, or you can engage in intermittent fasting as needed, whichever works best for you. Make sure to get a good full-body workout when dieting because otherwise you will lose some muscle mass along with fat.

- Make sure you're getting an annual physical exam and discussing any health concerns with your doctor.

- Minimize unnecessary driving, so try to live quite close to your workplace or anywhere else that you regularly need to travel.

- Mentally discard the food pyramid. Fruits and vegetables are great, try to make them the bulk of your diet. Grains, breads, and starches appear are okay, but don't make them the bulk of your diet. Meat and dairy are okay in small portions, but definitely try to minimize the fat (e.g. low fat milk, and cooking off or cutting out fats on servings of meat). Avoid sugary beverages and try to keep sugar intake to less than about 5% of your total caloric intake.

- Keep periodically looking up the latest guidelines on diet, exercise, and dental hygiene recommendations because research is ongoing and best practices are practically guaranteed to evolve throughout your lifespan.

- Avoid meats preserved with nitrites like jerky and hot dogs (check the packaging). These increase your risk of colon cancer. Similarly, avoid burned meats.

- Don't smoke or quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.

- Wear sunscreen if you're going to spend any significant amount of time in the sun.

- Always wash your hands before touching your food or placing your hands into mucous membranes like those around your mouth, eyes, and nose. If you get a cold, you probably fucked up on your hand hygiene and accidentally put a small amount of someone else's mucus in your mouth. Don't assume things are clean. Pay close attention because poor hand hygiene can potentially get you other diseases like norovirus or a potentially fatal strain of flu. Infections can also lead to secondary diseases, like type 1 diabetes which, in the uncommon case of adult-onset, appears to develop from an autoimmune response following an infection.

- Make sure your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are currently working and put their expiration dates on your calendar.

- Don't leave your stovetop unattended when cooking.

- Do not throw accelerants on a fire, and minimize usage of accelerants if you need to start a fire.

Some of these may seem more like they prevent discomfort or disease rather than death, but keep in mind the cascading effects of health problems. Small problems can easily escalate if they aren't prevented or properly addressed. Type 1 diabetes won't kill you outright, for example, but it will almost certainly shorten your lifespan significantly because your odds of being able to keep up with the treatment regimen flawlessly for your entire life are slim-to-none. Getting osteoarthritis from being rough with your joints may not kill you, but it will make it less likely that you can continue to tolerate doing the daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that you need to minimize risk of cardiovascular disease, which would also shorten your lifespan. There's tons of other points to consider, but this is a good list to start with.

For example, tons of recent studies have shown that there's no correlation between consumption of saturated fats and heart disease. Fats are fine. Fats have always been fine, as has the dietary cholesterol found in things like eggs. The problem is sugar, and has always been sugar.

EDIT:

Fiber has no nutritional content. You /must/ include fiber and roughage for digestive health. But for all intents and purposes, when looking at nutrition there is only protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Telling people to minimize meat and fat while making fruits and vegetables the majority of their diet would mean telling people to make carbohydrates their main source of calories. Most of the calories in fruit come from sugar. Vegetarians and vegans eat a lot of beans, not just fruits and vegetables. Carbs should be a maximum of 50% of your daily calories. 33% protein, 33% fat, 33% carbs would be perfectly valid. Telling people to minimize or eliminate fat from their diet is /atrociously/ terrible advice.

***** "Tons of studies" sounds good, but it really isn't good evidence. You can cherry pick almost any conclusion with "tons of studies." What you should rely on is a systematic review of all of the published evidence available.

Here's my [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44338362/Reduction_in_saturated_fat_intake_for_ca20160402-19341-16a4svk.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DReduction_in_saturated_fat_intake_for_ca.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20191122%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191122T184711Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2dc8bfc890211a5df06bac30a437a78db3cbd9136eb37a029d7a6c509e6c77b2][reference]]. Note that this is a systematic review of published research. To quote the authors' conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  The findings of this updated review are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohydrate appears less useful, but effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat were unclear due to inclusion of only one small trial. This effect did not appear to alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.
#+end_quote

For [[https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801?papetoc][another systematic review]] (which addresses food groups like fruits, vegetables, in contrast to red meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages, but not sugar specifically):

#+begin_quote
  Optimal consumption of risk-decreasing foods results in a 56% reduction of all-cause mortality, whereas consumption of risk-increasing foods is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality.
#+end_quote

As for guidelines regarding sugar itself (as opposed to sugary beverages), a [[https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2593601/scientific-basis-guideline-recommendations-sugar-intake-systematic-review][systematic review]] finds:

#+begin_quote
  Guidelines on dietary sugar do not meet criteria for trustworthy recommendations and are based on low-quality evidence. Public health officials (when promulgating these recommendations) and their public audience (when considering dietary behavior) should be aware of these limitations.
#+end_quote

So, basically, current recommendations do advise against substantial sugar intake, and the evidence taken as a whole appears to likely lean that direction as opposed to unrestricted sugar intake, but it's still weak evidence and further research is needed to determine if the data really supports the extent of the current recommendations. However, sugary beverages have been well-established as harmful by systematic reviews, like the one I mentioned above, so recommendations against sugar in general will hopefully help to reduce their consumption while we sort out the evidence.

Overall, dietary recommendations are tricky because it's impossible to run double-blinded randomized-controlled trials comparing different diets, and even high-quality cohort studies are challenging when it comes to diets. As such, the evidence for many diet recommendations is somewhat weak, and there tends to be many conflicting results. With that in mind, the best approach with dietary guidelines is to follow recommendations made by systematic reviews, particularly when they find at least moderate evidence of significant differences in all-cause mortality.

****** That is indeed probably the best study on the subject at the moment. It found that people who reduced their saturated fat intake were just as likely to die (or have heart attacks or strokes) as people who ate more saturated fat, but that replacing /some/ saturated fats with unsaturated fats /might/ reduce the risk of cardiovascular /events/ (but /not/ death, heart attacks, or strokes). That could very well be less to do with the reduction in saturated fats per se than with that reduction making room for an increase in unsaturated fats.

Exactly. So maybe it's not the best idea to make blanket statements like "try to eliminate saturated fats from your diet" when most recent evidence points towards trans fats and sugar being the worst things you can consume. It could easily turn out that cardiovascular exercise has the greatest effect on cardiovascular health. That meta analysis specifically excluded studies with a multifactorial intervention, meaning exercise wasn't considered at all. "Having high cholesterol" isn't inherently bad, you have "high cholesterol" when your veins/arteries/whatever harden and start to crack because your body is using cholesterol to try to patch up the cracks in your veins. Maybe it's going to turn out that it's far less important to reduce saturated fats / lower your cholesterol than it is to prevent your arteries from hardening in the first place.

This is not what they found. They stated "...but effects on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 12 trials, 55,858 participants) ... were less clear (both GRADE moderate quality of evidence)." (Pages 1-2), as well as, "There was some evidence that reducing saturated fats reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 11 trials, 53,167 participants)"

They did find reduced incidence of fatal heart attacks, and potentially reduced incidence of all-cause mortality. As the authors state on page 2 regarding their findings, this is "suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake."

#+begin_quote
  ...or strokes...
#+end_quote

Agreed, no evidence of difference there.

#+begin_quote
  That could very well be less to do with the reduction in saturated fats per se than with that reduction making room for an increase in unsaturated fats.

Sure, that's a definite possibility. Of course, if the recommendation to consume less saturated fat is reducing fatal heart attacks through that mechanism, that would still mean that it's a good idea to tell people to eat less saturated fat.

#+begin_quote
  Exactly. So maybe it's not the best idea to make blanket statements like "try to eliminate saturated fats from your diet" when most recent evidence points towards trans fats and sugar being the worst things you can consume.
#+end_quote

First, this does not follow. Reducing intake of saturated fats and reducing intake of sugar are not mutually exclusive, it's entirely possible to recommend avoiding both. In fact, I did also mention limiting intake of sugar in my post, so I'm not sure why you're even addressing this to me.

Second, the authors specifically state "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear." I didn't get into details with unsaturated fats since the post was long enough already, but minimizing intake of saturated fats as I discussed is to be recommended according to this systematic review of the available evidence.

Third, I would like to see the systematic review which "points towards trans fats and sugar being the worst things you can consume." I don't need to a see a review on trans fats, I think everyone is on fully board with getting rid of them, but if you've got strong evidence in a systematic review regarding the impact of sugar, I would be thrilled to see it. (Not saying I think otherwise; I agree that sugar is likely harmful, but I would like to read that study if you've got it.)

#+begin_quote

*** Spread awareness that the Dragon-tyrant can be killed. We still live in the pre-debate era, when people just quietly assume that Dragon-tyrants are unstoppable laws of nature rather than killable beasts. It is this submissiveness to the Dragon-tyrant which gives it power these days, rather than any fact about itself.

Not enough people have hope. They still assume linear human advancement timelines despite all the obvious evidence of exponential growth. They don't remember how very different things were even ten years ago, and they don't realize that massive difference is going to propagate forward even more rapidly.

You won't survive, none of us will, unless we can get enough people on board with killing the Dragon-tyrant. They won't fund the research, won't vote for politicians who will fund the research, if they don't believe it has a chance of working. Just yesterday, the top post in [[/r/showerthoughts]] was an assumption that dementia will still exist in 50 years, and I was the only person in the whole thread who tried to point out this may not be the case. The OP even pushed back, saying the human brain was obviously way too complicated for us to have a fix for dementia in only 50 years! That is not the attitude of a society which believes it can kill Dragon-tyrants.

Nothing you or anyone else can do is more important than spreading the word. Nobody wants to die, and the only counterexamples exist due either to treatable illness (physical or mental) or because death has already claimed too much of what they loved. Almost nobody, except this community, realizes this means the problem is death, rather than lack of acceptance for death. The only way to fix that is to put it in people's heads that there really, actually might be hope, if only they reach out for it.

Those are not "other" priorities, those are /top/ priorities.

If you smoke, cease and desist. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death.

Decrease your consumption of red meat, because colon cancer / colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death.

If ye be female, breast cancer is in the top five causes of cancer death, so get that shit checked out.

[[https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer][Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to the 5 leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use.]]

So [[https://scoobysworkshop.com/accurate-calorie-calculator/][figure out how many calories you should be eating per day]] and [[https://www.myfitnesspal.com/][start tracking that shit]], try to add some frozen broccoli or frozen mixed vegetables into your diet at least twice a week and a banana (or maybe like an apple or something, though I see no reason why anyone would ever choose to consume any fruit that was not a banana) maybe like three times a week, walk at a moderate pace for thirty minutes two or three times a week, lift weights three times a week, and avoid tobacco and alcohol.

You could start taking [[https://examine.com/topics/colorectal-cancer-risk/][a daily vitamin D supplement and a daily panax ginseng supplement]].

Heart disease is the leading cause of death (in the US). Preventative measures are diet and exercise.

Cancer is the second. Diet and exercise are important preventative measures, as well as not exposing yourself to carcinogens.

Accidents are next. Accidents are hard to avoid. Wear a seat belt. Don't drive while intoxicated or sleep deprived. In theory, diet and exercise (with their effect of improving neurological health) can probably improve your ability to focus and to react. [[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2018/01/09/workplace-fatalities-25-most-dangerous-jobs-america/1002500001/][You can choose not to become employed in dangerous professions.]] According to the Electrical Safety Foundation International, contact with / exposure to electric current is the sixth most common cause of workplace fatality. So as an electrical engineer idk wtf you actually do but perhaps be a stickler about workplace safety.

The next is chronic lower respiratory diseases. Yet another reason to not smoke.

Stroke. Diet and exercise.

Dementia. If nothing else kills you and you "die of old age," statistically you've probably died of dementia. Exercise helps preserve the white matter that deteriorates/shrinks as a result of dementia.

Diabetes. Type I is unavoidable. Type II can be prevented through diet and exercise.

The flu and pneumonia. Don't have a weak immune system (diet and exercise) and go to the flipping hospital if you have pneumonia, don't just trust your body to fix it.

(EDIT: Never consume any sugarwaters like tea or soda or juice. If you simply /must/ consume coffee and/or energy drinks, then /don't consume energy drinks/ and take your coffee without sugar. Your body gets all the sugars it needs from the carbs you eat.)

Stress is an important factor in a lot of things (cancer, heart attack and stroke, probably other things). Focus on [[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better][improving the quality of your sleep]] and consistently getting between 7-and-a-half and 9 hours of sleep every night. (EDIT: If you're consistently getting an appropriate amount of uninterrupted sleep and still feel like shit in the mornings, consider that maybe that isn't normal and something might be wrong - maybe you have sleep apnea, or maybe you're using a high loft pillow or a low loft pillow when you should be using the other, or maybe you lay on your back/side when you should be laying on your side/back.) Cut negative people out of your life, ruthlessly. End any friendships you might have with people who have (or seem to have) Cluster B personality disorders. If you have a toxic work environment with a bunch of busybodies who socialize like they're in middle school and a boss whose identity is bound up with his absolute dominance of his employees then - if you can't abandon that job for a better job - learn how to detach and not take things personally and don't think about work at home. Supplementing with Ashwagandha root has been shown to reduce cortisol levels by almost 20%. (EDIT: [[https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/related-illnesses/other-related-conditions/stress/physical-activity-reduces-st][Exercise is relevant here as well.]])

In your personal struggle to live as long as possible (because, let's be real here, there's a high probability that you (and that goes for every person reading this, not just [[/u/Standard-Interest]]) aren't going to contribute in any meaningful way to the cause of ending death (and you can "spread awareness" as much as you want, but most people in this country are Christians and will dismiss your silly transhumanism out of hand (and might react to your problematic transhumanist beliefs by trying to "spread awareness" at you about the importance of The Jesus), and most of the people who you /could/ reach are being reached more effectively by [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY][people who already have a platform]] (that video has over 5 million views))), diet and exercise are going to account for more than 85% of your efforts towards maximizing your survivability. You could dig a bunker under your house and stockpile canned goods and water and whatever in case of nuclear war. Idk how the hell "learning the legal and medical systems" is supposed to contribute to extending your life. You could learn how to set a broken bone in case civilization collapses and you no longer have access to medical care. But so what? If civilization collapses, life extension immediately becomes "no longer a real thing," the defeat of the dragon is 100% contingent on civilization not collapsing.

TL;DR: Just lift some weights, bruh.

*** One thing that I haven't seen mentioned, in the fight against the dragon-tyrant's personal effects rather than its wider reach, is social networking. In the physical, old-fashioned sense, rather than the digital one.

Make friends. Have a lot of people around you who you enjoy spending time with and conversing with. Tell them your secrets. Make physical contact.

For one thing, we're social creatures, and it's unhealthy to try to exist in complete isolation. For another, trusted friends can hold you accountable to your priorities: even knowing that someone /knows/ that you're trying to get to the gym each week is a good motivator to keep doing it.

Loneliness leads to depression, and depression is one of the dragon-tyrant's loyal servants. Don't let it get ahold of you.

***** There's basically two things to think about in terms of cryonics / neural cryobiology research that might take place (but won't necessarily) in the near future.

One is that we could achieve marginally better cryonics than at present. Since it's an uncertain bet, this translates to better odds. Therefore, as a community, cryonics-interested people have incentive to coordinate towards this.

The other thing to think about is that we might uncover a way to achieve reversible cryopreservation for humans. This is actually a radically different idea from cryonics, since cryonics invokes the prospect of new technology in the future that repairs the patient and makes it possible to wake them. Reversible cryopreservation would involve preventing the damage to begin with, which makes it much less inherently speculative and more analogous to normal medical procedures.

I think people who are highly skeptical of old-school cryonics (who don't foresee a post-singularity or 300-year-from-now intelligence ever being able to reverse the damage) ought to agitate for funding of research to achieve reversible cryopreservation, i.e. how to prevent cryopreservation damage in the human brain. The main (near term) competition to this track is antiaging research, so it should come down to which of these is likely to advance the most quickly.

The issue with antiaging that anticryodamage doesn't have is the validation time. You can validate an approach in mice, which have short lifespans, but their biology is likely to diverge significantly from human biology precisely where things affecting their lifespan is concerned. Whereas mice and humans die when frozen(vitrified)/thawed(in the non-advanced-future-tech context) for the same basic reasons. An approach that prevents fundamental issues like cryoprotectant toxicity and cell shrinkage ("dehydration") in mice, rabbits, pigs, etc. should translate to humans, provided it can be scaled to our brain size.

Furthermore, when you get it to the stage of testing in humans (i.e. validated to be able to thaw large mammals like pigs), you know whether the human test subjects were benefited by a given change in the treatment much more quickly (did it kill the patient, and if so, how bad does the damage look under an electron microscope). This is much more in line with how we test drugs and surgical treatments in medicine today -- with only a few terminally ill people taking the bulk of the risk, and it being relatively safe by the time it is used on a large population. With antiaging, you have a very slow validation mechanism. Pretty much anyone over a certain age is doomed to end up either a test subject with very little certainty of success, or a control who dies of aging in the typical manner.

Of course, damage-free cryopreservation wouldn't be very valuable if you didn't cure aging eventually. But the main point of uncertainty isn't whether it can be cured (it's pretty much inevitable, assuming research continues long enough), but whether it will happen in any of our lifetimes. This is in stark contrast to the prospect of the reversal of the damage in (current-day/high-damage) cryonics, which not only depends on extremely advanced capabilities, but on unresolved questions of physical possibility (i.e. that the data in the brain is not "securely erased", but can be recovered).

Cryonics is a bet, to be sure, but it is not pseudoscience (as the term is usually defined).

And while I suppose anything can be described as an industry, it's a bit strange to see a loose coalition of nonprofits and enthusiasts described this way without context.

Ideally, by the time the OP needs cryonics he'll see it integrated into the standard medical pipeline, although even then it'll probably be considered a niche product for hardcore immortalists.

You use the word 'freezing' multiple times without clarification. Could it be that you haven't researched this enough to know that cryonics attempts to vitrify things instead of freezing them? I'm aware that sometimes freezing is employed as a colloquialism for cryopreservation in general, but you ought to at least try to signal awareness of this important physical distinction if you want to be taken seriously.

#+begin_quote
  First, through the fundamental assumption that identity/consciousness can be retained through freezing.
#+end_quote

No, the assumption that identity can in principle be preserved by freezing (if by that you mean cryopreservation in general) is not fundamentally baseless. It's the most reasonable way of looking at things in the light of known science, and no more controversial than humans being able in principle to travel to other planets. Surprising new science would be needed to discover that it can't be done, and it would have to be consistent with measured results (such as C elegans learned behavior surviving vitrification).

#+begin_quote
  Even setting aside the issue whether the collective state of neurons can be inferred from a static model of them, current cryonics procedures are likely to cause irrecoverable damage to cells.
#+end_quote

Long term memories are encoded in durable structures. Nobody who knows anything about neuroscience has serious doubts about that. It also fits with common sense -- the body is a chaotic environment, and it wouldn't make sense for memories to be stored in an overly volatile medium, as this would increase the amount of energy expended to keep making copies, and would reduce the organism's ability to reliably make decisions on the basis of memories. Short term memories and ongoing consciousness are a different story, and you can lose those pretty easily due to shock, anesthesia, etc. even without cryonics.

As to irrecoverable damage, how are you applying that label? In chemistry we talk about irreversible reactions, but that does not preclude all possible mechanisms to reverse the reaction, it just describes thermodynamics in a solution. Brain cells are likely to be dehydrated in current cryonics, which means if you add water they quickly undergo apoptosis and necrosis, making them unrecoverable by normal biological means, but if you have advanced simulations and scanning capabilities this could well be a very recoverable state by that standard.

#+end_quote

It's a gamble, but those aren't independent variables and don't have low individual likelihood. Tech progress does specialize, but there tend to be overlapping threads. For example, a world where aging is cured will more likely have cancer cured, because both of these rely on unraveling many of the same basic mysteries. But it is also because the kind of work to be done requires a lot of heavy computational modeling. Computational modeling is such a general purpose advantage across many fields that it is hard to imagine a world where advances occur in e.g. particle physics but not medicine, or vice versa.

Also, computational modeling has a history of becoming dramatically cheaper and more effective to use. So the same thing that boosts the chance of the basic tech ability developing boosts the chance of it being "commercially viable" (i.e. the funding available being adequate to do the thing). You don't have to be that optimistic about the Singularity to see this happening. Even if we are approaching the limits of Moore's Law, there are advances in more optimal deployment (custom chips that handle workloads better, more efficient algorithms, etc), and even when we hit those there is the advent of space based mining/manufacturing/computing to consider. We may never truly hit post-scarcity, but what the heck else do you want to /do/ with 10^{26} watts when you build your first Dyson swarm? Bear in mind that this takes <100 years if you have an annually self doubling system.

#+begin_quote
  AND C) whatever cryonics company they put their lot in won't go belly up before A and B happen.
#+end_quote

I don't think this is particularly likely. Part of it is the high likelihood that extreme advances will come quickly enough that they don't have to account for very many generations. And life extension may contribute to organizational stability. Another thing to consider is that cryonics organizations are basically ideologically driven, which gives them a better chance of surviving than profit driven companies. They are a little more like religions in that respect. One thing to consider is that they may hand patients off to another organization to take care of in the event of failure, and there may even eventually be legal protections forcing them to do so (certainly there are already community norms and ethics encouraging such to happen, as my understanding is that it has happened a few times already). Another factor is that they have the advantage of being on the "right side of history", meaning that when deathism falls out of fashion and e.g. cryopreservation becomes a routine medical procedure, cryonics will have broader societal support (and cryopatients will likely be viewed as priceless pieces of history, an irreplacable opportunity to extend living memory back to the 20th century). This increases the chance that such organizations will be able to successfully raise funds, or find suitable successors in the event of failure.

#+begin_quote

The surface plausibility of cryonics on scientific grounds is many orders of magnitude higher than anything overtly mystical or religious. And while I enjoy reading fantasy, I don't think the chance of us living in a secretly supernatural universe (let alone one where the bishop coincidentally has the power to sell effective indulgences) is high enough for this comparison to be at all reasonable.

Maybe recommending someone wait for better quality services would be defensible on the grounds of sending a sane and sensible market signal, but that is not at all how "cryonics is a pseudoscience" comes across. Instead, you are making a broad attack that is more likely to thwart than spur the additional research that could save your life one day. I would recommend rethinking your approach in terms of how to talk about this.

- Draw a circuit diagram for what you're trying to do before building the circuit.
- Refer to said diagram often during the circuit building process
- Before connecting the power (I assume you're building circuits on breadboard), run through the entire circuit against the diagram. Follow /every/ path from the power source's positive terminal through to ground, and check /every/ component along that path.
- After doing so, check that your circuit works as required before submitting it for marking.

** I'm mad about the Worth the Candle criticism thread. The author reads every post here and I know from past comments he takes criticism more seriously than (in my opinion) he should.

I'm not saying people should not be critical of any work, in any medium. God knows I've talked a lot of shit about countless works and been absolutely vicious about it, but never directly to the author and most importantly never /in the middle of the project/ while he or she was still working on it.

What I'm saying is like... Dickens for example was one of the first people to do episodic fiction and would do a chapter a month and then reprint it all in book form when it was finished. And I'm sure he took a lot of criticism mid work, because not everything is to everyone's taste, and that's fine. I'm sure he got some mean letters about how Oliver's character was cliché and the orphan-who-actually-has-rich-parents trope is overused, and he just crumpled them up and threw them in the hearth or lit his cigar with them. But Dickens didn't have a local pub where he went to where the room was magically big enough that /every person/ who was reading his current work was in there, and that enchanted pub didn't have a spell effect that caused every conversation /at any time/ in which people were critical of aspects of his writing and current work to be brought to his attention and listened to regardless of if it took place while he was asleep or not in the pub so that he could listen to every criticism that had ever been uttered there at his leisure. If it did have those things I would hope that Dickens, to preserve his goddamn sanity, would never set foot in that accursed pup while he was in the middle of a project. And some authors can operate like that, but others have to hear every negative word, in fact for some people the negative stuff is something they can't help but seek out.

Again, I'm not against criticism. I am intensely critical of much, in fact honestly most, of modern works of fiction in virtually every medium. I run my mouth all the time. But I love WtC and I don't want him to change anything. And I think internet criticism of /currently developing/ works is unhealthy. If in the history of art for example, authors/artists had had access to all negative comments/arguments about the work they were currently /in the middle/ of creating then the landscape of art would have ended up looking significantly different, and probably a lot worse.

You are talking as if people are coming out of nowhere to thrash works that have never been discussed and spamming the sub. This has never happened (or you've modded it away well). The *actual* issue(s) we are talking about are closer to people discussing what they disliked in works that people here are familiar with and recommending. 'Opening the floodgates' is not what's happening and you framing it that way is somewhat disingenuous. Would people be upvoting all those supposed negative posts to visibility, at all if they are so low effort?

Commenting or analyzing a work that's dropping in quality, or asking for recommendations and giving examples of what you dislike are forbidden? What if an author suddenly becomes very religious and turns a work in a weird direction - you can't make a comment on it? Or if I am analyzing tropes or directions in rational fiction - I should only list the ones I like, and not mention any I might be less keen on? What if a new chapter of a beloved work has many continuity errors for the first time, and in my confusion, I want to discuss it with others who read it - I can't?

We have voting here, if people hate it others are unlikely to see it. If the post is literallly 'X is shit', yes mod it away. But that's not what we are talking about and this blanket policy you are describing is at best only good for some of the authors that frequent the sub and bad for readers and everyone else. If your argument is 'yes but those authors are more important' that might have some merit but please say that so we can discuss it directly.

And, I get that the post was about you, and maybe you are still offended in some way. That sucks, but 1. The discussion was valuable for many. 2. The discussion was filled with positive comments and explanations why people like the things the op disliked, or how they misunderstood.

I don't have anything against you as a mod, I also love your work, and I see how negative comments can be stressful - but your comment here makes me think that maybe the community has just been unfair to you to have you as mod. You are one of the more prolific authors here, if negative statements about your work hurt you but you have to read everything - then that's not a great situation for you, I admit. Maybe instead we should add a warning for authors to read comments only at their own discretion?

Historically, people will upvote utter dogshit posts if the discussion below them is good. This doesn't mean that utter dogshit posts are in and of themselves good, just that sometimes good discussion can come from them. In the past, this wasn't criticism of any kind, rather, someone posting 'rational X?' with no thought or elaboration, and someone else taking a dozen paragraphs to flesh out the idea, give it some potential narrative structure, and add interesting ideas. I know this, because I was one of those people who would put in the actual effort on low effort posts.

(We did away with those posts for the most part, both by creating the Writing/Worldbuilding threads, which those posts get directed to, and by modding them away. (It's my belief that aside from power users, most people just pick up the culture by seeing what other people have been posting and then doing that, which means that if you have a lot of visible low quality posts, people will be encouraged by example.))

I think the discussion /was/ valuable for many, but the initial post, taken by itself, /probably/ wasn't, especially because "should I keep reading" posts are generally very low value for anyone but the person asking, and a lot of the stuff in that post was low-effort (and factually incorrect in places). Good discussion beneath a poor main post doesn't magically make that main post worthwhile. The post is currently at 61% upvoted, which is really low, but there might be any number of reasons for that, and I won't take that as being (necessarily) indicative of its quality.

If you want to talk about edge cases, then we could talk about edge cases, but what I said above was that this isn't the place to make top level posts about works you don't like. To rephrase, it's not the place to vent about stuff that bothers you in whatever work you read, it's a place that /primarily/ exists to recommend and discuss the best works of rational and rational-adjacent fiction. That's my view of what this subreddit is best at, and I'll mod with that in mind. I think that it could very easily become a place where people just endlessly bitch about flaws in works, but that strikes me as being really low value, and something that you could do in a dozen other places on the web. I think there's some value in de-recommending works, but the place for that is pretty small, and in my ideal scheme, that place would be almost exclusively as comments on posts rather than as posts themselves. If you can't find a place to make that comment because no one is talking about the work, then your comment probably doesn't direly needed to be posted (and we have both the recommendation threads and the open threads, if it really must be said to someone). Yes, this gives the subreddit a positivity bias, but it's not a big one. And you're perfectly well allowed to say what you didn't like, so long as that's not the /point/ of your post. (FWIW, I think the post in question should definitely have gone into the recommendation thread.)

  But that's not what we are talking about and this blanket policy you are describing is at best only good for some of the authors that frequent the sub and bad for readers and everyone else. If your argument is 'yes but those authors are more important' that might have some merit but please say that so we can discuss it directly.
#+end_quote

I mostly don't think about the authors that much, except for the noobies that are posting their first work (who should be gently nurtured in most cases, rather than shat on for their inevitable missteps, and who are much more responsive to feedback of any kind than, for example, me). I much more think about the community and what repels or attracts different people from or to it, so far as I can actually tell such things. It's my belief that we can have a better community by trying our best to focus on the positives rather than the negatives, and when dealing with negatives, to be careful about phrasing and tone, /especially/ if you're talking about a work that's popular around here. I think that's a form of conduct that creates the least strife, makes for the most cohesive community, and universalizes well. Partly this is because the subreddit serves many roles, one of which is for fans of certain works to discuss them; having someone come in and shit in the punch bowl is to be avoided as much as possible, because it infringes on the sub's ability to serve as that (via mild flame wars, soaking up time on arguments of taste, bad feelings, and evaporative cooling).

For me, the comments made by the parent poster in that thread weren't the worst I'd ever read, just annoying in how they cast the work, the general lack of citations, the things it got wrong, the lack of charity, etc. I pretty regularly have people leave reviews or comments telling me that I'm a failure as a storyteller, that the world is worse for the work that I've put into it, and a few times, that I should kill myself. I gets me down, and I junk quite a few messages without reading because it feels like a coin flip between, 'this work meant a lot to me and captured my feelings in a way that helped me know myself better' and 'you stole forty hours of my life you fuck'. There are a lot of people who feel like if they read a million words that you wrote, they know you, for better or worse, and especially when the work is on the more personal side, those people will feel that they need to say something directly to you. If you're going to read comments, that's the price of doing business (also the price of reading private messages on your personal reddit account sometimes).

I've spent too much time on this, and it's a conversation that seems like it's been going on for a week anyway, so I'm going to stop here and disable replies from going to my inbox. If you have specific feedback on specific moderator action, use modmail, but nothing I've said here has been said with mod voice, and I haven't done any actual moderation, though I can understand your concerns. I also think at least part of the disagreement, if you can call it that, is whether or to what extent communities with upvote and downvote systems will regulate themselves, which sadly doesn't fit within the margins of this comment.

It is not an "in my opinion" statement or a neutral statement but is, in my opinion, phrased exactly like an asshole said it.

*** A few points:

1. I think the word “unfinished” matters a lot less for webfiction like Worth the Candle or Worm. If you could read five or six finished books in the time it takes to catch up with WtC, you should be allowed to judge the story on the merits of whatever it's done in that word count. WtC has accomplished quite a lot with its words, but it's still a formidable amount of reading if you weren't keeping up from the start, and you try to start now it's rational to compare to works which are in fact finished.

2. Ignoring stupid criticism is a life skill every single human should learn, and it is a thousand times more important for artists of all kinds.

3. Comments critical of anything in WtC are regularly downvoted to oblivion. Downvotes are supposed to protect from spam or trolls, and should not be crude “I disagree” and definitely not “hide the stains from the poor helpless author”. I'm not surprised it suddenly came out all at once.

4. Not all of the “criticisms” are invalid, even if most are kinda dumb. Fans of any fiction often excuse present problems or shortcomings by thinking of future potential, but this does nothing for non-fans or semi-fans. I'm current on WtC, I've stayed for each chapter, but much like HPMOR it's a story punctuated by very high peaks between very, very long plateaus.

5. It's a harem. It's obviously a harem. It is hilariously obviously a harem, and no amount of “deconstructing harems” (which doesn't even start for hundreds of thousands of words) makes it not a harem. All the arguments against it being a harem were just “harems are bad but WtC is good, therefore WtC is not a harem”, which were just creating a new category of harem^{+} which doesn't contain WtC.

I completely agree, but every artist is different and some absolutely cannot ignore even the most stupid criticisms and even worse those criticisms carry vastly more weight with them than praise. This usually does not affect the work, because almost always these criticisms are heard after it's completion, not during it's creation. This is just a rare alignment of the internet and serial fiction, but if da Vinci had heard like a thousand people saying "It's looking great!" when he was mid painting and one person said "Too much brown" then guaranteed when he went to bed that night he would probably be thinking "Am I using too much brown?"

It's a harem, in the sense that it has a character of one gender in a group with other characters of (more or less) the other gender and romance is not non-existent.

It's not a harem, in the sense that the stereotypical scenes and tones that you would expect from a story tagged "harem" are largely absent or turned on their heads.

Toss it in one bin if you care about colour, or the other if you care about vanadium content.

People asking how a work evolves in respect to things they like/dislike on a forum made for this shouldn't get you mad.

It wasn't even a bad review, but a question, and allowing people to only speak when they like something just makes comments/reviews near worthless.

**** Yeah I got you fam. The poster himself defined what he didn't enjoy and ask whether those point get subverted later on. People get mad when other ask for (potentially time saving) tip is silly. No work of fiction is suitable for everyone. Hell, the development of works doesn't always suit the taste of their initial readership.

*** I'm reading the thread and the one thing that confuses me the most is how can someone stick with something they aren't even enjoying. Mind you, I understand that sometimes it takes a while for a work to get going (hence stuff like the 3-episodes rule for anime and series) but reading 70 chapters of something that you aren't enjoying, isn't going in a direction you like, and constantly features literary devices you dislike?

Rather than clumsily attempting to shape an existing work into something that panders to you, wouldn't it be more reasonable to accept it's not for you, drop it, and move on to something more appealing to your preferences or tastes? Or is there something I'm missing here?

I feel like the discussion and criticism in that thread leads nowhere and serves no purpose other than to be inflammatory for the sake of it. And calling out/attacking the author seems imo quite tasteless and not constructive at all.

The deconstructing vs. subverting vs. playing strait genre discussion was interesting to me, and I'd say people made some good points on either side. It's nice to see civil and intelligent disagreements play out well.

I also found the discussion of the character dynamics in the fic interesting. That part of the thread was very helpful to me when determining whether I'd fit into the story's target audience.

**** Resd the top comment on that post where Daystar(? pokemon author) clearly explains how when subverting it can take a long time of just establishing (season or more in tv for one of the examples). So you kind of have to stick with it in some cases for more than 3 chapters even when unsure..

Not to mention that webfiction is notorious for starting of lower quality "until they find their voice".

**** You see this pattern a lot, but, like, super especially on a forum/sub like this where fiction gets few comments/upvotes and meta drama gets 10x engagement.

It goes:

1. Somebody (party A) starts pattern matching everything to nazis
2. Someone else (party B) in a position of authority pulls them up short
3. Party B is accused of somthing (issue C) unconnected to the original dispute, by another party.

In this case Party A was the bot link poster, party B was AW, 'your work is a harem!' is issue C.

Like, you are maybe overcomplicating, when you say it 'leads nowhere and serves no purpose other than to be inflammatory'. The purpose is to be inflammatory. It doesn't need to go anywhere else.

I think its good practice to ignore attacks on authors for a few weeks after they correct someone on culture war stuff. Odds are really good it is just blowback.

*** All matter (including liquid and gas!) is made of "atoms", which are clumps of "protons". Protons are impossible to create or destroy.

The properties of an atom are all derived from its number of protons. A 26-protons clump is Iron. A 29-protons clump is Copper.

That's for pure elements, which are relatively rare. Atoms of different proton count can bind to each other into groups called "molecules" which have their own properties. Water is two 1-proton "Hydrogen" atoms combined with one 8-protons "Oxygen" atom.

Most of the matter in the world is made of (lots and lots of identical) molecules, often combining dozens of atoms. It's relatively easy to get atoms to bind with each other or split up, though only some combinations work. [Here are some low-tech experiments you can do to combine or isolate atoms.]

 

Now, let's talk about gold. Gold is a pure element, a clump of 79 protons. If you've followed me so far, you'll know that this means there are two ways to make gold:

- Take molecules which contain some atoms of gold, and extract those atoms. If you find stone that looks like [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Calaverite-214667.jpg][this]] for example there's a recipe I could teach you that could extract the gold atoms.

- Take an atom of non-gold, and add or remove protons to it until it has exactly 79. Mercury is a pure element made of 80 protons, you'd just have to remove one.

 

Unfortunately, I have bad news for both of these approaches.

- Gold is an element that doesn't bind well with others, so it's very rare for a molecule to contain gold. (That's the same reason gold is so durable! Iron binds with some atoms in the air or water to form molecules of various kinds of /rust/, from which pure iron could be extracted again; but gold does not.) That stone I showed you is even rarer than pure gold, there's none anywhere near your country.

- Adding or removing protons to an atom is /really hard/. You need more heat than a volcano. Even with detailed instructions it will take generations of work before anyone can build a machine that can do it. And that machine will consume so much fuel that it'll cost more to operate than the gold is worth.

 

If you want to get rich with alchemy, pretty much every other metal is easier to extract. Or don't bother with pure elements and just figure out how to make useful molecules or mixtures of molecules; [I'd have to look it up but I'm sure there's lots of low-hanging fruits I could point you towards].

Oh, some of the things I said above are lies, oversimplifications to save space. What can I say, the time machine charges by the letter. Nothing immediately relevant to your question though.

*** Matter is made of particles. Nonperfect collisions degenerate orderly movement of large objects into chaotic movement of the particles (aka heat), but this cannot degenerate further. Some materials such as metals are made of particle clumps held together by forces too strong for chemistry to overcome. Enough heat will overcome any forces keeping matter in its form and allow recombination. Find some way to keep such extreme heat from dispersing to the surroundings and you can control this process.
