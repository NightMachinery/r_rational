Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** So I've been writing a [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/13920/smokeworks][web-serial]] for a short while now, with a pretty low amount of readers (Which is fine, I don't really put it out there), and for the first time yesterday I had someone go through and comment on a decent amount of my chapters.

Some of the comments were honestly, not the nicest. Mostly about how my characters are bland, and how you could kill off the main character, and it wouldn't matter, or how the characters are too sad and too much of "pussies". They were essentially the only comments on my piece, so it felt pretty bad.

I responded back to the latest comment , which said that they were dropping the series, and said I was sorry my story didn't work for them, and that I hoped they found something they liked better. They responded to that with a pretty long response with the reasons why they stopped reading, what they liked, and how they thought that parts of it were being dragged out, which was actually really helpful. Along with that there were numerous comments from them about spelling/grammar mistakes, which I fixed. So the whole process kind of sucked, because it feels bad when you get a negative critique, even when that critique is probably deserved.

*** Some people just react to works in primarily negative ways. I've had people who read through 30+ chapters and left a negative comment on each of them, then dropped the work with a multi-paragraph comment that I didn't really feel like reading. There's probably something to be said for reading every single comment and evaluating them on their merits, but I personally find that really emotionally/creatively draining, especially when there are people whose MO is to be hostile toward the work. If you're able to, ignore those people, though that's a little bit harder if they're one of the only people that you're hearing from.

I think a lot of people are like that in real life too; to them, everything sucks, and most of their time is spent pointing out how everything sucks, usually without any mention of what's good or how things could be better. People get caught up in the feeling of outrage and anger, and then they just run with that because it's self-sustaining, especially if there's an audience/community for it.

Personally at least I find it a lot easier to offer negative feedback than positive feedback. If a story's bad, it's obvious why it's bad: the character's dull, the spelling is bad, it's an unoriginal setting, whatever it's almost always obvious. If a story's good, it's a lot harder to describe why it's good. That doesn't mean in my head I'm spend more time thinking "that's bad" than "that's good" because I prefer my comments to be meaningful, where as in my head I'm fine with just thinking "that's good".

Even this comment is an example of this, I'm giving negative feedback to your statement because it's very easy to verbalize what I disagree with about it. But I don't think I've ever given positive feedback to you when you've commented, even if I do think "alexanderwales has a real insightful comment here", because I don't really have anything positive and meaningful to say.

**** I can imagine how draining it would be to react and read every single negative comment. Especially when a lot of them are just a few words saying that they disliked it, you can't get much feedback from that.

In this case though (perhaps because it was the only response I got) I am pretty happy I engaged. The person responded with a more thorough critique, and PM'd me later to say some encouraging stuff about my work and the execution of it.

I don't know about you personally, but I have a very hard time finding people interested in reading my work or giving me feedback, and that feedback is usually vague responses about why they liked it. While that is nice, and is a little ego boost, it doesn't actually make me better. I know enough about my writing to know there's a lot to work on (which is one of the reasons I love writing).

Having someone, anyone, give feedback, was worth the initial emotional discomfort for me, because I don't have many other opportunities. Feedback is worth a lot more to me right now due to the scarcity, but I imagine with my established authors it's not worth it. Because you are receiving so much of it and because reading so much negative feedback can be harmful and draining, it would probably be a pretty bad idea.

*** It's best when reviewing a work and you know the author will see it to focus on how the work can be improved, rather than just problems. For internet serials, the author generally isn't getting paid, so it just feels really rude to insult the work rather than offer constructive feedback when you didn't even pay for the experience. I know Alexander Wales has talked about this experience in detail, and he described how bad it made him feel when people would offer simplistic, unhelpful feedback on something he spent so much time working on.

I'm of the opinion that people are too critical of others over text, including myself, and it's a trend that should be reversed. Just because you aren't face to face with someone doesn't diminish the impact your words have.

** I was rejected from Harvard Business School without an interview last week. HBS interviews 20% of applicants and admits 10%, and it really sucks to think that I wasn't even in the top 20% of applicants in terms of what HBS wanted.

I solo built a company that now has an 8-figure annual revenue and my GMAT is above the 99.9th percentile. I've spent most of my life operating apart from society's normal support structures and institutions and I had hoped that what I accomplished would speak for itself (with the help of a well crafted application), despite the fact that I'm not an investment banker or MBB consultant. Apparently not.

It doesn't help that my SO is at Harvard Law. I'm surrounded by people that have 'made the cut', and I feel like [[https://img.memecdn.com/stop-i-amp-039-m-one-of-you_o_1298291.jpg][they're no different from me]].

**** Not a dumb question at all. My closest friends [[https://memegenerator.net/img/images/16828244/wipe-tears-with-money.jpg][don't really understand either]]. Which also sucks.

There are two primary reasons.

First, it takes a very uncommon type of individual to be happy living/working completely independently. I'm not a hermit living in the woods, but professionally speaking, I'm not that far off. Turns out I'm not that uncommon, I want to be around other people and I want professional recognition.

Second, I've seen the benefits of belonging to an institution like Harvard thanks to my SO. This is cliched, but it opens so many doors. It's hard to make it when you're a nobody from Bumblefuck, Nowhere. I had multiple bank accounts shut down because the banks thought I was money laundering. They didn't believe someone with no connections could experience business growth of that type, that quickly. If I had Harvard's network back then? Everything could have been solved with a couple phone calls.

tl;dr I want recognition. Also, being a member of HBS and other institutions makes everything easier and I'm tired of playing on Hard mode.

**** I'm going to keep it very general because it's too easy to connect my company with my real identity.

My company heavily utilizes software and web automation (think Selenium and PhanomJS) to perform activities that are traditionally done manually. The core automated task is something so banal that most people's reaction when they find out is, "Seriously?"

Each individual activity only brings in a small amount of money, but the market is huge and scaling is easy when it's fully automated.

Building it out:

1. Identify opportunity and get over the hump of "Seriously?"
2. Lean heavily on automation skills that I learned while botting computer games (thanks, MapleStory/Neopets) as a kid.
3. Rely on third parties to do marketing and advertising for me.
4. Scale up using software instead of people.
5. Eventually hire people.

*** This might be a silly idea since I don't really know how the application process to HBS works, but couldn't you send an email asking why you weren't qualified? Because I don't understand how a school for business could possibly reject someone who has constructed a 10,000,000+ dollar figure company. Asking for their reasons could be illuminating and help with future applications. I've asked some colleges why I wasn't admitted before and they were sometimes perfectly willing to help me by explaining why.

Re: 4-hour Workweek, I assume you're referring to one of these two chapters:

- Mini-Retirements: Embracing the Mobile Lifestyle

- Filling the Void: Adding Life After Subtracting Work

Mini-Retirements - I'm quite well traveled by now, but traveling for the sake of traveling has lost much of its luster. Now I want experiences with the people I care about. Too bad all my friends are climbing the corporate ladder and my SO is a full-time student.

Filling the Void - The void in my life is people/team/collaboration-shaped. I don't think I can fill it by becoming a world class pan flute player or learning Swahili. Business school though? That might fit the ticket. Joining a startup or some kind of maker community might do it too, but that comes with its own host of issues.

Maybe learning swahili isn't worth it roi wise, but I don't think Tim meant for you to take his examples literally. Something competitive like a sport, or martial arts could be a good idea, you'd also make new friends and meet new people. Check out HEMA btw maybe you'll like it..

** Really sad MoL got pushed back a week. I've had three exams in the past 2 days, and have to write a multilevel feedback queue in C by Sunday night. I could use the distraction, one that can't consume too much time even if I procrastinate.

Speaking of distractions, Sudoku is quite a good one. I downloaded an app for it on my phone a few months ago, and it's just a fantastic way to relax and not think about other things. Reading or watching a video doesn't always work because it's pretty easy to zone out of those and focus on other stuff, but Sudoku takes enough attention that it's difficult to zone out of. I've also become pretty good at it without any instruction on how to play at a higher level. My record for the hardest puzzles my app has is 3:45, and for the medium level difficulty that I primarily use as a time waster my top 10 scores are all between 2:00 and 2:40. When I picked up my first Sudoku newspaper puzzle for the first time in forever about 5 months ago, it took me like half an hour to get through a moderately difficult one.

I've also finally moved up to doing bench press reps with 45 plates, which I'm proud of. I don't know my one rep max because I don't have anyone to spot me and that's dangerous, but I finally feel comfortable enough to do sets with 135 pounds of iron. I think this is the first time Ive ever been consistent about going to the gym, and it's nice that it's showing.

I've seen this style of storytelling before, and no thanks.

Also it was starting to look like the story was going to try to tell some intricate multi-layered backstory about how the Titans were created, and secret religious conspiracies among the elites of the show's society, etc, which really isn't for me. Every fantasy and their mother has a multi-layered conspiracy of shadowy cults and evil aristocrats; what I wanted was a simple story about giant invincible zombies and the logistics of fighting them; fighting attrition and maintaining morale despite the fact that even the best Titan killers take casualties in the best of circumstances.

*** I'd say it's one of the best action/suspense/SFF anime out there and perhaps even a must-see.

I am usually pretty blasé with most anime and with battle shounen in particular; the extremely simplistic plots and character archetypes means they lack any depth whatsoever and rational thought goes out the window. When they are good it's usually due to some other aspect (e.g. Angel Beats' soundtrack or Konosuba's comedy).

So I was pleasantly surprised to find that AoT has very little negative qualities of its brethren and seems almost like a spectacle-heavy western show. It features an ensemble cast which is mostly realistic and the writer isn't afraid to kill or depict them suffering. And the protagonist Eren doesn't feel like a self-insert because while hot-headed he is almost always kept in check by the rest. The fights are well thought out (if you excuse how the mobility gear could possibly function) and involve tactics of some kind rather than winning because the plot demands it. And it has more political intrigue as it goes on which I like.

While some of the plot did seem ludicrous, so far I'm quite satisfied with how it's turned out. That said, I've only watched the anime and I did watch it all 47 or so episodes back-to-back. Yeah, there are better stories out there. But if you are looking for SFF and/or action in an audiovisual medium you don't have much choice outside of anime and AoT is one of the best in that regard.

** I recently had the very entertaining experience of reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201644][/Island/]] (by Richard Laymon). It's basically an ecchi manga in text form.

The premise is that a guy goes on a cruise to the Bahamas in his personal yacht, bringing along some close relatives (two male, four female) and the protagonist (the boyfriend of the only female relative who's unmarried---they're both college students). While everyone except the yacht's owner is having a picnic on an isolated island, the yacht explodes, stranding everyone on the island and apparently killing the yacht's owner. However, it very quickly becomes apparent that the yacht's owner intentionally rigged the explosion and is seeking to kill the others, presumably for their money and/or life insurance.

This all sounds quite run-of-the-mill, but the protagonist's narration makes the story much more amusing than it otherwise would be, as the Goodreads reviews like to point out. However---unlike, say, /High School of the Dead/, [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8t2291/d_friday_offtopic_thread/e145ae0/][whose lewdness I've described as "gratuitous"]]---/Island/ does a very good job of avoiding [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mood_Dissonance][Mood Dissonance]], IMO. I rate it four stars.

*** Depends what you mean by "transport". ATMs exist. If your credit union doesn't give you a Visa card or whatever then you just need to get one. Make a temp bank account with a bigger bank or whatever and get your debit card that way.
