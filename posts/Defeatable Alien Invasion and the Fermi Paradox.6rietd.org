A couple of interesting scenario's occurred to me recently.

If a species responds on average slightly more aggressively to the prisoners dilemma, they may not be able to last more than a couple of decades nuclear stand off. But if you have nukes you can also build interstellar ships with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pulse_propulsion][Orion Drive]] so being more cavalier with radiation their space race involved ground launching Orion Drive powered generation ships as insurance before destroying most of their industry in nuclear war. They have enough tools on their generation ships to build habitats and other generation ships from asteroids but their fear of mutually assured destruction lead to rival factions always fleeing or destroying each over. So they they never get the economies of scale required for true microchip fabrication, for them it is forever the 60's. This is an almost plausible way to have the sci-fi trope of a defeatable alien invader if you postulate that modern human civilisation only came out of the Cold War without it going hot was because humans are irrationally and exceptionally optimistic in prisoner's dilemma situations. Maybe even plausibly have some scattered remains of a brief stay in our asteroid belt before rival factions destroyed each other with any survivors fleeing. Remember an Orion drive can always double as a nuclear machine gun.

Another is that if a new understanding of the [[https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-official-nasa-s-peer-reviewed-em-drive-paper-has-finally-been-published]["EM Drive"]] anomaly produced a cheap and easy to manufacture warp drive. Then when everyone's car can fly round the world within an hour, everyone has a delivery vehicle faster and more manueverable than a balistic missile. Borders and border walls become useless, all national governments collapse due to tax evasion by those international commuters. Somali pirates can now raid any suburb on the planet. Billions of poor wannabe pirates can pop out of any sky at any moment and try to capture you for the ransom money or worse. The only way most people have to hide from the pirate plague is to disperse amongst the billions of planets in the galaxy. Any trading post that becomes a known location to too many people is vulnerable to piratical warp ships popping out of the sky at any moment. So we get warp drive but due to lack of economies of scale everything else becomes more primitive. And the population density of the galaxy is kept low by predation from pirates and slavers.﻿


** These are both great set ups for new takes on classic stories. The first one can easily rationalize the standard alien invasion seen in War of the Worlds, Independence Day, and Falling Skies while opening the path for exploration of themes about human society.

The second one sounds like Firefly meets Star Trek with all the pieces necessary for episodic adventures consisting of frontier trading, exploring the unknown, and fighting oppressive governments. Throw in some weird superpowers and you'd have a sci-fi One Piece, which I have no objection to.

** My only thought is that is scenario #2, who makes the warp drives? Would the factories not be just as vulnerable to pirate raids as everyone else? Great ideas though.

** Didn't the EM Drive turn out to not work as they thought it did? And even when it did work, it was only tiny amounts of thrust?

Scenario #2 still works if you replace it with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum][applied phlebotinum]] to taste though.

EDIT: Haven't actually found anything disproving it - I must have misremembered.
