** It's intensely ironic that the last time these two women talked face to face, Cat literally begged her for peace, predicitng the very mess that was subsequently unleashed, only to have every offer spat upon.

Oh, how the tables have turned...

*** That's not /quite/ the last time they talked. It was when Cat gave Cordelia a "friendly" heads up that the Dead King was coming

  “He will devour all of us,” the First Prince said.

   

  “Aye, maybe he will,” the Black Queen said. “So we'll speak again, after your people do some of the bleeding for a change.”

   

  “This will not be forgot,” Cordelia said coldly.

   

  “I would hope not,” Catherine Foundling replied with a hard smile. “A last word of warning, Your Most Serene Highness. If your uncle's army is still digging at the end of the month, there will be consequences. I've yet to run out of lakes to drop.”

** Something I appreciate this, is how Procer is treated like a first-world country.

To them Salians, Villains are just stories, something your nanny tells you as she puts you to bed, or some waylaid disaster to your cousin's neighbour's hometown.\\
But for Callowans, Villains were a part of their lives. Fighting them was something that their country lived for, an implicitly important part of their identity.

I don't think the Accords would really resonate or be understood by anyone in the Highest Assembly apart from Cordelia. They may be facing the Dead King now, but they've never truly suffered for it.
