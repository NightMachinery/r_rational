*tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the biweekly challenge for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/71ke1m/biweekly_challenge_emulated_intelligence/][Emulated Intelligence]], post recommendations, thoughts, ideas, comments, etc. below.*

Emulated intelligence is basically a computer running a model of the brain, rather than a computer running a direct model of a person. The idea is basically that we don't need to necessarily understand how consciousness actually arises, so long as we understand all the basic mechanisms of neurology; if you can accurately scan every neuron, then you just need to put models of those neurons into the computer, connect them up like you saw them connected up in the brain you scanned, and if your model of neuron behavior is accurate, then you should get a thinking brain without having to actually know how the brain works at a high level (and you would then connect the sensory and motor neurons up to whatever you wanted).

See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading][the wiki page]] for more, or if you're interested in works that use the concept, see [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading][the TV Tropes page]], though most of those examples are done poorly, or without regard to the full consequences of the technology.


** If you need some inspiration, the tabletop RPG [[https://robboyle.wordpress.com/eclipse-phase-pdfs/][Eclipse Phase]] is a gold mine for story ideas related to transhumanism. Due to everyone fleeing into space after The Fall as digital minds, the ability to email yourself anywhere in the solar system has led people to congregate in like-minded communities. It is now the norm for people to purchase backup insurance for their mind while copying or altering a person's mind without consent is illegal basically everywhere.

The inner system is controlled by corporations who place criminals and refugees in indentured servitude due to the cost of rebuilding and producing physical bodies. The outer system is filled with every flavor of anarchist and socialist who use social networks to track labor instead of currency. There are "copyrations" made up of hundreds of copies of the same person, "soul traffickers" who sell copies of people on the black market, and whole industries based around creating simulations.

** I would like to enter [[/u/eliezeryudkowsky]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450][/The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover/]] as a somewhat misnamed but excellent short story.

Notably, it has spoiler warnings for /A Fire Upon the Deep/ and /Permutation City/, which would also be fantastic entries.
