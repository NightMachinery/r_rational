Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** One of the players in my group said that she'd like to play in a campaign set in a fantasy version of the city that we live in, and I'm somewhat taken with the idea, partially because the city that I'm in has a lot of stuff to translate to a fantasy world (there's literally a giant stone tower that sits up on the hill looking out on the city, and we're on the shores of a lake so cold it keeps its dead).

The problem is in striking the right tone in bringing the fantasy elements into the modern world. I know I /don't/ want something like Shadowrun; I think I want a kind of Miyazaki feel to the game, where most things are bright and optimistic, with only the occasional spots of (easily identifiable) darkness. The question is how to approach that from a worldbuilding perspective.

I think my starting place is probably the removal of globalization. There's no McDonald's or Starbucks, there are only small, local shops run by local people, who get their products/ingredients from /other/ small local establishments, and if they /don't/ then it's kind of a big deal, like you order something from a far-off city and it's this long, arduous journey of your package to get to you - an event you look forward to, rather than the machinations of Amazon.

In terms of tech level, I think I'll probably take out guns entirely, both because most tabletop rulesets I'm interested in don't support them, and because you get more of the classic fantasy feel if the police are walking around with swords and breastplates. Cars are in, because a modern city doesn't make sense without them, but probably given a fantasy flair like an engine the runs off a small, captured fire elemental, and there are trolleys to navigate the hills in order to give it the more local feel.

I'm still sort of mulling over the core aesthetic /before/ getting started on taking a map of our city and marking it up, but would maybe like a little bit of input on what constitutes that provincial, PG-rated world design that I'm going for.

*** My gut response was to suggest the city building system from The Dresden Files RPG since it's useful for converting parts of your hometown into occult symbolism, but I don't think that's what you're going for. Instead, I'm going to recommend [[https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/16/16250.phtml][Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine]] as the only game I've ever seen where the mechanics encourage creating the atmosphere of a Studio Ghibli film.

One idea I have for this style of worldbuilding is focusing on the interplay between the mundane world and fantastic world. Magic is usually something that intrudes upon the characters lives that they don't understand very well, but isn't usually a significant threat to anyone. The villains are often human and most of the danger people get into is all too real. Even the climax of Totoro was about a looking for a missing child.

The key to this is to figure out where to draw the boundary between the mundane and fantastic parts of the world, and how they interact with each other. It can be a wall around the city to keep monsters out, friendly spirits only children can see, aristocrats with magical knowledge, etc. I think an important rule of thumb is that the story is about a mundane conflict that the fantasy exists to enable.

And crossbows. Law enforcement is going to have ranged weapons.

** Is there any reason that I'm overlooking why building a city in magically floating terrain at between 3 and 6 km of height would be completely impractical and wouldn't happen even if there was valuable resources there and it was a convenient place to live because other reasons?.What engineering problems would have to be solved ? , any other cosequence of living in group of floating islands that would impact how the inhabitants live their daily lives ?

Details:

-The inhabitants are mostly flying Pokemon , they can fly and survive the lower pressures and oxygen concentrations during ,and at lest some of them can carry multiple times their weight , and low mass high value things can be teleported.

-The city would be floating over the ocean , near the continent and other cities in the coast, so I guess transporting food could be a problem , but there are solutions to this , and the city would have an abnormal number of people working on transporting things by air anyway .

*** Shipping takes a lot of energy. Lifting takes more.

One of our most energy-efficient ways of shipping is container ships. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_M%C3%A6rsk][Emma_Maersk]] is a big one, carrying 55k tons of cargo, with a 47 km/h top speed, and an 81 MW engine. Working all that out, it has an efficiency of 8.86 kg * m / J. That is to say, given one joule of energy, it can move 8.86 kilograms of material (including +both cargo and itself+ /only the cargo, and not itself/) a distance of one meter.

If you use gross weight instead of net (and count it as moving the ship too), the efficiency rises to 27.4 kg * m / J. For comparison, a person walking (with no cargo) has an efficiency of 0.3 kg * m / J, or 100x the energy burned to move the same load the same distance.

--------------

All of the above is pure inefficiency, as no thermodynamic work is being done at all. Lifting against the force of gravity, on the other hand, requires work.

I'll assume that your planet has 2% stronger gravity than Earth (because 10.0 m/s^{2} is nicer than 9.81 m/s^{2}). That would work out to 0.1 kg * m(up) / J. 3x as hard as walking, or 88-274x as hard as shipping. *That 3 km of lifting uses /at minimum/ (assuming perfectly efficient mechanisms) as much energy as 9 km of walking or 264-882 km of shipping.*

Flying is almost certainly less efficient than walking, so you need to add energy requirements for that too, and remember that the walking and half of the shipping calculations are based off of the mass /including/ the transporter, not purely the cargo.

**** I guess that would be a big problem , teleporting things so high would also be dificult so the city would have either be almost autosuficient( that would need plants capable of surviving at that heigh) or have a lot of transports . Some people would have access to magical bags of holding that would allow them to transport more things , those actually spend energy to let you lift things ignoring their weight and would have to be charged often , but there is a source of the magical energy required in the city(that's one of the reasons people would want to live there) so that would help.Also there are multiple ways of teleporting things, althogh all of them have problems whith teleporting things to high places.

The problem is that even then I'm not sure if that is enough to make the city viable, I guess could put really strong air currents towards the floating islands , which help getting things there , and makes sense by the way the floating islands work, and it also makes sense that flying moves would work easily near the floating islands , so the pokemon get extra energy for free for the wind manipulation shenanigans that help then to fly.

Things will probably still be expensive there, but not so prohibitively expensive that the city won't be able to exist.

** I recently have an idea on a kind of thinking and technological axis.

Esoteric-Exoteric and Magic-Technology

Magic is the power to disregard the laws of nature to get what you want. Technology is learning and using the laws of nature to get what you want.

Esoteric is the idea that only the mind/soul exist and reality is just a dream/illusion, that power comes from within. Mysticism basically. While Exoteric is the idea that the world around us is real, and not some dream, that power comes from without. Science basically.

When combined, it gives off interesting basis on things. Esoteric-Magic and Exoteric-Technology are the usual Mystic Magic and Hard Sci-Fi Tech. Esoteric-Technology would be divine revelation, the spark of mad genius, the leaps in advancement. While Exoteric-Magic would be the more rational magic systems.

** I have been thinking about a civilization that is so advanced that they keep bodies like meat suits. These people keep their brains in "jars" and they then plug those brains into different meat suits.

This society would be so advanced that they would have AIs inside of the jar with the brain. The Jars themsleves would not need the meat suits to move around or anything, to me I always imagined them as more spherical ghosts from destiny. Maybe something like this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/55tmmf/bungie_please_have_festival_of_the_lost_ghost/]] .

I kinda want to see one of these brain jars in a DnD setting where they hijack bodies to use their abilities but I dont know if they would be to OP or what. Maybe with the AI enhanced brain he could memorize ALL spells and he wouldn't necessarily take the powers of his victims.

IDK

You could be in a funny situation where you hijack a goblin's body and using their vocal cords you speak in the traditional scraggly voice, but you use very eloquent terminology.

*** If you just want an RPG setting where mind uploading is the norm, you should definitely check out the transhumanist sci-fi game Eclipse Phase. The core PDF is free.
