** I don't know about best anime ever, but I /heavily/ enjoyed this one when it was coming out, from the beginning to the end. Highly recommended.

*** Agreed. The second half of the show was a little slower-paced and not quite as awesome as the first half in my opinion but it was still one of my favorite shows overall. The midshow climax was the best I've seen in anime.

** *This show resolves the conflict of the first season BY SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTATION with the fate of humanity at stake.*

I imagine at least a few people here dropped whatever they were doing and began watching just off of that sentence alone. If you need me to continue to describe why this is the best anime ever, I shall oblige.

Humanity has been sandwiched between two reality-manipulating-ancient-eldritch-tree-gods called The Tree of Genesis and the Tree of Exodus, respectively. The show starts when a few members of the Kurasibe clan (secret mages who serve the Tree of Genesis) switch sides, strand their princess on a desert island, and try to destroy the world by awakening the Tree of Exodus.

Except, that's not what's actually happening. According to the rebels, the Tree of Genesis controls everything, making free will an illusion. The Tree of Exodus is the only power that can match it, albeit at significant risk to basically the entire planet. The show constantly asks the question of /how much of this was predestined?/ and still manages a compelling story.

*You're still here? What's wrong with you?*

The show is very, very tight. There's like ten recurring characters in the whole thing, and never a wasted moment. The two main characters, Mahiro and Yoshino, really do behave like what two smart young adults would, given their situation. They're the most Genre Savvy pair I've seen, and play off each other's strengths and weaknesses like the lifelong friends they are. The begin in episode 1 mature and responsible, with a large portion of the story told as flashbacks (in fact, one of the most important characters died long before the story started, but still has enormous presence).

It also contains a huge amount of Shakespeare. /Huge/, and it's actually some of the most effective use of literary allusion in anything. Seriously, this anime made me dig out my old copies of /Hamlet/ and /The Tempest/ with more excitement than any english class.

*I'm trying to say that this show is practically prefect in every way while spoiling as little of it as possible.*

*If you have any doubt at all, just watch episode one. This anime also has the best first episode of anything.*

I know that content on this sub can suffer from overhyping, but this show really is up there with /Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood/; it's just as good and much shorter.

I can't recommend it enough. I can't.

*** I liked it as well, not "this show is practically prefect in every way " kind of liked, but defenitely something i recommend to other people..

there are a few points about the story that i remember not being as sure i liked, but to be honest i no longer remember if the story resolved them in the end properly or not.

But in any case, don't you think your post is fairly spoilerish and takes a lot of the mystery out of the story?

**** No, I don't think so too much. Everything I mentioned was apparent to me in the first three episodes or so, and you have to spoil a little bit for someone else to make a judgement on anything.

***** well, first three episodes is not that little. sure plenty of reviewers go with the "let's just summarize episode 1" as their approach to making a synopsis, but even then its just 1 episode. And actually the really good descriptions usually don't do even that..

*** Just finished the third episode and I haven't seen either of them do anything smart yet. Mahiro in particular is an idiot. He knows that the talismans have limited uses and he keeps spending them recklessly. He fights that spear guy despite the princess telling him to run and doesn't even ask her for advice. I would have thought that the princess, in the interest of keeping her only link to the outside world alive, at least give Mahiro some tips since he was so dead set on fighting.

Yoshino ins't that much better. Points for asking if he could resurrect the dead when it didn't even occur to Mahiro but I can't believe he just dismissed the idea completely. I understand that the 'most powerful mage' in the world told him it wasn't possible but Yoshino doesn't *know* that it's impossible. Just a few hours ago he discovers that magic exists that follow these vague rules and yet he swallows that healing magic can guide you to people but it can't ressurect the dead?

I'm probably being harsh on Yoshino since he just had his world turned upside down so I'll keep watching to see how he makes sense of this. Mahiro seems like a lost cause though.

Good show by the way, I just wouldn't call the characters smart from what I've seen so far. Average probably.

**** I don't think pointing out Mahiro's irrationality is a valid criticism; I think the whole point is that Yoshino is the one with a good head on his shoulders.

Speaking of which, you're not giving Yoshino enough credit for the tracking thing; he only saw it once and then made some radically lateral thinking under duress later. Conversely, predicting the helicopters (which you didn't even mention) was /too/ good to be believable: even if he had the exact timings of all the other strikes (which I think it's safe to assume he didn't), the margin of error in extrapolating to the last one would be way bigger than the ~3-second window (generously) that was his target.

You're absolutely right about the resurrecting thing, though. First, if that doesn't qualify as healing, then I don't know what does. Second, dismissing things for being "against the world's logic" is so obviously invalid that I almost literally facepalmed when I heard Hakaze say it. A few hours earlier, Yoshino would've said that /magic/ was irrational by definition, and he wouldn't have drawn the (actually nonexistent) distinction between "magic" and "miracles." And if he was scientifically literate, he would've said that "the world's logic" was the second law of thermodynamics, meaning that healing magic would be the kind that was the /most/ "against" it.

***** Facepalmed on the next episode. Where he tried to save those people and he did the incredibly stupid thing instead of using magic. I don't know what to mention since it could be a spoiler but god damn was Yoshino an idiot in that scene.

Edit: The helicopter thing was pure luck. It didn't matter that Yoshino could predict where the helicopters would be since he couldn't control when spear guy would be there. He had absolutely no idea that Mahiro was in the tunnel or would have led him there. He couldn't control when the helicopters would get there, being either too late and spear guy following after them or too early and blowing up the tunnel before they reached it. Yoshino had incredibly little control over that event.

Yeah, but that's nothing compared to leaving the umbrella and water bottle behind, or being reluctant to use a house. Hey guys, they're /dead/, and you're working off of limited supplies.

I swear, when one of the most substantively interesting things about a show is that the theme music is in 6/4...

******* That wasn't stupid. He might have just felt guilty about not saving them and tried to give them a burial of sorts by protecting their bodies from the rain. No clue what the water is supposed to mean.
