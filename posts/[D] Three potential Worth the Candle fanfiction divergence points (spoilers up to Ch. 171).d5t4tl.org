I saw some discussion about Worth the Candle recently that was about how hard it would be to write fanfic for it, considering how connected the world and meta-narrative and even magic systems are to June's past and creations, the full extent of which we have yet to see. This will probably get easier once the story is complete, but I've already thought of a few points that would make for some interesting and workable new takes on the plot, and was wondering if others have thought of more.

*1) June focuses on SOC*

How much different would the story be if SOC wasn't treated like a dump stat early on? By the time Juniper realizes how important it is to resolving conflicts among his companions and helping with their character development (which also makes them stronger) he has already arguably lost a lot of value.

A June that focused on SOC rather than PHY (or maybe rather than MEN, if he needs PHY to survive the early game) may have been able to negotiate with Aumann, subvert the Falathur betrayal, avoid the Masters debacle, maybe even convince the Uther Watch crew not to try and kill him. Also he'd probably gain a lot more loyalty among his companions a lot quicker, which would unlock benefits for them sooner... In general, he would be a lot less individually powerful in combat, but also probably end up in combat a lot less often, with more, stronger allies when he does. Hell he might even end up in the Lost King's Court earlier, and the story becomes one largely focused on political intrigue.

*2) June goes back "home" as soon as he can*

This is a pretty obvious one; June's "mother" burned all his Aerb equivalent's homemade game books, with the full details of the game system in it, by the time he meets her in the recent chapters. If he had the courage to go sooner, he would have likely gotten his hands on a completed version, and not only dealt with a lot of the personal drama earlier (maybe badly) but been able to min-max his build more competently, and much more munchkinry would ensue.

This comes with some risks, of course, like exclusion zones and ramped up villains. It also makes it so that the order of events in the story is very unlikely to be similar afterward, so it might be interesting to see how the later companions are met (if they still are, and not just replaced with new ones) and so on. This fanfic also becomes a lot more feasible to write if [[/u/alexanderwales]] ever plans to release a full version of the "player handbook," so there's a way to tell what obscure skill perks and synergies are available.

*3) June is aware of deal with DM*

This is may change virtually nothing, or it may change everything. We still don't know the full details of the pre-insertion agreement, but just knowing where he's going and why would definitely cut out a lot of the early story confusion and drift, and allow him to focus on his goals (short and long term) that much more efficiently.

This may in fact lead to him going home sooner for his notes, but even that would be a very different circumstance in this version. My one main prediction is it would lead to him getting into a romance with Mary earlier (perhaps before he's really "ready" for it?): he would be a lot more confident and knowledgeable early on, and I see that making him attractive much more quickly to her. How that would affect his relationship with Fenn, or the group dynamics, is just one open question among many.

So yeah, those are the three that have come to mind to me while reading. Curious to know what others have thought up.


** On the subject of "Juniper goes SOC", here's a post Alexander Wales did on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9shzxl/worth_the_candle_what_would_a_soc_based_juniper/e8pirx8/][just that thing]] and also another one on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/aczz31/its_2019_ask_me_anything/edg76k1/][Juniper going LUK.]]

*** Neat, I totally missed those. I assumed the early-game would all go mostly the same because Juniper would need PHY to survive and wouldn't cotton onto SOC value until the debacle with the mercenary group, but that start is interesting too.

Also considered a LUK beginning, but had the same issue he cites: I don't think Luck is a particularly compelling trait in a main protagonist. Not for our genre at least.

**** I actually think that it might be possible to make it at least somewhat compelling to run on LUC. Rather than what Wales suggests in the post of randomly walking around, I would make a list of quests and/or locations and roll a random die or something to see where to go next. You could then plan extrapolate from location and quests why you might be lucky to go there and make plans in case of the various situations.

It would depend a lot on the mechanics of LUC, i.e. does luck take you roads that the gamemaster thinks is good for you or does it prioritize your wishes and priorities? If it's the latter it could potentially be very powerfully combined with soul magic and spirit possibly prompting Juniper to be forced to compromise with his ethics regarding self-manipulation. It seems at least plausible that this approach would have taken Juniper 'home' before the game rules were burned.

***** Luck is precognition, effectively, but it's fairly weak the farther in the future you go, and Wales has said that it's worse at predicting people than more ordinary things. I don't think this is a viable plan, at least for quests that would last longer than a few days.

*** One other point is that with SOC, Jun would be a nicer character to read, and may also accelerate progress in the therapy storyline. He may get error messages from raising SOC, instead of the ones he got for MEN. If the DM is making the therapy progression a key plot driver then this may accelerate the overall plot.

** So, like, the fanfic that interests me, the one that I would write, is "Juniper doesn't go Full Disclosure". Like, he just doesn't tell anyone that there is a dungeon master or he has a character sheet, etc. He just does the Uther deal.

​

So no one is aware of narrative stuff at all, no one understands the loyalty thing, Juniper's power ups are inexplicable to them, they don't know he has Quests, etc. He is much more alone in his team, he has to sort of manipulate/fiat people into doing the stuff the DM is making him do, can't appeal to the sheet in his mind.

*** Oh, I like that one. All the others seem more like "fix-fic" kinds of hooks where June just does something better, or takes decisions that are better on the long term, but this hook actually has the potential to increase conflict by a huge amount.

On the other hand, I dunno. Joon told Mary /everything/, like, as soon as she got a little bit suspicious, same thing for most companions. To hide something so huge to every one of his friends, he'd basically have to be a completely different person.

**** Not necessarily. All it'd take is for the DM to add a term to Joon's isekai adventure that if he tells anyone about his true origins, then he instantly loses. Not that he'd know that immediately after being mindwiped, but a little notification window telling him he'll die if he reveals he's from earth would do the trick.

Of course, that would likely end with Joon's quick death since he can't lie worth a damn to start with and wouldn't gain Amaryllis's trust without further tweaking, but it's more workable.

** I think there's a lot of crossover potential that's going untapped.

- Protagonist of a different story shows up on Aerb instead of June, either randomly or at a common jumping-off point from their own franchise. This has a nice self- balancing aspect, as most protagonists are more competent but lack June's knowledge. May or may not include an AU version of the Can't Go Home Again village, meeting with a DM who's a fan of the canon DM, etc.

- AU where June read [story] and ran a game based on it so it's included in Aerb. Harry Potter wizards are a known race/magic with their own aethenum, Parahumans are around as "trauma mages", there's a city/ country based on Marvel with a powerful Avengers Guild (Quicksilver the Velocity Mage, Iron Man the Rune/Gem Mage, Bruce Banner the Passion Mage etc.)

- June finally investigates Star Magic and finds a plane based on [story], either as a thing that's always been part of Aerb offscreen or as a result of him levelling Star Magic to superhuman levels.

- Characters from a big, flexible universe meet the DM and enter/are trapped in the simulation. Neo discovers an experimental test Matrix, the Enterprise crew finds an abducted 21st-century human, the X-men find a powerful telepath/reality warper tormenting some highschooler, etc.

** For shorter fics, there's also the plot hooks and quests that have been dropped along the way that could be elaborated on further.

It's unlikely, after all, that we'll ever find out what the deal was with the Risen Bile in Barren Jewel, beyond the small amount that intersected with the storyline. Fenn's companion quest and backstory is closed for the foreseeable future. We're not going to see Joon visit most of the exclusion zones (and, heck, there's one that comes with a built-in Mother of Learning crossover opportunity).

*** I wouldn't be surprised if Joon actually went to the time loop exclusion in the story. The author at one point talked about how the story was kind of designed to contain every trope that he personally loved, and said that he would have even included a time loop if he could. It's possible the mention of the time loop exclusion was his attempt to make that possible.

** This seems (to me) to run into the problem that the world isn't all that developed outside of what Juniper's interacting with, from the perspective of the reader. The author has put a great deal of thought into the setting, and it shows, but the lack of familiarity with the setting and limited viewpoint is a key part of the story.

Where something like Naruto isn't all that well-written, it has an expansive setting the audience is passingly familiar with, somewhat cares about, and understands. There is an established sandbox to play in.

In Worth The Candle, fanfic authors have two options: to follow the path set by Juniper and only work within those bounds, which would feel forced (see "stations of canon"), or follow the inevitable course of different starting conditions/circumstances and move into areas the story hasn't covered and reader isn't familiar with - at which point, the whole thing starts feeling a great deal more like an AU/Original fiction, and the author and readers don't have the same built-in attachment that other series have.

It's probably not an /insurmountable/ problem, but it's a pretty big one, and I don't think it's likely we'll see much fanfiction at all.

** I think you're misunderstanding the reasons why people think fanfiction for WtC is hard to create. It's not that the story is lacking for interesting divergence points or alternate universe setups, it's that Aerb is a huge setting that has a very narrow path cut down it called canon. It is such that any significant change to the story would entail writing almost entirely new settings, plots, and characters from whole cloth, which is a helluva lot more work than most fanfiction entails.

Take Harry Potter: you can mess around with its plot on a micro scale a lot and not have to worry about the overall structure changing, because Voldemort drives much of that conflict, and he'll do his thing independently of any schoolyard shenanigans. It is exactly the kind of narrative crutch that makes writing fic appealing to authors: someone has already done a lot of the hard work in figuring out what's going to happen.

In comparison, fanfiction for WtC would be like the Alexandra Quick series for HP; it is set in the same world, but functionally is an original story. And fics like AQ are few and far between, for the simple reason that an author comfortable with taking on that much of the burden for story creation is more likely to just make an their own story altogether.

*** Sure, I think I said a similar thing to a lesser degree at the start of my post. In any case, that's why I picked 3 divergence points that mostly allow the story to maintain the same plot and momentum. A /really/ divergent WtC fanfic wouldn't have June as the MC at all, or have him swap places with Arthur as the original dreamskewer, or have him explore a world other than Aerb.

That said, I think you may be overestimating how much rational-fanfic authors differ in this regard than others. I think just about all of the major ones that I've read substantially change enough of canon, or explore substantially new directions/characters, that I could see why someone might think they might as well just make their own story, and yet we choose to write fanfic instead because it's the world itself, for the most part, that we want to play with.

** Hm ... I think if I was to create a point of divergence it would be that the rest of the old crew showed up on Aerb. I really, really thought I was going to get my wish when Reimer appeared. Have Reimer, Tiff, and Craig show up at the same time or alternatively: Joon dies with the helldiver setting on, DM decides to give him and Aerb one more chance, Reimer, Tiff, Tom, and Craig all dream-skewered and have to figure things out from there. I think if I were to write it I'd give them loyalty scores relative to each other and say 30 skills (simplifies things on my end and increases their interdependence) each rather than 40 like Joon but otherwise leave thing the same. They have to figure out what's up with Aerb, find and save Joon from the Hells, find the lost king, etc.

Whichever.

** Consider an other grand tradition: swapping. Imagine an Arthur entering a world full of things June created, and legends of a hero that turns out to have been him. Did Juniper create a world with such suffering just to have fun in it? Did his DM obsession crush his ethics when he got some mysterious power to create world? Or was he but a victim, like Arthur? These questions would trouble Arthur through the story.

And how are the legends of the Grand King Juniferious Smythe different from the legends of King Uther? Maybe he revealed the full truth to his companions, some of whom are still alive. I think there is plenty of juice here.

He starts with no clue and no power. Once he finds his old friend with new clothes, he would have to munchkin everything just from his knowledge of the game. Perhaps the first step is trading his knowledge for Entad's instead of gold. Maybe he should become a companion? Or just hide in the time chamber and take up woodworking.
