** Paragon just refuses to take Maxine Clive and Commonplace seriously as more than a front for a Shenti-led genocide and they keep getting outmaneuvered as a result.

Clive and Tunnel Vision are idealists. They wouldn't burn down their own country's food supply, and any hints that they would has to be considered as part of a larger maneuver.

But because it's convenient for the Guardian to imagine their enemies as bloodthirsty monsters, they immediately assume the worst and get themselves baited again.

*** Yeah, they even stopped nudging Humdrums into performing terrorist attacks because they decided it did more harm than good, so it was /very/ clear that they wouldn't starve out the country. Granted, Paragon didn't have the benefit of a Tunnel Vision interlude to see the reasoning behind why they stopped with the nudged terrorist attacks, but it still should have been clear that this is something that goes entirely against the ideology of Commonplace. Especially since, as they make clear in this chapter, that's a tactic that disproportionately harms the poor.

Also, if they think Maxine Clive is just a puppet, why the hell do they think mindreading her is going to yield reliable intel? They've been outplayed before because their "reliable intel" turned out to be a trap, and with a projector of Grace's caliber it's child's play to seed a Humdrum's mind with false plans and misinformation. They really should have realized that the "plan" they pulled from Maxine's mind makes no sense given what they know of Commonplace and is more likely to be yet another instance of misinformation, given that they've already proven to be so very fond of that tactic.

Honestly, Paragon deserves to lose here. They've bought into their own propaganda and can no longer tell it apart from reality.

  “The winds will be high,” said my mother. “Firefighters and planes with retardant can be taken out. With well-placed firebombs and palefire, Commonplace and the Shenti can create a firestorm. I made many such attacks during the Shenti War.”

  Jun got a heavy look in his eyes when she mentioned that. They're using our tricks against us. The enemy had a cruel sense of irony.

  [...]

  “Then, Commonplace gets their revolution. Or the Shenti finish us off. Without food, the Principality will die. The manner of death is just a formality. Maybe Tunnel Vision doesn't even care about the details, past that point.”

  “I don't think so,” said Ana. “Maxine Clive has a plan.”

  “Fool,” my mother said. “You think that Humdrum puppet has made a single decision for that group? This is the plot of The Pyre Witch. A Praxis specialist.”
#+end_quote

They've fallen into Grace's trap so easily because they're projecting themselves onto her. Because if they were in her place, that's what they'd do. If they were part of Commonplace, there's no way they'd take orders from a Humdrum, so she must not either.

Deep down, even if Grace is their enemy, at the end of the day she's a projector like them, and in Paragon projectors don't care about the people under them.

  I stitched that General Benthey person while we were talking strategy. Remember Helmfirth? That city that got blown by the Voidsteel missiles?” He gritted his teeth. “Turns out, they have more of those. And they might fire them at the Agricultural Islands if they think they're losing the battle. Wipe out the enemy without starting any fires. With some collateral damage here and there.”
#+end_quote

So, confirmation that the attack on Helmfirth was carried out by Paragon. Someone really needs to take a peak into that book and see what's really going on.

  As it turned out, mass arrests of Green Hands didn't pacify the public, but the exact opposite. The riots had exploded across Elmidde with new ferocity, and law enforcement had responded by flooding the streets with cops.

  According to the radio news, someone had tried to assassinate a pro-Paragon member of Parliament, too. Enoch Trembath, some old ex-Guardian with a bushy mustache. His son had sat next to me in Physics 110, and had helped explain some of the more thorny concepts when I zoned out.

  A sweet boy. He didn't deserve this.

  Loyalists on the street had replied with fervor, and in the ensuing chaos, Parliament had been taken to Paragon for security. A few hours later, someone set fire to the House of Ministers. The blaze had been extinguished, but it had confirmed everyone's fears.

  /Was this part of Commonplace's plan?/ Had this all been some elaborate ruse to escalate the conflict? I couldn't keep track of this cat and mouse nonsense anymore.

  But one way or another, chaos ruled the streets.

Well, I saw this one coming from a mile away. Paragon was already losing the public opinion battle, and then they decided to go for a wave of police brutality. Worse, they were baited into an even more severe and brutal crackdown thanks to false intel Commonplace fed them. So yeah, Wes, this is part of Commonplace's plan.

Right now, it's looking like their plan is to whip up public support and plunge the country into chaos while luring Paragon away, thus denying them the opportunity to reassert control. I'm guessing the next step is for Commonplace to swoop in and take control of the Principality basically unopposed and riding a wave of populist support while also sabotaging those Paragon forces that were lured away. Maybe there's a trap at the agricultural islands, maybe the Shenti fleet is real even if the plan to burn things down isn't, something along those lines. Regardless, I'm guessing they seize the country now, with further plans to defend against Paragon's inevitable attempt to reconquer it once they realize they've been had. The revolution appears to be entering its final stages.

Going to burn down, I assume.
