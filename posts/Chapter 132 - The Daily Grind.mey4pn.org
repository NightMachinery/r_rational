** Tangentially related to this chapter; dang, you'd think the people who enjoy a moderately rational work like this wouldn't be so on board the whole “solve problems with violence” train. Like, hoo boy! Some people really want the protagonist to just execute anyone who's a problem! That's awkward!

*** Yep, definitely. Setting aside the moral/ethical problems with just killing/beating someone into submission, most of the time, there are consequences further than the one committing the violence are even aware of. Inevitable backlash that makes violence at best a band-aid on an ongoing issue.

**** I'm not sure I buy the 'violence doesn't work and just makes more problems' argument. I think it might be something we wish was true because we dislike violence and don't want to live in a world where it is a viable solution to problems, but that we do unfortunately live in a world where violence can be a viable solution.

For example, plenty of actual rulers have stayed in power for a long time by straight up murdering (or visiting unspeakable tortures and then death upon) anyone who opposed them. They are proof that violence can work if you're willing to be an utterly ruthless monster about it. People fear death and will do whatever the maniac wants if that's what it takes to survive. This is basically monarchy and dictatorship 101.

There were points in time where people even killed whole families, including children, to ensure that there would be no rival claimants to rally future rebellions around. They may have even been right to do so, at least from a purely utilitarian perspective, if their actions prevented all the deaths that would occur in future wars. Which is weird, since, you know, child murder.

***** Thing is, "we don't like it" /is a problem/.

Emotions aren't something that exist separate from the human world. Our entire lives are nothing but emotional reactions to the stuff that we do, see, and experience. Yes, people stayed in power by killing everyone who opposed them, but it's not like that created no problems. It just didn't create problems /for them/. And even then, half those rulers die to assassination from some pissed off revolutionary anyway.

Sure, sometimes violence, especially as self-defense, is a cruel calculus of what will cause the least suffering. But even that assumes that you've done the math, and decided that your self is worth protecting. Any violence done hurts more people than just the target. Fuck, there's a thread on AskReddit right now about the psychological damage that killing in combat deals to the survivors.

So yeah, I'm okay with people saying that violence can accomplish their goals. But I question whether those goals are rational, and I absolutely think they're shitty people.

****** How can a goal be irrational?

I think the rational/irrational analysis is more something to be applied to the means used to accomplish goals, while goals themselves are more like value judgments that are outside the framework.

** I really appreciate that they don't just try to... slot a new person in to their lives and hearts and organization. Too often in fiction people are just replaceable skill-havers; but in TDG, there was only one Virgil, there's only one Alanna.

*** It's also, with a resource as widely applicable and varied as magic is, everyone's going to have a different idea of how it should best be used. Their own projects that they get invested in and that disappear when they're gone because everyone else is busy working on their own stuff.

*** I think I subconsciously stole that vibe from Worth The Candle. The feeling that a character leaves behind a hole from their absence is both a little too real for me, but also important to making a story where there's narrative weight to anything at all.
