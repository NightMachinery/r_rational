I don't really think of myself as a rationalist. I read a lot of LessWrong and I'm an avid follower of HPMOR, but I haven't expanded my horizons much beyond that, and any true rationalist wouldn't procrastinate a two-month long homework up until the last week. This is just a disclaimer before I start posting some random fic ideas I've had that, upon reflection, would (I think) be very interesting stories if written by an actual rationalist. Apologies if this is out of place, which I'm very afraid it is.

The first one is one I've had for a long time; I've been reading many stories about groundhog day loops - Infinite loops, Hard Reset, Mother of Learning - and have often wondered what would happen if the entire world looped physically at the end of the week. Think, one week from now at precisely midnight (or when you die, whichever comes first), your mind will be transferred to the you of today - and this happens to literally human being (animals too, maybe?) on the planet.

My first attempt at writing this (disregarding a one-shot where I had an old man at his deathbed wondering why his family was abandoning him in his final hours, which coincided with the beginning of the loops) was a romance story because I realized I wasn't smart enough to emulate the politics of such a world that I could write from the perspective of someone in power, and I couldn't think of any other potential conflict that would both be interesting and directly relevant to the looping - so I decided to make it unrelated so that I could just showcase the new world in the background, kinda.

This, I realized, was stupid. So, I'm offering the idea to someone who's smart enough to consider the implications of such a world - what would the law be like, if there was any? Would there be any economy, considering that money and the like are now worthless since they can't be transferred for more than a week? Etc. etc. - and knows what sort of plot would best befit such a background.

My second idea is based on pretty much any universe where anything magical is forgotten by normals. Imagine if somebody posted a video on the internet. He requests, on a forum, that people comment prior to watching the video - a few comply. Ten minutes later, they realize that they posted a message, but didn't write it - or perhaps they don't remember it. Nine hours later, it's widespread knowledge on the internet that anybody who watches the video will forget all interactions they had pertaining to the video (did they comment about it? Talk about it with their friends?) and the video itself.

Everybody is freaking out.

The protagonist, in my head, is a magical enforcer - someone who generally keeps people from learning about the masquerade (whatever this masquerade might be), and now has to deal with the fact that the internet knows about this video and its effects - and he knows that the internet is /very/ smart.

Either that, or he's the pro-humanity person that posted the video in the first place.

I gave up on this when I realized I had no idea where I wanted to go with this.

...That's it. If anyone wants to take these ideas for rationalfics, or takes inspiration from them at least, thank you for working on something which would otherwise be trash hidden in my mind.


** "Money" as we know it would probably be largely replaced by status and favors. Property would still exist, but you could only own things nearby. You might do a huge favor for your neighbor, in exchange for trading houses.

Most jobs would become unnecessary. This means most of the population would probably be rendered unemployed, and most of the downsides of this would be avoided.

I could imagine jobs like manning power plants which would normally require far too much paperwork to pay for conventionally could involve some weird kind of taxation. If the power man asks for something, you give it to him. If someone doesn't, they're shunned. If they aren't shunned, the entire block loses power for a week. Then again, maybe these jobs would be rare enough for volunteer work on its own. And maybe volunteer work is nothing but this, done on such an instinctual level that we don't even notice it.

Murder would obviously be much less important. Bureaucracy would have to be massively reduced. Much of crime would probably be punished by shunning, but in cases where it's necessary it would be entirely possible to just lock someone up again each week. You know where they are after all. Or you could repeatedly kill them for a while.

Pregnancy and STDs would no longer be an issue. The consequences of that are obvious.

What exactly are you doing for people who die during the week? Based on the first story you mentioned, they lose all memories?

Right. And there wouldn't be any practical way of tracking this at scale, so house swaps would largely be on the honor system.

*** I was thinking that they loop back to the anchor point along with everyone else who either died or made it to the end of the week. The story I mentioned was an old man wondering why his family has abandoned him, when only days ago they were crying at his side and making heartfelt promises and taking wonderful care of him. They've stopped caring. He keeps on living his last hours for all of eternity, wondering where his family's gone, why he isn't dying, why is he all alone, is this hell? etc.

As for the crime thing, it should be noted that THEY know where they'll begin as well, and they can go as far away as possible to another place. That said, shunning is a system that makes sense. Especially in what's essentially a very small community, now that you can only travel as far as one can travel in a week without planes (unless you've got a friend who knows how or you know how).

**** I don't think planes would be much of a problem. They don't need to worry much about safety and maintenance anymore. Although they still might worry enough about security to stop the known rapists or whatever kind of terrible criminal that is worth stopping.

*** This is probably an in-joke I'm not getting. Just to reiterate, these are story ideas I wanted to share in the hopes that someone (preferably someone in the rational-scene, which is why I'm posting it here) would pick them up or at least be inspired by, because I don't think I'll be touching them.

**** I just thought the idea of a video that deletes your memories of it is similar to the video I posted. No joke beyond that.
