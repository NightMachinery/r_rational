It would be a completely new Doctor (one of my own design). Where should I put it if I start making it?


** I'm confused: The primary advantage of fanfic is getting to skip all the initial exposition and characterization and exposition because your audience already knows it. If you start off with a new doctor, you have to provide that characterization and context.

Also, I dunno. Spacebattles creative writing? AO3?

*** Fanfic generally falls under *two* primary categories.

1) The author wants to use the characters. The main characters are all the same people but they make different choices, usually at some key event, and the author explores the changes that snowball out from that point and the new choices they make, and how it affects the world. That, or they are used to 'continue' events past whatever work they are found in.

2) The author wants to use the world. The main characters of the original work exist, but are off somewhere else and may not even interact with the new characters. The new characters often have to deal with the fallout of the others choices, and in some cases may actually cause the problems the ones in the original work encounter.

Usually, but not always, an IP's fanfic tends to favor one category over the other. It's my speculation that the reason for this depends on how much and for how long (how many multiple works) the original IP focuses on its main characters.

Things like Harry Potter, Supernatural, or Doctor Who focus on anywhere from one to a small handful of primary main characters, and the entire series tends to be focused on them from beginning to end.

Things like Star Wars or Star Trek, on the other hand, tend to focus on a different, larger groups of characters over time and often changes them out in 'generations' for another group. We often see different sides and viewpoints over time as the group and world changes.

But even if an IP tends to have fanfiction of one type, that doesn't mean you can't write it for the other. Any sufficiently long series will invariably expand its world and have many interesting characters.

**** My intent, or perhaps desire, is to introduce a Time Lord, or maybe another 'doctor' of sorts. I don't know. I have an idea of creating a different personality for a doctor. Not too different from the fact that every doctor has a different personality themselves.

The main interest is to use the world, and have self-contained stories within each chapter. And maybe even at some point, introduce an overarching narrative.

I basically want to copy the basic formula of the show, and put my own spin on it, with a character that's familiar, but different.

***** Sounds like a plan.

In that case, might I suggest you do a new Time Lord who has some sort of connection to the Doctor but a slightly different worldview, personality, and goals? You can ease the character in 'behind the scenes' from a known event involving the Doctor, and branch out from there.

I'll give some examples.

Both I and a friend of mine once had ideas for writing our own Doctor Who stories involving a new Time Lord. The thing was, we weren't friends when we came up with them, but later told each other about it and found out we had done something similar but in completely different directions. We both wanted to do an "Anti-Doctor", focusing on some different aspect of his personality or nature, but came up with wildly different interpretations.

--------------

His version was called the "Healer". Rather than a Doctor who is professional about 'fixing' a problem for the best result, his Healer was more focused on the personal aspect of helping others out in need. He didn't care so much for preventing calamities or worrying about messing up the timeline so much as he cared about helping *people* who were directly affected by tragedies. Where the Doctor tends to be more aloof, the Healer was more caring. Where the Doctor was more introverted, the Healer was more extroverted. Where the Doctor tried not to interfere but, when pressed, would change events when his back was against the wall, the Healer would simply avoid that conflict altogether and save whatever lives he could.

The exterior of his TARDIS always looked like whatever a sufficiently large tree-equivalent was for that world. It's interior was less tech control room and more of a fantasy tavern combined with a Zen garden, and he would have no problem taking individual refugees of calamities on board to find them new homes in the space-timeline. Its personality is generally that of a helpful nursing home assistant with a bubbly personality, and it enjoys visiting places of wonder and beauty to bask in while sharing the view with the current occupants.

--------------

My Anti-Doctor equivalent went a completely different way. Mine was called the Janitor. If a Doctor is a white-collar type who solves people's health problems, then the Janitor was more of a blue-collar type who cleans up the messes of the Time War and other temporal snafu's. The Janitor was never a Time Lord, as he did not become a doctor of anything, but he had hard work ethic and would set his own goals, even if he grumbled constantly about having to do all the real work. The Janitor generally avoided interfering if he could help it (as he would then set himself the task of cleaning up the mess), but sometimes would anyway if doing so would cause less issues farther down the line.

The Janitor's TARDIS was actually a decomissioned military TARDIS equipped with a potent weapon called a "Paradox Corrector". It could not only eliminate targets from the timeline, but also 'correct' all the paradoxes inherent in their erasure. It only used this weapon in war a single time before it flipped out, went rampant, and became an uber-pacifist, vowing never to use its weapon on living targets again. The Janitor lacks the Rassilon Imprimatur (as he never became a Time Lord), but after the War TARDIS witnessed his dedication to his job, it chose to override its programming to allow him to pilot it--the Janitor has been doing so for so long now he just sort of does it by 'feel'. Now, it only ever fires its weapon to correct temporal anomalies once the Janitor has proven beyond doubt that no living being will be adversely affected. Its interior is similar to the ones seen in the show, but its exterior is almost always cloaked in such a way that it appears as the world's equivalent to a Port-A-John or outhouse.

Together, the Janitor and his TARDIS are the /reason/ many of the wibbly-wobbly stuff exists, or that the Doctor and other Time Lords can get away with paradoxical alterations to the timeline. This poor guy goes along behind them to clean up their mess, grumbling all the while, and none of the other Time Lords even know he exists and does the job because he's not on their roster.

--------------

Both my friend and I followed a similar idea (make an Anti-Doctor), but the end results were vastly different. The best part is we did this before we ever met each other, but after we shared our stories, we decided that they existed in the same universe and would sometimes contact each other when they ran into a problem that required the other's specialty.

Bit of a long rant, but hopefully it gives you ideas as to what you can try, if you don't have any already. Focus on your goals and your what you want your main character to be, then build outward from there.

**** There's lots of ways to go with DrWho FF. Having a TARDIS is a convenient plot device for exploring various times and places. Maybe you have a new take on the Cybermen, Daleks, etc..

Years and years ago I had an idea for a 6th Doctor story with Peri. The intent (at the time) was to explain why we don't see much / any use of molecular nanotechnology (MNT) in the universe.

It started with the TARDIS cruising along and hitting a rough patch of spacetime. The Doctor stops and investigates (because he's curious as a cat), and eventually figures out that a portion of the universe has been "pinched off" and a new, small, pocket universe has been created.

The Doctor figures out how to cross over, and does. Inside the pocket universe is a single star system with a few planets. Two are inhabited by a seemingly weird yet technologically advanced "civilizations".

Originally, a small research team was working on MNT, when the Timelords discovered them, decided they were dangerous, and separated them from the rest of the universe because they were afraid of another self-replicating hedgemonizing swarm worse than the Daleks.

The research team split into two groups, one going heavily into AGI, uploading their minds, and making advanced robots. The other group went heavily into human cloning, biological modifications, and such (though they still have some robots and such too). There's a big morality conflict between them as well as a "limited to a single solar system with limited resources" problem.

Both sides see the TARDIS as a ticket out of the pocket dimension, which somewhat resembles [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Wife][The Doctor's Wife]] situation that I saw years later. Shenanigans ensue.

** By a completely new Doctor, do you mean the Doctor has regenerated into a form we have never seen before on-screen, or a different Time Lord character entirely?

If the former, then I think it's fine to set it in the Whoniverse.

If the latter, then, yeah, you should probably do your own thing.

**** I mean, new regenerations are part of the established canon. Each one is still recognizably the same character, the Doctor, while each is also a distinctive, unique incarnation of that character as well. If you can pull that off, I see no reason why you shouldn't. There's enough commonality that readers could go in with an understanding of the character.

Your initial post sounded like it might have been suggesting a new Doctor who wasn't /the/ Doctor, and I agree with the other poster that I don't see what the point would be. With as varied a setting and as wibbly-wobbly a backstory as the Whoniverse has, the main character and premise are the big constants; if you're ditching those, you'd do just as well, or perhaps better, to start from scratch.

** What about instead you rewrite the last tv season, with a serious twist: just, hear me out, ok ?

Missy is mysteriously back and stalking the « fam », always in lockstep with them but helping from behind the figurative curtains, yet clearly trying to get back at the doctor.

Meanwhile the inconsistencies of the female doctor's behaviour (plenty to pick from the tv season there, just repeat and amplify, like her dismissing cancer because awkward) ramp up over time to the point where the companions start being genuinely afraid of her.

In the end you reveal that « the doctor » was really a seriously confused Missy who took the doctor's place and unconsciously adopted their identity out of sheer will to « be good » (be the good one) at the end of the previous season. The « Missy » that was stalking them all is the actual Doctor (but holding some if not most of Missy's actual lost memories, as excessive cumulated regenerations and too woven timelines have mashed and then ‘split' the two timelords wrong, somewhat simultaneously), and has been torn all along between taking the role back, punishing the past Master in the present, and mentoring a worthy successor.

*** I do get where you're coming from with that. Explaining the serious inconsistencies with the most recent doctor is definitely something that could be wanted in a fanfiction.

However, I have a question.

What's stopping you from writing this yourself? It's an amazing idea, and You should write it!!

I would write it, if I didn't already have a structurized idea of what I want with what I might make.

**** Thanks, but the thing is that I'm not a Doctor Who fan, I've simply watched the newer seasons (9th doctor I think ?) and I am only interested in finding ways for fixing bad sequels or prequels of popular franchises (i.e. I have similar concepts for reworking Star Wars, though not a fan of that either).
