The good guys win at the end, the bad guys lose, the Obi-Wan figure dies, the Earth isn't actually destroyed, and the guy with blood coming out of his eyes is, to everyone's surprise, actually evil. There, I spoiled the movie, now you can read this critique.

I think we can all think of tons of irrational tropes, and movies with tons of those, at the top of our heads. /Doctor Strange/ is more than that. /Doctor Strange/ is what would happen if you took a director, told them too make the least rational movie possible (which is prooooobably not unrelated to what happened), and then gave them all the special effects. Like, all of them. So, what we have is a gorgeous movie, using 3D to its fullest, and a nice Marvel movie plot with good action and funny jokes... and I sort of hate it.

Let's start with our protagonist, Doctor Stephen Strange. Two years ago (holy shit time flies) our fine Mr Yudkowsky [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][wrote a guide]] to writing non-clichéd intelligent characters. Dr Strange feels like someone read this guide, and decided to make a character by doing everything the guide tells you to avoid. The man travels all over the world, spends his every last dollar to find the only organization that has a chance of healing his hands... and blows them off almost immediately when he finds them because he doesn't believe their methods. He knows that they have already cured one guy whose injuries where supposed to be beyond medecine's ability to fix, and yet he instantly dismisses them. I wouldn't have done that, Harry JPEV wouldn't have done that. We would have shut our big mouths, and tried to understand what was going on. Ask at least a few questions before insulting and shoving around the only people in the world who might save our hands.

Doctor Strange is clearly not Level 1 smart. He is Level Hollywood smart: he knows lots of science, he's quirky and arrogant, people call him "Doctor", he learns magic really fast off-screen, so clearly we must infer that he's smart. Except we never see him do anything smart. He uses a forbidden spell without even checking the chapter for potential warnings, he has a chat with the trapped bad guy even though he knows his minions might come back at any time, etc.

Which is really symptomatic of how science is treated in the whole movie: as one of several bags of tricks you can draw from when you feel like it. First you draw from the bag "acupuncture", then the bag "herbal medicine", then the bag "radiography, Hollywood defibrillator and internet connection" (but not "guns", for some reason). You never see anyone using something resembling epistemology the whole movie. Doctor Strange never stops to wonder why he previously thought acupuncture was a pseudo-science, when it apparently gives consistently good results. The moral 'dilemma' between the Ancient One and Evil Guy is essentially a matter of "do you side with the Monks tribe or the Evil ex-monks tribe?", and the characters never wonder "Hmm, I wonder what would be the probable consequences of either decisions", or ask Evil Guy "What makes you think Dormammu is actually going to follow through his promises if you feed him the entire world?". I could go on for a while, but at this point it feels like I'm going through a checklist; basically every irrational trope is in this movie.

In conclusion, I'm kind of waiting for EY to write a witty, absurd, irreverent one-chapter fanfic deconstructing this movie now. :p But REALLY THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST.

EDIT: As comments pointed out, I'm being very mean to a decent Marvel movie. I'm aware of that: this post was mostly me venting out of frustration. Again, the movie is pretty good, with amazing visual effects and okay movie stuff (dialogues/acting/sets/whatever). The writing is still annoys me a bit: it's not dumb by action movie standards, but it feels anti-rational and anti-epistemological in a way that irks me.

** Many of your problems with dr strange come from the fact that his backstory was locked in stone back in 1963. He isn't supposed to be a rational or believable character. He is supposed to represent a complex relationship between ability and hubris.

He is a talented character, brought low by his hubris. He travels the world, seeking to fix his problem without atoning for his sins. Only when he is truly humble does the world allow him to live up to his real potential. And whenever he becomes overly full of himself, he loses his powers and aids chaos, as a way of the universe punishing him for hubris.

It's an Aesop's fable. Not a modern, rational piece of fiction.

*** Actually, it sort of is worse. Glossing over important questions is Hollywood's M.O. There's magic, but no one thinks to ask the implications for technology, physics and science in general? That's a Tuesday over there.

Strange, however, asks the questions and then proceeds to utterly mess up answering them. Meeting the Ancient One, the typical Hollywood character would have said something about magic not being real, and then been shown magic, and then boggled at how small-minded they were. A rationalist protagonist would have explained how we're made of matter, the idea of a soul is silly, the universe doesn't care, and asked to be proven wrong.

Strange finds the anti-golden mean. He goes off on a rant about the universe being material and uncaring, just as articulate and sensible as a rationalist, but then proceeds to hold on to this idea religously, relenting only after being mentally thrown across the universe and back.

The Ancient One wasn't being aloof or myserious, she was perfectly willing to explain slowly and clearly to a modern, thinking, questioning person. It was the perfect setup for a rational story, where the protagonist doesn't have to wade through swamps of dogma and vaguely-described mechanics. The stage was set for an intelligent conversation in way you rarely, if ever see in movies, and he had to barge in there with a caricature of reason instead of the real thing.

So yes, it is more dumb than most Hollywood movies. Those are just stupid through and through. This one sets the stage perfectly for the rationalist, and then goes out of its way be dumb.

I found it totally in character that a desperate, embittered, and by now hopelessly cynical Strange would fail to give the outlandish ideas their due in terms of rational examination, instead launching straight into a tirade about the uncaring nature of the universe, a worldview which is totally a projection of his own issues and despairs.

**** Yeah, this movie has a lot of moments where you feel something clever and sensible is about to happen, then it slaps you in the face and mocks you for expecting it to be smart.

For instance, in one scene Strange asks the bad guy "If you are really benevolent, why did you kill people?" That was the perfect setup for a brutal utilitarian response, "I'll kill millions of people if it's what I need to destroy Time and Death! They don't matter compared to the billions, the trillions of people I will save!"; instead we get a callback to Dr Strange's earlier nihilism, "I killed them because they don't matter and they're specks of dust in an uncaring universe.", which is really just a convoluted way of saying "I'm evil and and I don't care about killing people" while sneering at utilitarianism.

I think you're reading way too much into those 'setups'. The movie never even attempts to take itself seriously, and the viewer is expected to pick that up. Hell, the first scene where Strange is operating while being quizzed on random songs is explicitly there to set that tone. All those setups to 'rationalist moments' are just setups for gags.

Like, Cap hadn't met Spidey before, and had no idea how strong Spidey was. Like, obviously in a few minutes of fighting you can tell Spidey is several times stronger than the average person. That doesn't mean he'll definitely be able to hold up several tons. He's also a kid. Cap didn't know that. Was he guessing Spidey would dodge? This wasn't a justified true belief.

Like, there is a different story where Captain America totally just killed a innocent American teenager, superpowers or no, and he is going to prison. This would be a big freaking deal. This has been bugging me for several months."

****** Well, I can play devil's advocate for both of those scenes.

Cap vs Spidey: Cap is an extremely skilled martial artist and has just sparred against Spidey for a bit, in addition to (possibly) observing him in action for quite a while (e.g. artfully dodging flying cars). Spidey seems to be physically superior to Cap in agility and maybe in strength, if not skill, and Cap would have known that.

Thor vs Cap's shield: Why would Thor, a literal alien, be bound by Earthling morals? He's clearly from a warrior culture and has no qualms about killing his enemies in battle. And, he is still holding back both vs Cap and vs Iron Man. If he wanted either of them dead, they'd be dead.

  and blows them off almost immediately when he finds them because he doesn't believe their methods.
#+end_quote

He came there because it was the only lead he had left and it was the only thing he cared about. He accepts whatever mysticism bullshit they have going on and figures it's a cover for an experimental procedure because the idea that it's actually mysticism is highly unlikely. They then get patronising and start showing him random things (it really should be noted that they never say what parts of acupuncture or whatever work, just that they are based on something that actually does work) and tell him that this guy who had severe nerve damage basically learned to walk with a placebo.

This is like someone trying to save their company from financial collapse and then their colleague comes in and says they can get a bailout if they squeeze a rubber duck and jump in a circle. Sure, if Strange wasn't so arrogant he probably would have said something like "well can you prove it?" but he would have been expecting them not to.

Anyway, Swinton shunts his astral body because she's probably used to people having the perfectly logical reaction of disbelieving her and his first thought isn't "oh clearly this proves everything" but instead he assumes he was drugged because that's how these things are typically done. Here is where it's completely proven that magic is actually real and everything he ever knew was a lie and as soon as it happens he accepts it and asks to be taught like a rational person would.

As for him learning to use magic we skip past him learning all the minutia where he reads thousands of pages learning to focus his mind because the movie would have been awful if that wasn't the case.

His character is shown to be arrogant and headstrong time and time again and that's fine because as long as their flaw isn't "stupidity" any flaw can be present in a basically rational character. This is why he just tries out the awesome time manipulation that he just saw because he didn't see any warnings as they come in the end.

He chats with the guy who was completely trapped because he assumes that the minions would already be back if they could. It turns out that he dropped his gate-maker-thing in the desert without noticing so one of the minions finds it after a while.

The defib thing was annoying, the "death is good" was annoying, and how they brushed past some of the "you were born for magic" stuff was annoying. With that said, the evil ex-monks, Swinton, and Mordo all had good points as to why the others were untrustworthy or wrong. The ex-monks argument was based on the fact that Swinton had used Dormammu as a power source for centuries and since she keeps everyone else from doing the same thing it calls everything she says about him into question.

*Overall*, not a rational movie but certainly no less rational than the absolute majority of hollywood movies.

--------------

As an aside, it's not a good idea to tackle someone who says something you think had no value, or should not have been said. Everyone will just look at you oddly and not want to talk to you.

If other people smile and give thumbs up instead of ignoring whatever that person said, then that means what that person said had value to the other people around you. If you disagree, and think they should not value what that person said, again, tackling the person is a bad idea. Rather, clearly explain why you think what they said was not valuable. In doing so, open yourself to and in advance consider compelling arguments that would change your mind. If you're not open to those arguments, then you're trying to fit everyone else in your coin purse and it's really quite stuffy in there so please stop, ow, this hurts, I can't breathe, why are you doing this to us?!

  As an aside, it's not a good idea to tackle someone who says something you think had no value, or should not have been said. Everyone will just look at you oddly and not want to talk to you.
#+end_quote

People don't look at people on the internet.

#+begin_quote
  Rather, clearly explain why you think what they said was not valuable.
#+end_quote

You should be telling this to the guy who originally posted, as I mentioned in my first post I was being cathartic after seeing the fiftieth fucking signalling post instead of anything of actual bloody value.

In fact everything below the line is something you should be saying to the signallers.

************ Reading 5+ comments that are basically variations of "I disagree with the OP" does sting a bit when you are the OP :p

That said, I don't think the several disagreeing comments are out of place. My post was a long and angry message that signaled "DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE". If you think the movie is worth being watched by the people on this subreddit, you might feel that it deserves a strong "this movie is still kinda good" signal, hence the multiple responses.

Aside from that, I agree with TennisMaster2: you could have made your point without being confrontational about it. Of course, um, you're free to communicate however you want. But being less aggressive might have helped you drive your point across. :)

The difference between simple signaling and what you did is someone is on the ground with a ouchie because you tackled them. If someone jumps around saying, "Look at me! Look at me!" you can just look away or say, "Stop, please. We're having a conversation."

This comment, for example, immediately garnered you my agreement. Much more effective than tackling, and no one has a scrape or bruise from the impact.
