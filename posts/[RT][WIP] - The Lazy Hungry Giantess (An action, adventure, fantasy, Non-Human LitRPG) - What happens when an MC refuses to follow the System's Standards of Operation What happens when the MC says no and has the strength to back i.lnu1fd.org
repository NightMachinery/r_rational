Hey, y'all in [[/r/Rational][r/Rational]]! I got something new for you to take a look at. It's called [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40163/the-lazy-hungry-giantess-a-non-human-litrpg][The Lazy Hungry Giantess]], and I'm sure it'll interest a lot of you Redditors who are rational rebels.

  She's sentient, formless, and floating through the black void. It's a serene experience. No worries. No hunger. No abuse. But then an excitable message prompt called the System arrives. It wants her to do things and it won't leave her alone.

  Soon enough, our girl finds herself awaken with a /tall, strong,/ and /curvy/ form. It's a body she'll love to enjoy while relaxing. Unfortunately, there's this thing called hunger. And quests. And monsters. And people who want to control her... or slay her.

  This is the LitRPG tale of a /troubled/ young woman leveling up so she can defend her nap time and eat the things that want to hurt her. She might even make friends along the way while she stumbles into tiresome (but sometimes delicious) misadventures of mayhem.

  It can be hard life when you're a lazy hungry giantess, */especially an OP one./*

​

Sometimes I catch myself reading LitRPG Isekai stories, and I wonder what would happen if the MC refuses to follow along with the System's bullshit? You got to imagine it must be frustrating to be yanked from wherever you were and tossed into a fight-for-your-life, dog-eat-dog, extreme survivalist setting.

I hope you guys don't mind me self-promoting here since I plan to post frequent updates going into the future. The updates will follow a character who will say NO to the powers that be while throwing her weight around.

Consequently, she pushes the plot rather than let the plot push her, steering away from a story that wanted her involved in a war and focusing the story on her wanting to eat and nap and do as she pleases.

Now that ultimately sounds simple. You're a slothful, gluttonous person who likes to take it easy and enjoy life. But you have the potential of great power, and due to that, some forces wish to manipulate you or kill you because of that power, which is no fault of your own.

That's the MC's case in the Lazy Hungry Giantess. From the moment we meet her, her first word, like a child, is literally "NO." Yet, the System doesn't listen to her, and that leads to a whole lot of trouble for multiple parties involved.

I like the concept because Rhonda is the ultimate super power-fantasy (which gets super literal in a psychological way early in the series) while having her own unique sensibilities. She asks for the basic things she wants in life: food, sleep, and fun times and gets constant push-back.

She doesn't want to fight. She doesn't want to be abused or to abuse others. But she quickly adapts to her circumstances while also being true to what she wants. All while giving the System and the world she's pulled into a big F.U.

This is why I'm posting this for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] since Rhonda rebels against an obvious abuser of power and doesn't stray from her own rationale.

Yes, this will cause her pain and hard times. But she'll grow (also quite literal) stronger and develop in a way that will certainly surprise people. She may be a Giantess, but when she falls, she actually tends to bounce back up.

Here's the link to the [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40163/the-lazy-hungry-giantess-a-non-human-litrpg/chapter/626410/chapter-1-the-start-of-an-annoying-adventure-of][First Chapter]] to get you started. Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you!


** Good luck with your story, but I wouldn't really call it rational. The magic system is very soft, edging into surreal, and the story and characters seem to bend to the themes you want to show, rather than the themes emerging from a self-consistent story. There are also quite a lot of really uncomfortable sexual moments that stray into unusual fetish territory. This for the most part seems less like a rational story and more like a surreal giantess fetish story.

** Can i just that it's kind of wierd for there to be an expectation that going against larger built up powers is somehow rational? Like it almost always is a trope in a story for the underdog to win, but practically speaking the vast majority of times the larger power base crushed the smaller one regardless of who holds the moral high ground. Like sure it makes for a better story to not swear fealty to a large power and lose most of your say in how things go. Like for one in particular the quest Now you feel like Number None is about being like mook in a world of mook slayers like of course its reasonable to put yourself under a great power for safety. I don't necessarily enjoy that story but it's completely rational to act in that way. I wouldn't make the argument that the one moment makes the whole thing rational but that moment of choosing to lose ones autonomy in exchange for safety makes a lot of sense.
