** There's a fair amount of meat left on the bone with this episode, and it's likely that we'll do a follow-up on it at some point in the future, covering stuff like:

- Intersectionality (almost no one is a central example of a group, and is rarely defined by only their (willing or unwilling) membership to a single group, we might get to this in a future episode on sex and gender in fiction instead)
- Default frames
- Racism and other bigotry as "cartoonish" (something that I've seen a lot lately, and want to talk about, e.g. why people have this view, what you can do with writing to avoid it)
- Bad tropes and things to avoid
- Writing with history in mind

If there's anything that you'd like us to talk about that we didn't cover in this episode, let us know here.

(We've already recorded an episode about species.)

** I think you guys are wrong about the "post-racial wonderland" approach. Race is brought up all the time, just not in a way people of the target demographic are likely to notice. Any character who's of any other demographic is just forced into the same box to force a particular impression, but it's going to be a different impression for the target demographic vs those who notice. It's more of a "white man's wonderland."

*** There are definitely situations like that, probably even most of them, but I think the default example I'd go with is Star Trek. Race exists, but in basically every appreciable sense, just doesn't matter. There are of course periphery factors like "how many of the main characters are white" that usually come as a result of the time period or social norms the show arises from, but it was explicitly modeling a world in which humanity is post-racial, and they did a lot to show that both in-universe and through the writing and casting of the show.

**** For what it was, Star Trek was a very progressive show. Having the first black woman portrayed in a professional type job was huge. But I don't think I've ever seen Uhura interact with another black person. I definitely haven't seen her drop the "act this way or the cops will shoot you" act, even behind closed doors. She has to fit perfectly into this "white person" box, and any aspects of her racial identity that don't fit don't have a place in this supposed wonderland.

Where any person does display traits of their ethnicity or race in their actions or behaviors, such as Scotty's accent, it's often there to create comedic relief rather than to create a feeling of racial diversity or inclusiveness. Maybe there was something different in those episodes I didn't get to see, but from the more general theme I doubt it.

Again, not dissing Star Trek. It was a great show and very progressive for its time. If that's the best example of a "post racial wonderland" then it shows that wonderland is pretty much always a "white man's wonderland" in everything but name.

***** Ahh I see your point better now. I think that opens a different can of worms up though, like our brief discussion of the phrase "acting white." A lot of black people don't actually identify with the sort of behavior that others might intrinsically associate with them, and it's hard to make any sort of judgement call on that sort of thing /for/ other people. Did it bother you that Sulu didn't "act Asian" or talk to other Asian characters? If not, why not?

To be clear, I think both equality /and/ diversity as its own metric are good to maximize, so I don't disagree with you in principle. But when it specifically comes to far-future, ostensibly post-racial societies, the lack of identifiable modern earth cultures is often a feature, not a bug.

(There's another potential problem buried in there, where "white culture" is treated as the "default," but I think you get what I mean?)

****** I think we're actually getting away from my point. The question of what makes up the default culture is kind of central to it.

Race is brought up every time there is an opportunity for someone to behave in a way that does or does not match their cultural values and upbringing, whether one likes it or not, and whether one notices or not. You'll notice more often when you're familiar with the relevant cultures, and another person will notice the ones they're familiar with. And that's ok (if I'd been close to more Asian kids when I was into star trek would the first thing I remembered been the fact that there are like 5 asian people in all of Starfleet even though most people on real earth are asian? Maybe so. Others certainly have and it's a good point.)

Think about what it means when a character in a diverse cast always chooses to go against what a reasonable person with a matching background would expect. There are lots of reasons this might happen, and if it's an MC subverting expectations in a particular way or with a particular pattern it may even be a statement. Next, think about what it means when /every/ such character in such a cast subverts similar expectations by similar people, relevant to their own background. Finally think about what it means when every such character in such a cast does that, /except the British wealthy class ones./

The first is a rebel and understandable, but maybe not relevant to a discussion about how groups are represented overall. The second is an attempt at such a wonderland, if a bit jarring at first, and likely to upset people before they get what's going on. But it's a clear attempt. The third is a clear message by whoever made that call, that "this is not for you."

Now, everyone has their unconscious biases. The default culture will end up being whatever the author, editor, writers, or whoever don't think to question. Unfortunately, this eliminates the possibility of the second scenario above, and attempting it leads to the third scenario. Thus a post-racial wonderland where race doesn't matter is impossible to put into your writing, unless it's only a wonderland for a certain group or demographic.

As an aside, the opposite approach may make great alien worlds or feel of unfamiliarity. Start with a list of all racial and cultural identities, and roll a d10000 for each aspect of world building. Cabbage based staple foods, rickshaws for public transport, teepee based architecture, Traditional southern USA clothing, and so on, in the same place, is just familiar enough to make the combination seem even more strange and unfamiliar than if you'd just made stuff up.

******* I get what you're saying, and I definitely think that "post-racial wonderland" can definitely be that, depending on how it's written. Sometimes "post-racial wonderland" means that everyone has conformed to whiteness, with all traces of culture and style ripped out, and the white racial frame completely dominating, with racial concerns erased from the picture.

And even if the intent is to posit a fictional world where everyone is colorblind, where there is no discrimination, bigotry, or prejudice, there are problems with that too, partly because it's a fantasy that pretends problems don't exist, partly because it will necessarily mean at least /some/ erasure of minority races, since discrimination, bigotry, and prejudice are one of the defining features of that experience.

And yeah, one of the failure modes of writing "the other" is to pour the non-other into their skin, or if you're attempting the post-racial wonderland, to have it be majority white, or inside the white frame. Sometimes achieving that wonderland happens by just stripping out things like heritage and culture, leaving only phenotypes. All you have is the default frame ... which is white.

I do think there's some merit to a media crit idea of a post-racial wonderland though, in the sense of writing about race in such a way that you pretend to the audience that the social construct of race either doesn't exist or doesn't matter. There are problems with it, both from a theoretical perspective and an as-used-in-practice perspective, but it's something that people do make attempts at.

(This is one of the reasons that 'default frame' is on the docket for a follow-up, because I think it's a complicated thing.)

******** It's something people attempt but the likelihood of success with that approach is so low that it may as well be folded into the category you get when the author fails to convey a perspective they don't properly understand.
