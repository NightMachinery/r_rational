** random life thing I started doing when I feel like people are going to judge me and feeling anxiety.

Don't think of what people think of you, think of what they are going to do.

Detach their actions from you or judgement of you and just prepare and act based on their predicted actions.

This seems to help me with the tendency to think other people are always thinking and judging me that characterizes when my social anxiety is acting up.

I think they'd adapt nicely to ordinary superintelligent plotting (for us not-so superintelligent players and GMs), with some slight change in resources and terminology.

** I've been thinking about stereotyping and discrimination lately (spiders ahead). Specifically, about when a society should punish/shun those who discriminate or stereotype others.

The obvious cases that should be looked down on are where the beliefs are false or the actions are either ineffective or counterproductive. I can't think of anything that's obvious and non-controversial in the other direction.

I'm more interested in the edge cases, and trying to figure out where they are and why. For example, we strongly condemn racism and sexism in general, but allow it in specific cases, like insurance companies charging young men more for car insurance.

*** The libertarian argument (the reason that Ron Paul opposed specific parts of the Civil Rights Act) is that people should be free to discriminate however they'd like on whatever basis they see fit. If I own a business and only want to allow _____ as customers and/or employees, that should be completely up to me. In other words, it's none of the government's business whether I'm barring _____ from buying meat at my butcher's shop. I shouldn't have to give any reason. If people really dislike this practice, they'll stop coming to my shop and the free market will do its job.

That is/was the argument, anyway. I don't really buy it because the consequences don't seem optimal to me, but that describes a lot of my relationship with libertarianism.

At any rate, I think it's important to distinguish what we mean by a society punishing people. Do we mean the state making laws against discrimination? Do we mean people boycotting? Negative publicity? Something else?

*** You might punish "innocent" stereotyping in order to strongly signal that all stereotyping is bad. This becomes an extra good idea if people are bad at distinguishing true stereotypes from false ones.

On the other hand, there might be times stereotyping should be subsidized. Suppose that a generalization is untrue but has useful consequences for people's behaviors. You might promote such generalizations, if you're utilitarian.

Also, we need to consider that sometimes we're not faced with a decision between the status quo and one option, but between the status quo and many different options. Stereotyping might be beneficial or detrimental in some narrow sense, but this narrow sense would collapse if you looked at context more broadly. For example, maybe there are short term negative consequences or inaccuracies caused by affirmative action, but these short term effects are outweighed by longer term effects. Or, maybe your goal is to temporarily make racism worse, so that everyone will unite against it in a glorious revolution, rather than engage in halfhearted piecemeal reform.

Personally, I think it's better to try to change people's beliefs than to incentivize them to suppress those beliefs. So I don't really think we should do much to subsidize, shun, or intentionally manipulate people's beliefs about stereotypes in any way, even in very obvious cases. I prefer removing bad beliefs or social inefficiencies directly over compensating for them with second-order moves. I do concede that there's probably some role for social influences or government propaganda efforts to cause beneficial changes to society, but it's not something I spend my time on. Toying with people's values or beliefs makes me feel queasy, even when it's for a good cause. So I mainly use the tool of argumentation, and leave other tools alone.

Consider [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/12/01/setting-the-default/#comment-273395][this comment]] from Slate Star Codex.

In most areas of society, it's very hard to nail down what the /correct/ level of discrimination is, and anyone attempting to apply a nonzero level of discrimination will almost always overshoot. Furthermore, rules have to be enforceable, and "on average, employers should discriminate only this much" is very hard to enforce. So the enforced threshold for fuzzy, non-quantitative actions like job interviews or etc is zero. The law does not trust you to apply base rates correctly.

But actuaries are /the/ quant profession. It's very straightforward to adjust rates by exactly the correct amount to account for men on average getting in more car accidents than women (or whatever), and not a penny more or less.

I think it takes some contortion to call this "sexism". Men pay more for insurance, as do people with a history of accidents, teenagers, etc. Insurance doesn't even work unless you can accurately account for risk.

You could pass laws that say "you can't charge for different levels of risk based on gender specifically", but then the actuaries just split the cost across everyone, instead of adjusting cost for risk like they do in every other case. It's not clear to me that charging for /gender-based/ risk is less fair than charging for any other kind of risk.

Finally, you have a choice: if we want most people to be insured, insurance must be mandatory or we must allow discriminatory (as in, correlated with risk) premiums. Otherwise lower-risk individuals will tend to be under-insured, depending on their risk profile.

You could understand eg public healthcare as a mandatory scheme with premiums paid according to the tax system rather than risk profiles. This has some issues, but most developed nations agree that the public good of good public health outweighs the downsides.

It would push the price of the cheaper insurance up while pushing the price of the more expensive insurance down. In theory, anyway. Low risk people would be subsidizing high risk people, meaning high risk people are helped.

******** The point of insurance is that the duration that low risks do not demonstrate themselves subsidize the duration that they do. Over time this is ergodic per individual, and costs and benefits weigh out for all parties individually. People pay premiums according to their risk, and an imbalance in that risk means proportionately-imbalanced premiums and payoffs, premiums due to the judgement, payoffs due to the demonstration of the risk. Level off the premiums, though, and lower-risk insurees pay more than they should, higher-risk insurees pay less, and the payouts remain the same according to the demonstration of risks.

Effectively this imbalance means that there are people paying other people money for the sake of 'gender equality,' which makes no sense as equal treatment would dictate that people are equally judged by risk factors. Probabilities are blind. Lower-risk insurees will become uninsured altogether because the premiums are /literally not worth it,/ especially over a period of time. They're being Dutch-booked.

(Hypothetical) A high-risk woman pays an equal premium to a low-risk man. Over time, the woman makes more claims than the man because she is higher-risk. She gains more money than she puts into the system. The man makes less claims and puts more money into the system than he gains. Over the whole population, the money put in and gotten out is the same, but people are individual actors, and lose or gain money due to this system.

A system where high-risk men are charged higher premiums than low-risk women, or vice versa, is /more equal/ than the system where men are charged the same as women. More importantly, it makes sense for everyone in that system to have insurance, instead of the second system where only the high-risk gender has insurance and have higher premiums /anyway./ At that point you are simply depriving the low-risk gender of fair insurance, and probably insurance altogether.

People do not subsidize everyone of the same gender. There are many risk factors and gender is one of them. But when you have a Dutch book like this, it becomes a form of taxation, and not necessarily a progressive tax at all. Assuming that men are being paid more than women, and are higher-risk than women, you have women subsidizing the already-richer men, when the premiums and payoffs were balanced in the first place. Taxation should only be used by the government, and only to reduce market externalities and inefficiencies.

********* But if everyone just pays exactly what their risk is, you don't have an insurance company. You'd have a collection of savings accounts and loan guarantees. We can reasonably well predict total costs, so you'd just tell people "save $x every month" to cover it and if you have an accident sooner than expected, you'd get a loan, which would be paid back by that $x you're saving every month.

Insurance is a game of risk pooling. In order for it to be useful, some kind of group has to be put together into a shared group, whether that be behavioral, or type of car, or gender, or whatever. You're pooling the risk between multiple individuals. People paying "more than they ought to" is the point. Some folks will because it's statistically unlikely everyone will eventually need it, but everyone is forced to buy it. This is why auto insurance is mandatory, you need the low-risk people to pay in, without taking out to keep it affordable. Insurance is not a good idea individually, it's a good idea collectively. You can make those groups smaller, if you want, but it does it's job best when you make the groups as large as possible. Though I suppose small groups benefit the insurance company entity. Some people are decidedly disadvantaged, because of the nature of insurance. The goal is to get as wide a group as possible so that you minimize individual harm.

That /is/ insurance, on an individual level. Risk pooling is taxation; lower-risk members of the risk pool are being Dutch-booked to subsidize higher-risk members who would otherwise be unable to pay their premiums. This should instead be accounted for in the tax system.

*********** Okay, but insurance, as people use the term, refers to the risk-pooling entities we call insurance companies. They carry other benefits such as lowering the unit cost of repairs and the like through bulk negotiation. Taxing through that mechanism limits the ability of other interests to squander the money.

You make it sound like taxes are bad. In this case, I'm more likely to be hit by a high-risk driver than a low-risk one. So I want them to be able to pay for the damages. Sure, I get somewhat less benefit when they pay for the damages, because I've subsidized them, but the subsidy makes it more likely they have insurance at all and can pay me anything.

If high-risk drivers had to pay their own way, it seems more likely that without some sort of state intervention, they wouldn't have insurance. Or, they get priced out of the driving game because they can't afford their insurance costs and because of American (though it exists to lesser degrees elsewhere) development habits and attitudes towards public transit, that means they'd get priced out of a lot of employment opportunities. Besides the benefit of more people in the economy ideally bringing prices closer to equilibrium and maybe an increase in things called crime as these people turn to less ideal forms of employment and the subsequent increase in law enforcement costs, I'm not inclined to believe the arbitrary distinction of 'self' that says it's okay to screw over other people because they're not me. Society is a very complicated beast and I can't say with much certainty which parts of it we can just exclude.

************* It's not like it's really that hidden in an insurance premium. The way they function is not a trade secret, nor all that difficult to understand. Whether you have to explain the statistics behind insurance or why there's a 1% increase in the tax bill.

On the other hand, where would this tax be moved to? Income or sales or property tax hardly seems appropriate, because non-drivers would be forced to subsidize. I'm not aware of any practical way to only tax drivers. Fuel taxes disproportionately hit professional drivers, who are on the average, lower-risk. Licensure or registration fees being increased sounds pretty similar to just paying a higher premium, the cost is still effectively hidden though it would hit people with more cars, who might correlate to higher risk but that seems a poor mechanism compared to actuary-driven insurance premiums. I guess you could try to tack on some sort of fee to filing accident reports, though that sounds like it would just encourage people to not notify the authorities and cause more hit and run incidents.

***** I imagine the insurance people having a big multidimensional bracketing system to divide drivers into demographic buckets, so it would collapse one of those axes, so that they have to give [middle-aged, low-income, high-mileage, 1 accident in the last 3 years, no motoring convictions, self-employed people who use their car for social trips, business and commuting and want comprehensive insurance for a newish car with a good safety record and a small engine] the same rate regardless of gender.

Then the price charged to each bucket is based on the total costs generated by people in that bucket. Assuming a gender-skew to those costs, forcing a bucket that's split 50/50 on gender lines to stop discriminating would result in higher premiums for the women and lower premiums for the men, whereas a bucket dominated by one gender or the other won't see much of a change.

My point is that they still have plenty of dimensions to calculate your risk along, even without gender in the mix. Some of those dimensions may even end up effectively recreating gender discrimination through the indirect route of the genders being unequally distributed along other insurance-relevant axes.

In the longer run, women live longer than men and, even excepting that, tend to use more end-of-life care than men do.

Note, too, that before mandated insurance in the US, and even when health insurance prices for women were significantly higher than those for men, women were still 15% more likely to have insurance coverage. Much of this was because women were more likely to work jobs with employee health-coverage, but the higher costs did not seem to dissuade either women or their employers.
