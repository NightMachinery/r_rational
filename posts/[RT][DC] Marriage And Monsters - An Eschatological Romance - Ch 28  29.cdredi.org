Yeah no. Not even close.

Edit: OH! you meant "The Stirring Cauldron" lol. I thought you meant M&M, my bad.

*** I don't know, dumbledore seems pretty woke, even for a metafanfictional peek behind the curtain. For my crack theory, snap decides to honor lily instead of spite james, and decides to prepare harry the best way he knows how: potions.

"Stirring Cauldrons" therefore has multiple meanings: the literal one, and "stirring shit up". After all, it's clear that dumbledore is trying to repress magical knowledge, and potions are a doozy. Look at all of the trouble the twins could have gotten into, just when they were interested in pranks!

** I got serious chills with the description of the hub, juxtaposed with the last chapter. A few minutes to cross the world, with the zombie brain virus, combined with expanding territories... is a recipe for disaster.

  And Sean,” he was suddenly staring me in the eyes despite my best intentions, and I felt three inches tall, “ /Do not get involved with the students romantically/. Do I make myself clear?” I nodded hastily and he smiled, and led me away.
#+end_quote

Oh god, oh no.

Sean, you fool.

You asked a /teenage girl/ to /consciously, deliberately/ include you in a /fanfiction/.

Think of your wife, Sean. Think of her /hard/.

Because Snape is going to grind on you even harder.

** At one point I was expecting chapter 29 to end with a call to action; for the audience to go write harry potter fanfic that included Sean.

*** That does bring up a great idea, though. If any of us readers /do/ write fanfic involving Sean, he'll be able to enter those worlds and use whatever powers we give him access to.

Obviously it's up to Sasparilla which ones Sean enters, and the M&M storyverse is different from the "real" storyverse as evidenced by the fact that [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22922848-dragon-wife][/Dragon Wife/]] is unfortunately not about Sean and Haley. But it's still fun to think about.

*** He doesn't. But that doesn't actually mean anything in the face of the narrative. The pocket dimension wasn't something that could be punched out of and there wasn't a big horned monster. At least, not until Superman grabbed the monster and threw it through the side and then punched his way out.

** I, ah, got inspired part way through chapter 29 when Sean has to figure out how to invite himself into a story as basically a self-insert and, well, took that as an invitation to, ah... self-insert? :D:

--------------

Los Angeles, and the words had run away with me again. It was about a girl - it was /always/ about a girl, but at least it wasn't about /that/ girl. They'd run away, leaving me, well - not in a lurch, never that, sometimes perhaps a cul-de-sac as the loops of syllables sorted themselves out - but, something like sated.

 

Something named is something (k)new - and here, they (the words, not some otherwise unmentioned plurality) took a moment, as a wave is contemplative before it broke - when something /else/ broke. I experienced something that wasn't vertigo, a sensation that wasn't that cinematic flip of the camera used to show the audience that the world was going funny, the one that leaves you feeling like you should be falling off the ceiling the floor has become - and it wasn't that because that's not actually what it's like but /also/ it wasn't that because

/also/ -

this time -

this time something /settled/ in that sensation. The world didn't un-flip, the imagining didn't subside. It contemplated.

/I/ contemplated. Something named is something (k)new, after all, and the naming's not about the words but about the comprehension -

the name of air is a breath, the name of water a sensation. I contemplated, and felt, and breathed. In-breath, absorb the world; out-breath, return to it.

 

The world didn't un-flip, the imagining didn't subside, and my words stood outside my window.

 

"Huh", I said.

 

"H̩ͥ̓̌͑͛̏ͨ͢ű̸͉̼̙̯͕ͨ͒ͪ̓h̴̺̤̳͔̆ͣ̌̓̆͒̐́", echoed my words.

 

This T͇̠̰͚̐̔͒͆̾͆̉h̠̳͖̘͍̉ͦ͒i̝̭͉͑̉͆̉̄ͅs̬͔̮̱̝̫ͥ is iͧ͛ͦ̏̾̊͑ṣ̗͔̐ͫ͐̃̌̿ an a̠̰̣͍͎͔̅̑̊͗͆ͥ̎n͎̼̻̤͔ͨ͗ interesting ỉ̤̝̮̝͙̗̾̿̂ͩ̚nͦ̚̚t͍̮͖̹͈̟e̘ŕ̮͖̭̥̠̳e͚͉̪͈̥̘̚s̎͛̃̃̚t̠͎̩̹̖͕̦͊i͔̦̻̻̫̮̰̅ͧͮn̰͉͖͍ͨ̎̿͆ͨg̓̇̄ͦ̔͑̓ turn t͖̱͎̫̮̲̭͊ͦ͊̽̌̇u͎͈̥̜̗͈̺͊ͭ̉̌r͈̪͈̚ṉ̥̠̥̆̔̒̈̓ͫͫͅ of ō͈͊ͤͬͪ̋f͓͈̬͕̖ͭͣ̔̉ events e̩̱͍͓̦̳ͣͦv̙̫̈̃̔̈̾ě̮̱̼̭͓͇̠ͨͩ́̆̃̎n͖̗͍̳̻͌̄̈͗̉̏ͯt̩̯̲̃ͤ̅̾͐̃s; I thought. It was a little tricky, like speaking over your own voice when the speakers lagging just a bit behind the mic, and trick was - well, the first trick was just to ignore the other voice, but, - ț̲̰ͭͭ̄̿ͨh̴̤̳̾ͪ͑͒ͦͧe͈̜̟͉̦̥͗̔͊ͧ̚ /better/ t͡r̷̃́̾͗ͮͣíͩͩͬͪc̈́ͨ͛̚k̡ͨ́ͩ͛͆ was tͭ̆͛o͐́ kind of l̳͎e̤̹͙͎̖͞ạ̵n̖̲ ̲̦̟̯͙͍̖i͏̰̯̞̪͖̬n͇̫̠̖͞ - which I did, although I don't think I /actually/ moved, in the world, with my body - into it, and you'd find, t͞ha͏t yo͏ų'd ̛k̴íǹd̡ o̕f ̷s̷t̷a̴r͜t̀, /syncing/ up. The w̸̸̢o̸̵҉ŗ͜͡d̶̢͘͝s̵̢̕ didn't exactly stop l̺͉͙̬̟a̘̱̼g̴͈̟̠̪͕g̪̫͍̠͉͚͙in̩̮g̲̘͉̹, but the lag b͢ec̸a̵͝m͏e̛͝ part of the sound, like s̕o͝m̸et͘h͟i͢͞nģ͢͞ that wasn't a backup singer, although the back and forth as we worked out this interchange wasn't in just one s̕p̛a͟n҉ of time.

I reached out. Touched the window, and with my invitation - a trickle at first and then a stream as something I'd imagined but hadn't yet fit in took place -

the w̶̸̢̡͉̼̤͔̻̞̫͈̭̣̟̮̻̬̺̬̭̅̎͗ͭ͌̎̍̀̚ͅo̷̷̘̙̰̬̭͚̬͕̞̟̼̱̒͊ͣ̊̀̚͞͞r̛̟̬̥̣̦̼̘͔̞̯̰̔͋̄̎͛̀̊̀̓̓̎̾͋͢͢d̖̯̦͙̣͙͉̗̥̩̺͖̩̠̮̘̱̐̋̎̓̂ͪ̓ͭ͋ͧ͑͐ͤ́͞šͯͯ҉̧̣͈̜̙̳̙͡, they... streamed /into/ me through the wrists and through the eyes down the veins and across the skin, all in a mad rush,

like an avalanche of ink and I breathed out consonants and cried syllables and long vowels shown, radiant, from where my eyes used to be

(don't worry, they'll be back in a moment, it's a transformation sequence!)

and my hands turned up in supplication to ecstatic /beoming/ and back I went as nothing but narrative cradled me

like a bean bag

made out of antigrav.

 

In breath, absorb the world; out breath, return to it.

 

The doorbell startled me out of the chair that wasn't. I got up and answered.

 

"Well", said Sean. "This is interesting. And, thanks for the invitation, I guess?"
