** And then Goku used what he learned in this chapter to invent the Taiyouken independently from Tenshinhan, and their inevitable encounter wherein both variants are demonstrated will be kinda awkward, depending on what mood Ten is in at the time. :)

The full magnitude of how much crap they're in, just for being in this universe, is one of those things that reminds me of the author's note from HPMoR that said something like: "To my knowledge, no manuscript has ever been returned with a message from the editor saying 'this villain is too powerful and needs to be weakened.'" It being the Dragonworld... Dragonverse? Zenoverse? ... dampens that somewhat, because the solution in the original was to get really mad and hit things really hard. It makes the tension less "can they win?", and more "can the author make it work in a satisfying way that feels right by the original, while still being more rational?" Which seems kinda unfair, but it is an illustration of how much better tension works in this fic, since it takes threats seriously.

*** Dragon World is usually the accepted term in my experience. I think the original also had some actually quite interesting parts in terms of tension and struggles other than straight up combat. The first part of the Namek arc comes to mind, where Gohan and Krillin have to act stealthily and build alliances with Namekians under the threat of much stronger enemies they have no hope to fend off in a direct confrontation. But in the end, it always boiled down to "and then Goku punched people really really hard", which while it made for some pretty spectacular fights, yeah, it's not always super compelling from a narrative viewpoint.

I think all shounen manga that came after learned that lesson and integrated it in their plot, giving greater relevance to characters other than the protagonist and conflicts other than straight up brawling. Then of course many came up with their own sort of problems, but that's another story.

** I've gotta say, I like this fic a lot better than most "rational" fanfics. Usually, I feel like the phrase "rational fanfic" translates to "come watch this precocious child conquer the world with the super power of being able to name logical fallacies!" It tends to result in a protagonist that's pretty flat, makes the rest of the characters look very stupid, and causes the story as a whole to come off as rather soapboxy.

This story isn't like that. Goku and Bulma are both pretty smart, but not in the traditional "rational fanfic" way of ranting about being rational while everyone else looks on in awe. Goku's a deep thinker more interested in the philosophical than the material who tends to get lost in his own head, and as a result he's usually fascinated by other people's ideas and arguments, more interested in hearing them out and learning more about them than proving them wrong. Bulma is, in many ways, his opposite. Brash, headstrong, and quick tempered, she has very little patience for people who won't see things her way or help her achieve her goals. They're both complex, interesting characters who are smart, but are also /more/ than just "that smart kid." They help explore the idea of "what if this setting actually made sense" while also having their own stories and conflicts, instead of being reduced to just mouthpieces for the author.

Basically, I really like what you're doing here. Keep up the good work!

** This one is a breather chapter, and I wrote it with my mood dominated by rather dark thoughts - mostly, the contradictory feelings born of enjoying a very hot summer while knowing that this very hot summer is indeed the hottest ever recorded, and that is the harbinger of very unpleasant things. I think you can well see how the contrast between fun and looming sense of doom underlies the whole chapter, which makes it perhaps the most personal yet.

I also posted it rather quickly because, well, during the holidays I had time to write and bring myself a bit ahead with the work. And considering that nothing much of actual consequence happens in it, I thought it'd be better to just post it quickly, in order to keep people waiting less for the next, more plot relevant chapter (which will come hopefully in two weeks as usual).

** Honestly, I understand the goal, but I think that in this particular case their approach to not telling people abou tthe danger is foolish. They found out their current supers squad just by /asking/. In an ad. As far as they know, there are plenty more people like Spike or whatever just bumming around, which isn't entirely right but isn't far off; even if we discount the lookout group, there's the crane school with Tao, Tien, Chaiotzu, Shen, as well as lone actors like Krillin (will be recruiting himself, but they can't see that coming) and Yajirobe.

*** They know about Krillin, he's with Muten. But for the rest, well, the King's councillors aren't entirely sold on the reality of this whole affair, so it's also about saving face for them if in the end nothing happens. The crisis they /do/ know about is the RR vs. Instruments situation, and that they see mostly as a convenient opportunity to get rid of both in one fell swoop.

(but obviously I agree in general that not telling people /was/ wrong and foolish, it's kind of the whole point of the chapter. It's just that Bulma isn't at liberty to change that)

*** Wait, what? No, sorry, that was just a mistake. What happened was the following:

- all the names of characters in Gohan and Videl's class followed a pattern of Engrish words representing items of stationery;
- I didn't immediately find a reference/remember that specific girl was already called Erasa;
- I just made up an Engrish word for what was supposed to be an /original/ character that also happened to be a high school girl, as a homage to that pattern, using the word 'eraser' as a base.

So it was just an episode of convergence. Well, more than one person can have the same first name, so I suppose it's fine, if slightly confusing. Sorry for that!

**** IIRC, there are other people named Bulma in canon, according to the episode where Goku first goes to West City. There's also some stuff Toriyama did for... I forget what, Shenron Times? Some "where are they now?" Q and A shorts for past opponents, in which Lanfan was said to have married a guy named Trunks.

So if multiple underwear-based named people are out there, there's no reason there can't be multiple stationary-based named people.

** What actually happens if you destroy one of the dragon balls?

I think they threaten to destroy a few in canon and they become inert a few times because Kami, Piccolo and/or Guru are dead, but I don't think any of the dragon balls ever actually get destroyed.

*** They're supposedly invincible. No idea if that holds true at the highest levels, but we've seen them hit twice by people stronger than current Goku (Taopaipai and Namek!Krillin) so I suspect he wouldn't have much luck.

**** It never happens in canon, but no one seems to think they're invincible. Taopaipai does indeed hit one with the Dodonpa and that shields Goku, but it only means they're stronger than that (which is indeed pretty strong). Namek!Krillin /tries/ to destroy one, but Guldo snatches it from him before he can actually do so. All present at the scene give for granted that yes, he /could/ destroy it in theory. Later on, Piccolo tells Gotenks to go easy when he starts rampaging to kill Majin Buu, remembering that if he goes overboard he might destroy a Dragon Ball and so no resurrecting anyone (now that I think about it it's a bit weird he should mention that since at that time they ought to believe that Dende is dead; he really isn't, Popo tossed him off the Palace, but they don't know that).

So in other words it's a big question mark. I'd say it's at least reasonable to assume they aren't indestructible, in which case, if one is broken, whether the whole set goes back to stone or not they're unusable anyway. If they're indestructible then there's a whole another class of uses possible for them other than granting wishes...

***** There was a discussion a month or two ago about ways to utilise a totally indestructible object. Seems to me that it must either have perfect elasticity, which means it could store arbitrary amounts of kinetic energy, or else perfect rigidity, which... I'm not sure of all the ways that would break our normal understanding of physics.

*** I recall some supplementary factoid somewhere that stated a damaged dragonball is restored to normal either after a wish is made, or after the cooldown year is up. This was to explain Roshi and Yajirobe apparently making them fit on necklaces. I think it came from Toriyama, but it really doesn't help answer the question, since how can they block a dodonpa but be pierced by presumably weaker, mundane means? How could they heal after the year if being shattered makes wish-granting impossible? Does that render it inert as though a wish were made?

Sometimes, Toriyama's out-of-panel tidbits just make things /more/ confusing. See also: "tails are recessive," which would mean that either Chichi is a Saiyan, or Saiyans and Earthlings are more closely related than the fact that they can reproduce would suggest on its own.
