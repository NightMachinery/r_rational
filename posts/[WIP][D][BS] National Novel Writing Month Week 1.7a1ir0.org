This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for [[http://nanowrimo.org/][National Novel Writing Month]], which starts November 1st.

- Want to check in on making some progress?
- Want to talk about what you're writing?
- Out of ideas and want some help?
- Just need to vent about your story?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

** Soooo, here's a copy of the first [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Ixd02wGrskTA1u12UWykwBkLsB-yzPqABUkZf0JE-s/edit?usp=sharing][chapter]] in my Scooby-Doo fanfiction.

I feel like it's cheating including this in my word count, since I wrote this several months ago, but the second chapter is almost done and I'll post that tomorrow or late tonight with more than 3,333 words.

There has been some pretty major changes in the gang's backstories (more like nothing). So I'm making up some fairly unusual ones and created a 'contradiction' in each of their personalities for each of them to deal with. I suggest reading the chapter I posted before looking at the spoilers.

[[#s][Shaggy]]

Scooby-Doo's 'contradiction' will be posted with the second chapter and Fred's and Daphne's are for the third chapter.

Feel free to weigh in with any comments on how I'm writing the characters. My biggest worry is not having the right 'voice' for my characters.

Also should I be writing Scooby-Doo, or Scooby Doo? I'll find out when I watch the Scooby-Doo movies tonight, I guess.

** I want to participate this month (starting today), but I'm coming without any preparation (which I guess is more or less thematically appropriate). I'm really not sure where to start except "write", and I'm not that good at improvising without some sort of over-arching structure in mind.

--------------

I want to write a Star Wars rational fic. The fanfic would be set in an AU where the Empire and a Mandalorian Protectorate are fighting for dominance over the Galaxy, Cold War-style at first, then overtly, culminating when the Empire completes the Death Star and everyone has to scramble before the Empire wins instantly.

The fic would be focused on the opposing philosophies and perspectives of three factions: the Mandalorians, the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Overall, I think they would respectively be neutral, evil and good, but I probably need more thought on that one. Each faction would have a viewpoint character; I'm thinking Luke for the Rebels (he gets enrolled with a few friends in a rebel cell, and things go out of control from there), and maybe Sabine Wren (from the Star Wars Rebels cartoon) for the Mandalorians; probably Iden Versio as the Imperial character (the Battlefront II protagonist).

Overall, the fic would be rational Star Wars-style space fantasy; with vague technologies and vague logistics, and more of a focus on the characters and ideologies, etc. See also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void][A Voice Across the Void]].

--------------

I'm not sure where to go from there. I know what I want to happen in the end (the Death Star is revealed, and the protagonists set their differences aside to destroy it). I have some vague themes in mind, like:

- Mandalore is a conflicted world. Its leader is a benevolent autocrat, but it has many structural problems; basically, the Queen is Good, but the some of the Dukes aren't. Mandalore fights the Empire for both ideological reasons (cause fuck the Empire) and selfish reasons (the Mandalorians Protectors want to amass more territory).

- The Empire is Evil, but not everyone realizes it. I'm probably going to draw a lot from "A Practical Guide to Evil" for that one (I can probably steal my Empire protagonist and my Darth Vader from there). Ideally, I'd like that message to be delivered in a way more nuanced / interesting that "Holy shit, the Empire is eating babies, I didn't know that!"

- I don't know what angle to take for the Rebellion. "Sometimes they're extremists" feels like it's overdone, and it's not really the theme I'm aiming for, especially since I want them to be fundamentally good. "Some of them are good and some of them are bad" is interesting, but it's already what I want to do with Mandalore.

The things is, all of these are settings idea. I don't really know what I want my characters to do. Some ideas:

- Luke is the one I have the most ideas for. On one hand, I'd like him to have a "War is serious business" arc, where he starts off thinking "Yeah, we're going to stick it to the Empire and be heroes!" Then he faces losses and morally ambiguous choices; at the end, he's considered a hero by the Rebels, but he's become wise/mature enough that he considers his actions as a duty, not an adventure.

- I'd also like him to have some sort of arc where he realizes his force powers by himself. Basically, everything he does is easy for him. He's a fantastic shooter, a good pilot, etc. That leads him to get cocky and get his friends / team / squad into a fight too tough for them. He survives unscathed, they die, and he goes through a "World or Cardboard" arc where he goes to terms with the fact that other people aren't are strong as him, that since he's always assigned on dangerous missions his team has a pretty high turnover rate, that he can't protect everyone, etc.

- I have no idea what to do with Sabine Wren. Ideally, it would showcase her culture and the politics of Mandalore in some way, but I have no idea how to achieve that.

- Iden Versio's arc is pretty straightforward: go from "The Empire is Good" to "The Empire is Bad". Not sure how to do that in practice. Like I said, the standard "the Empire does something very obviously evil and the character has a change of heart" scene isn't what I'm looking for. Ideally, it would be something more progressive, where she goes from "The Empire can do no wrong" to "Okay, that sucks, but we have to do harsh things to keep the peace" to "I really can't abide by this, but the Empire is everything, and I can't turn my back on them" to "How are we better than the Rebels again?" to "Okay, this is not acceptable, I'm done" (probably around the Death Star reveal)

- Ideally, I'd also like that arc to deal with the nature of power, and why the Empire is evil in the first place. I don't want to jump straight to "The Empire does slavery / genocide", I want to show /why/ the Empire does those things; how the Imperial hierarchy works, and why the higher-ups might be inclined / incentivized to do or allow evil things, where they might not be in a different system. The problem, is, I'm not sure I have enough political background to do a satisfying job. Saying "The Emperor only hires evil Admirals" may be shallow, but it's much easier to write than an in-depth exploration of the nature of corruption and cronyism. I probably need some some research, or some source of inspiration.

But the major problem is, I don't know what to write about. Like, I've read the story circle method and stuff, but my most basic question is "What do these people do?" What do I even start with? An action scene? A scene where I show the Rebels recruiting Luke? What scene do I write after that one? Then after that one? etc

--------------

Yeah, that was a lot more stuff than I would have thought. I'd really appreciate any feedback or advice that helps me get started.

** I've got past the first 10,000 words of my '28 years later' novella, and already I'm feeling the benefit of actually planning. If I'd gone into this blind all my characters would still be pottering round their home town, growing food and making ammunition and generally expositing about the beautiful world building I did for them. Well three of them would be doing that, and one probably wouldn't even exist cos I wouldn't have realised I needed him yet. So yeah, onward and upward, and yay for having an actual plot this time :-)
