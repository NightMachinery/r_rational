Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** So right now I want to write a prequel series about Garh Nix's The Seventh Tower series. As there is no fanfiction of it and my yearly rereading of the series is no longer enough for me.

The only issue is that it is a soft magic system. They use things called sunstones to project light and each color doesnt necessarily have a specific strength or weakness like light magic in Brent Week's series.

There's only a few instances where they go into the how of what the magic theyre performing is doing. So how do you build upon a magic system that is described even less than Harry Potter canon did?

*** I haven't read the series, but in general you could:

- Come up with a harder magic system that explains and is compatible with the canon capabilities and worldbuilding. Probably a lot of work, you'd have to catalogue the uses of magic as well as when magic wasn't suitable and assemble some grand unified theory of it.
- Arrange your story to add limitations to the soft magic. Maybe the protagonists only have access to a single colour of sunstone and have to work around that, or magical predators are drawn to use of the magic
- Focus on the users rather than the magic. If two people can use the same ill-defined magic but one has exceptional reflexes and the other is incredibly stealthy, that could help keep their conflicts interesting.
- Look for problems the magic can't solve

**** Yes. Those are all wonderful suggestions that I will most definitely look into.

My greatest fear while creating a hard magic system is making it too like another series, like Lightbringer, in terms of uses.

My original idea was having the frequency of wavelengths affecting what each color was best at. Like having faster wavelengths be "more solid" or slower ones having area of effect.

I also find myself struggling to come up with problems that the magic cannot solve if used in sufficiently clever ways. Most of the ones I think of would be social problems rather than physical ones as the magic during the pre-veil era was far more advanced than what canon deals with.

*** If my memory of the series is correct, sunstones are grown in Aenir like seeds before being brought back. Their size(?) determines their power--that suggests some kind of distribution based on power, likely a normal distribution. Socially this may get a little weird as there would be relatively few ultra-weak stones (given to children/used as lamps) and a big chunk of the population would have sunstones of a similar power. If you're looking for a smoothly functioning society this would still probably be okay, I cant remember whether the high-population servant class is allowed sunstones per lore. If not, this would be perfect: you'd have a big, disenfranchised lower class, a healthy middle class with ready access to standard-power sunstones, and an elite class with stones 3 or more standard deviations from the mean.

However, an exponential distribution could be fun as it would guarantee a huge amount of near-worthless stones only good for generating white light, and quickly diminishing numbers of stones available powerful enough to advance people through the social heirarchy. It would also make the society a lot more hero friendly: one person with a violet-level stone might be able to put out the same energy as 100 or more people wielding mid-tier stones. It would also be super dystopian, as there would be a huge amount of incentive to advance in the ranks using any means possible ( in our world one level of promotion within a company may have a 10-20% pay rise; in this one a single level could square or cube your net "power") and it would also give those in power the means to really clamp down on those beneath them. The ruling elite wouldn't need a standing army or even much of an honor guard since they would be heavy hitters worth a small army themselves.

Personally I'd go the route of the exponential distribution since it basically tailor makes a hero's tale and also allows for serious power progression as the plot advances.

a big premise is that creatures can be taken back from Aenir using binding rituals and then become "shadows" in the world proper. These are sort of a great equalizer in terms of personal power, as there doesn't appear to be any real advantage to a stronger stone when binding a creature. You just survive long enough to finish the incantation, and boom. Powerful servant.

In terms of the actual power mechanics? It seems to just be power output + technique + cleverness, sort of like programming on the fly. People use common forms for common stuff (like the Red Ray of Destruction) but talented people can put their own twist on the weavings or make their own entirely. If you wanted to be very exact you could specify a power output of a red-level stone (idk, say 5W, enough to lift 0.5 kg) And then an orange stone would be 5^{2} = 25W (enough to lift 2.5 kg). So on until you get to a violet-level stone, 7 iterations out (using a gamma of 1.5, these stones would be found at a rate of about 1 in 30000) you would be able to do the work of 5^{7} = 78175 W or 78 kW--according to Google, enough to power nearly 30 homes.

Note that this plays well with the red ray of destruction as even a few joules of power concentrated narrowly enough could project a cutting edge--but someone countering with higher level light or wearing light armor would shrug it off just fine.

Sunstones also need to be recharged, but the oldest, biggest stones seem to be able to maintain a near-indefinite level of power. I'd probably just give an exponential distribution to their capacity as well, say 3 months of maximum output at each level.

As an aside, you'll notice that the wattage seems low compared to light bulbs. That's because incandescent bulbs are super inefficient--LEDs are able to use a fraction of the wattage to make the same light. A perfectly efficient stone would only require 1/683 W to put out 1 lumen--stones as small as half a watt can reasonably act as light bulbs. Heating would obviously require bigger or more numerous stones.

**** Hmm. I do like this idea quite a bit. I don't have any background in statistics but I THINK I get what you said.

Sunstone are actually charged in nets on the towers above The Veil. Which is a giant veil cast across the sky of the world to block out the sun. This was to weaken the power of spiritshadows in our world.

I believe Sunstone are grown from sunseeds taken from either Aenir or somehow naturally forming in the world. It was never properly explained.

I want the focus of my story to be on pre-veil times and the struggle to combat Spiritshadows when they were at their most powerful. How the ice carls and sunstone users of old fought a great war against the shadows and bound them in place and brought about the veil.

I'm pretty sure the stratification of the sunstone users came about after this do to a warping of tradition.

I wanted to make each wavelength of light particularly useful at one specific thing but was afraid that would be too similar to Brent Week's Light ringer series.

Do you know of any good statistic sources so I can look further into this and understand your suggestion better?

***** Honestly wikipedia is great for a good-enough understanding of stats. You can find textbooks online but they tend to be really dense.

Stack exchange is as always wonderful for one-off questions.

** Okay, so Hunter X Hunter. Great story, great magic system, excellent characters; world is all over the place:

- The known world is in the middle of a gigantic lake. This is somehow a secret; also, people have cellphones.
- A Hunter License basically gives you free jurisdiction to do whatever the hell you want with little to no consequences. How is that possible? Is this because the Hunter Organization is just that powerful? But nukes exist and it is established no one can just shrug them off.
- A Hunter License will be given to literally the devil so long as he passes the Hunter Exam.
- Given the points above, why hasn't /every single/ nen user become a hunter?
- Supposedly, millions of people apply to the Hunter Exam every year. Of those millions somewhere between the 100s and the 1000s actually make it to the Exam location. Then, those numbers are systematically cut down until there only a dozen-or-so maybe-winners (often through death). There have been 286 Hunter Exams before the one we see in canon. There are less than 1000 licensed hunters in canon. These numbers raise questions of how many people are dying in these exams and how is it possible to get away with it.
- Supposedly, only once every 3 years someone who is doing the Hunter Exam for the first time passes. A significant number of non-hunter nen users exist; nen basically grantees passing the Exam.
- How does the Heaven's Arena work? How do they get the money to pay the fighters and how come they allow them to live in luxurious houses? Also, the audience has a chance of dying depending on the fight.
- Why isn't the Zoldyck family / Phantom Troupe already dealt with by an organized effort?
- Chimera Ants biology is really /really/ weird.
- Alluka breaks the setting.
- Greed Island also breaks the setting and feels completely disconnected from the rest of the world.
- How do people in Meteor City get so powerful?
- As the leader of a country, even if a small one, Gyro had many, /many/ options to destroy humanity. Also, how come that guy is so popular?
- Kiriko are shape sifting creatures that seemingly can assume the form of anyone they want and they... live in a cabin isolated from everyone.

Given this list that I admittedly might have gone a little overboard with, how do you think one could make the HxH setting more rational. How do you solve the contradictions? What do you change while staying true to the soul of the story? Things not mentioned are welcome too.

*** In no particular order:

Yes, a Nen user would basically autopass the combat portion of the test. The issue is that even finding the damn thing is going to make 95% of even nen users fail out.

Also, while becoming a hunter gives you lots of benefits, it also puts you on a database of the most dangerous people alive, so presumably some nen users simply choose not to become hunters. For a normal person merely becoming a hunter makes them rich and powerful, but for someone with nen all you need to become rich and powerful is the nen itself, and in fact becoming a hunter may even hinder you.

No, people can't shrug off nukes, but as we see in the auction that doesn't mean that hunters can't just kill everyone in your organization/goverment with stealth and nen-powers. So all it takes is one really strong hunter (or a bunch of more moderate ones), and they can just overthrow your government if they want. The hunters organization has 1000 superhumans including likely a dozen on the level that a single one of them would be equal in strength of the spiders all together. In that context the hunters organization being able to do what they want is much more reasonable. Like sure, you can nuke the hunter headquarters.... but then the rest of the hunters get together and murder you and your goverment.

Plus, the idea of cataloging and broadcasting the fact that these are people you really don't want to screw with casually seems like something governments would be totally on board with, if just to avoid accidently provoking them.

Presumably Heaven's arena gets money via people betting on the events, although the economics of how it makes any kind of sense to give people huge amounts of money for just winning a dozen fights in a row where superhumans exist that can win trivially is never really explained.

Alluka does break the setting, its intended. Although from what we know the human world is just a small portion of the real world, so its entirely possible that she doesn't break the setting at all, just the tiny weak human part of it.

Greed island is super odd yeah, and it is totally disconnected from the rest of the setting. I hesitate to say that it does break the setting though specifically /because/ it can't interact with the rest of the world. I suspect that the nen powers used to make it are useless in the rest of the world and only work there via intense self restrictions on the nen used by master hunters.

Looking at the Kiriko as living in the woods isolated from humanity is one way to look at them, but the other way is seeing them as highly skilled people working for the most powerful organization on the planet.

EDIT: I won't even pretend that I think the world itself is a very rational one though.

**** I mean, yeah. There are reasons one can give to the points above that can explain their inclusion in the story. I find it, however, that, when you put them together it seems like a very /very/ odd fit of things that push SoD. So, I'm trying to think of ways one could try making the setting more rational, there are, however issues with changes you try to make.

For instance, what if the Dark Continent didn't exist, and instead Chimera Ants were aliens? As Dragonball-esque as it would be, it would also give you some wiggle room to justify chimera ants biology (thought you'd still have to do something about their remembering past life bit), and if Dark Continent exploration is Space Exploration, then you don't have to justify somehow the Dark Continent not being a well-established known fact thorough all of the known world. On the other hand though, well, how does one fit the Whale-boat arc into a spaceship? That seems quite difficult. And since you mention Alluka; we know Nanika comes from DC through WoG, how would you justify it if DC was in space? Also, Chimera Ants exist in the known world it's just that DC ones are bigger, you also need to deal with that.

The example above lays out a change that justify quite a bit of things, but also creates quite a few problems that need solving. Lets see now another change one could make: Tonpa. Instead of the Rookie Crusher, Tonpa is the Rookie Helper. This is not out of the kindness of his heart, though he pretends it is. Instead, he's just being smart. He's been in the last 35 Hunter Exams, that means almost every single Hunter in the last 30ish years has received his help, meaning he is a friendly acquaintance of some of the most powerful and dangerous people in the world.

This is more the sort of thing I'm looking for. Small changes one can make to canon that make it more rational (well, in this case it makes /Tonpa/ more rational rather than HxH more rational, but you know what I mean) without destroying the spirit of canon.

** Everyone in the world has a "ball", a little orb of matter approximately 30 centimeters across (volume of 14 liters) that floats around within maybe a foot of you. In its natural state, it's somewhat insubstantial, but with a little bit of focus and time, you can shape it. Once the ball has been shaped, it's roughly as dense and heavy as wood, though less easy to damage: damage can be repaired with a reshaping. Once a person has created a shape, becomes easier for them to recreate that shape. Shapes must be contiguous objects. Matter that's not used in the shape will quietly disappear until the shape has been unmade and/or changed.

Thinking through the implications of this:

- Everyone has a tool at hand for whatever they need, without having to carry anything. This means that whole swaths of economies cannot form because they are obsoleted by the ball. It also lowers the capital costs for a wide variety of things where shapes can replace tools.
- Everyone is always armed, or could be armed with only a few seconds notice. (The exact limits on shapes are something that I'm still working out: I would rather not have guns, but would be fine with something more clever than guns that fills the same role. For a projectile-based weapon, you would have to carry the projectile(s) with you.)
- Clothes can, in some circumstances, be partially obsoleted by the ball. Particularly, an umbrella to keep off the sun or rain is always handy, and in a pinch, depending on some specifics of the power (how easy it is to make bendy things, for a start) maybe actual protective clothes of some kind. Cruder armor would definitely be possible, with the easiest being a cuirass that you bind to yourself with a length of string/fabric/rope.
- The shapes can replace a lot of tools and other things that you would take with you as you go, but the options get a lot bigger if you have the ability to augment your shapes, with (for example) a stick, a piece of leather, a wrap, or something like that. If projectile weapons, then this includes projectiles. This allows you to have more complicated tools than you otherwise could, and allows tools to be better (by for example protecting your hand with a grip).
- In addition to common shape augments, you could carry around secondary pieces that slot into a shape, in order to make tools with moving parts, or to otherwise get around problems with the "one contiguous part" rule. Beyond that, two people working together can make two shapes that go together.

I think this is all good and interesting, and needs a bit more thought to figure out what daily life looks like for people in this world, what norms and mores would develop around the balls and their shapes, etc.

Some open questions I still have:

- Saying that it's like wood when in shape form is ... fine, but there are questions about tension, deformation, etc. that probably need to be hammered out. Could you make a bow, if you had a string for it? ... probably?
- What are the most useful shapes that a person could/would make? A knife, hammer, crowbar, staff, bowl, basket, and spear are all at the top of my life at the moment, but those are the primordials, the ones that you start out with as hunter-gatherers, rather than the stuff you would have in an advanced society.
