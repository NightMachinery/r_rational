Hi! I would like to add a Time Turner and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2y56qg/precisely_bound_demons_and_their_behavior/][Precisely Bound Demons]] spells to my DnD game, so I'm trying to clarify their descriptions to make sure they are not overpowered, and lead to fun creative gameplay ideas and implications, without breaking the game. Can you help me out?

*Summon Evil Twin*

You create a copy of yourself with the identical skills and powers, but the polar opposite personality/goals/values. It must obey your direct commands word for word, but will do it's best to foil your plans. You can give it one command per turn(or specify it during the summoning). The evil twin is played by the DM.

*Spell of Time-Turning*

You send yourself and everything you're wearing/holding (everything within a certain radius?) exactly one hour back in time. To avoid paradoxes, the universe has only one stable self-consistent self-correcting timeline - everything that players have already observed is "set in stone" and will happen exactly as it did, but you can influence anything that happened off-screen.

For example if you get ambushed, you can't go back in time and warn yourself about the upcoming danger(because you didn't meet your future self before the ambush), but you can send for help or set up traps for the enemies.

Do these spells make sense? Are they overpowered? How can I improve them to make sure they lead to fun and challenging gameplay and a lot of awesome creative ideas? How would you use/exploit/munchkin them?

Edit: I wanted to add one more spell:

*Open Portal*

Works exactly like portal gun from the portal game. You open two 10-feet wide portals on any surface within 120 feet you have a line of signt to.


** /Summon Evil Twin/ will grind your game to a halt unless your players are very supportive about Rule 0. You (and your players) be trying to adjudicate (and argue about) wish-like clever phrasing *every turn while in combat*.

​

/Spell of Time-Turning/ is a 9th level spell, most likely. It sounds like a lot of fun, but I would have in mind a reason for it to be temporary, since "I teleport home and bring everyone I know to the fight" is a pretty funky mechanic. Meanwhile, it is non-paradoxical for a player to announce , "I arrive from an hour in the future and tell myself everything that happens in this dungeon," as long as in an hour they remember to do so. But Divination spells are already broken so maybe it's fine?

​

/Open Portal/ is pretty great. 5th level probably? You've got two sessions before someone reroutes a river into a dungeon or castle -- the solution to this is elevation changes within the dungeon to stop water flow.

*** What this guy said.

Summon evil twin with precise wording will make players waste a lot of time. Also it is overpowered, you are giving yourself double action for the whole fight. Not so bad if you are playing 3.5 where high level fights are bullshit and losing one full action (not one turn cause only n00bs have one full action a turn in 3.5 high levels) could make sense.

/Spell of Time-Turning/ Players will create pardoxes. They will try to make them no matter what even just to see how the DM reacts.

Open Portal. I would say it is fine, but be prepared with dungeons and castles being destroyed by it (Players do not even need to be original, just rip Portal 2 ending: portal to the moon)

*** Honestly I'd allow /Open Portal/ as a reskin of /Dimension Door/, if you add some caveats. I'd put in that one portal must be on a surface within five feet of yourself, and it can only transmit a total of 2x your carry weight before the portal collapses.

It's got a bit more tactical utility than DD (you can pull someone out of danger from range, or get rid of a monster that's right next to you), but a bit less strategic utility (you can no longer teleport blind).

And they are alive and have a suitable spell slot to cast it. I suggest to address the possibility of them failing to do so with something like "this creates a paradox that then opens up a rift between planes and some time demon or something comes out". So your punishment for getting it wrong is a straightforward "fight this horrible monster" rather than "let's reset the whole last hour of play".

** *Summon Evil Twin:*

This is really vulnerable to munchkinry, and it's not hard to get around the downsides.

Is the evil twin affected by copies of all the spells affecting you? Depending on how the targeting works you could cast Dominate Person on yourself beforehand or use a similar effect to force yourself, and by extension your evil twin, not to be evil.

Does the evil twin appear with equipment? If so, they can use consumable items recklessly and cast spells with expensive material components for you at no cost. If they appear without equipment, that's a lot more bookkeeping and it removes the ambiguity of which one is the twin.

The evil twin can be given suicidal orders, which means you can use them to activate abilities and cast spells that would be too costly to you to use otherwise. For example, in 5e an evocation wizard could have their twin cast spells and use overchannel every turn at no cost to themselves, and an evil twin's castings of wish, while dangerous, might not come at the cost of using up the original's three wishes.

Also, what happens to the evil twin of someone like a Cleric, Paladin, or Druid, whose abilities are at least partly tied to their beliefs and morality?

I'd make this spell similar to Simulacrum, so give it a permanent duration and have the twin appear without any spells prepared for the day, ongoing spells on them, or any equipment. That cuts down on some of the most obvious tricks. Giving the caster and twin a negative level each might also help the balance.

Alternatively, if you want Precisely Bound Demons, why not just include some literal demons that have been precisely bound, and let the players find the item used to issue commands? That way you get around a lot of problems, in particular the issue of players disputing how the evil version of their character would respond to their character's orders.

*Spell of time turning:*

Wish can change the outcome of a single roll that happened last round. Time stop, the closest time magic I can think of, has a duration of rounds. Compared to these, I think making this 9th level and going back 1 minute, rather than 1 hour, would be of similar power.

Also, the restriction on stable time loops could be easy to get around with spells like Modify Memory and illusions, if you just need to convince your past selves that what they saw was real.

*Open Portal:*

D&D is not a good physics engine. I'd suggest instead describing existing spells and effects in terms of how they work with portals. Feather fall? Produce a portal below them that's linked to ground level as soon as they start falling. Reverse gravity? You're juggling people with portals so they're constantly falling. Telekinesis? You're using portals to produce the same effects. Classes that already use a lot of teleportation effects would be a good starting point.

***** I'm not familiar with summoning in D&D, but wouldn't that make the "Good Twin" disappear?

Also, if the evil twin is actually the opposite* of you, then in some ways they might be a better person than you - it is only if you are perfectly good, that they are perfectly evil. Additionally, while good people might not want their evil counterparts running around (and I'm a tad suspicious of the idea that everyone knows whether they're good or evil), evil people might have something to gain by having good counterparts running around - it might make it more likely that people trust you. Additionally, if your duplicate has duplicate money, then we might have a scenario where people who are good are sometimes caught robbing their identical twins, while evil people are caught giving their money away, or to good causes - and reminding bystanders that they are a terrible person who cannot be trusted. Stories like Jekyll and Hyde pop up, but with a twist - sometimes both of them have been spotted in the same place, at the same time. People become suspicious of twins who are the same sex, especially identical twins...

** You should probably specify what happens in-world if players using the Time Turner spell try to do something that creates a paradox, either wilfully or by accident. Suppose they try to go back and warn themselves anyway: are they prevented from moving close enough to their past selves by an intangible barrier? Do they just find themselves unable to maintain the will to keep walking in the direction of their past selves, and compelled to walk away as their past selves approach? Or does fate intervene in a way that seems like an accident?

**** Also, it's worth bearing in mind that Time Turner presumably doesn't let you move in space... so if going back an hour to where you are now would cause a paradox, casting the spell fails.

Say the PCs are infiltrating a castle and stumble into a guardroom, alerting lots of elite guards and getting into a fight they can't handle. If they cast Time Turner right there, they'd go back in time and appear in the guardroom - but if that had happened, all the guards would already have been on alert an hour later and they'd never have been able to sneak in.

So this gives the DM a right to veto using the spell if it would cause an instant paradox.

But smart PCs can use this another way: observe the unalerted castle, go back in time and sneak in, and they can't fail any sneak rolls, because otherwise they wouldn't have seen all the guards snoozing an hour later. So maybe it's too easy to abuse.

** The simplest way to handle time travel is the save/load version. When you go back in time, everything that happened within the last hour is undone except your memories, your mind/soul return to your body wherever it was one hour ago, there is no second copy of you, history begins recording from where you left off and does not have to do the same thing as it did the last time, you do not have to travel back in time a second time at the end of an hour.

This is not how Harry Potter time turners work, but is much more sane and consistent.

Note that if you do it this way you will want to have just their minds travel back (and maybe health/spells/experience) but prevent them from duplicating items.

Summon evil twin seems overpowered if you can just summon it in combat and give it one command per turn, as you can just literally specify which target it attacks and which skill it uses on it. I would suggest having this be a more long-term thing where you have to give it vague directions that can lead it for multiple turns. Maybe you have to give it all of its commands in advance as soon as you summon it, like "kill all of my enemies", which then is vulnerable to the DM misinterpreting what an "enemy is", so to be safer you might say "kill every goblin near me" if you're in a combat where the enemies are only goblins, which backfires if there are friendly goblins, or you want to take prisoners, or a boss that isn't a goblin shows up.

So either you can only give it commands at the beginning of the summon, or once every so long, A more extreme version is if you're making the evil twin be part of an artifact, you could have the evil twin be a permanent member of the party that is always following them. Maybe it has a list of commands that it's following, so you need to have them be general enough to govern its everyday behavior, but you can only add, remove, and modify commands at sunrise or whenever you get new spells. This way, if players make a mistake and the evil twin is exploiting a loophole players have to restrain it rather than being able to instantly modify the command to stop it. This also prevents the players from spending several minutes out of game arguing about the perfect command in a round of combat that's supposedly 6 seconds. Players only give commands during a long rest period, when it makes sense for the character to have a long time to think of something.

In any case, I would suggest both of these to be a legendary artifacts that cast that spell, rather than something any caster can learn. They're kind of really powerful if used right, and so you want to control how many times the players can cast them, and explain why the bad guys aren't using them to do the same things. A world in which any sufficiently strong caster can time travel would have soooooo many differences. Every sufficiently rich and powerful person or group, especially kings and millitaries, would have as many casters who could use this spell as possible, and you would need to figure out how to handle bad guys anticipating your heroe's every move (especially since you yourself can't time travel). A legendary artifact shuts all of that down and gives an excuse for only the players to have this power.

So your plan is for your second self to, let's say, rescue the side character from the horrible death that happened the first time around, but modify your first self's memories so that s/he still /believes/ it happened. And your argument will be that the illusion is really what happened all along.

OK, I think the DM would probably allow that, if you can make the illusion sufficiently thorough and convincing, accounting for absolutely everything that the party went through before you time-turned.

** For Time Turning: the spell fails if it leaves evidence that time travel happened.

The player has to make the altered timeline look like "just ordinary good luck," or the spell fails.

That is, "the spell fails without effect, unless the altered timeline looks to all current and subsequent intelligent observers like something that happened without time travel, and with no more than an ordinary level of coincidence or strangeness."

So it's on the player, not the DM, to avoid paradox. What's more, it's on the player to basically justify everything they set up in the altered past as something that could have happened without time travel anyway. And the more the opponents might suspect this spell, or just employ divination/detection in general, the less the player can get away with.

Thus the caster has to be very sneaky in the past, and make sure that everything that does happen... is something that could have, well, "just happened."

So it becomes retroactive luck, instead of something that lets you make the impossible happen. Because if anyone in the future is going to think "that makes no sense! it's too coincidental, too weird! how could that happen?" -- then the spell fails in the first place.

** Have the Evil Twin cast Summon Evil Twin. You now have a copy of yourself with the identical skills and powers, but the opposite personality/goals/values to your polar opposite. So the Evil^{2} Twin is just a regular clone.

** I think that a spell that turns back time already exists in one of the supplements. IIRC it turns back time one round and the slot stays spent. It's a 9th level Divination and the flavor is that you didn't really go back in time but predicted the future.

** I'm interpreting these as 3.5 rules. (use [[http://d20srd.org]] )

Open Portal is simply Teleportation Circle, a 9th level spell, with less range. Spell of Time Turning is simply overpowered. There's an Epic spell, Time Duplicate, that allows you to get a copy of yourself for one round. Does Evil Twin create matching magic items? It's comparable to Clone, an 8th level spell.

** The time turner spell runs into the issue that you can't actually see the future.

E.g. say the caster says "in 1 day I'm going to come back and tell myself everything that happens tomorrow so I can prepare". What do you do? You don't actually know what will happen over the course of the session, that's half the fun of role-playing. So you have to:

- Tell them your best prediction, then railroad them through it. (Boring.)

- Nothing happens, then you prevent them from casting it somehow. (Implausible that this always happens.)

- Lie, then railroad them into lying (worst of both worlds.)

None of these options is particularly fun, especially if it keeps happening.

Here's one way to simplify: play as normal, with no time travel apparent. Then when they cast, say that they can do whatever they like in the past, but if they do anything that would be apparent to their past selves then the spell ends and they return to the future.

** The time travel one is inherently game breaking because of all the opportunities for abuse it opens. Like let's say the party does the chronotrigger thing of clearing a dungeon, going back in time to do it again, and repeat 3 more times. Or they do it to a merchant's house. The timeline has to repeatedly self correct and drop a bunch of money and artifacts in his lap so that he has the stuff they end up stealing and the party's wealth by level goes out the window. They don't even have to spend it in the present so whatever tracking spells on the loot there are won't matter. You end up having to change the rules on the fly to keep any sense of balance at all and it creates a frustrating experience for everyone involved.

You could do the chronotrigger thing of only allowing jumps to certain eras but it's pretty likely to still cause frustration if the players realize they can get an easy win against the big bad by finding out where the big bad has been, setting an ambush, and casting a spell to let them track him on a piece of his gear, hiding a scrying target on his person or something he takes with him as he escapes their future encounter, and use that to get him after the timeline fixes itself, but then they find out the only thing stopping them is a bit of gm railroading.

** Travel back 1 hour Portal gun 120 feet away, rinse, repeat for on hour / whenever your time turner refreshes

Distances are no longer an issue for you, except for burning lifespan.

Depending on the specific rules around Time, by temporarily placing your portal gun offscreen an hour beforehand, you might be able to use this to temporarily have two or more portal guns, so depending on whether 120 is a limit of the portals or of your firing range, you can have someone else (maybe evil twin, if you feel bold) burn the lifespan instead of you.

I /think/ someone needs to burn lifespan no matter what though.

Also, you /can/ meet your future self, if you precommit to meeting your past self, but you'll need to be supernaturally good at mimicking any of the interactions you saw. Your players may get into endless precommitment issues unless you make precommitment schemes fall under Messing with Time. (since as a dm, you'll have to role play what they do in the parallel time-line, and that's complicated if it has any impact at all on the running time-line.)
