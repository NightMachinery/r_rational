Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

** A question about the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch_mosque_shootings][Christchurch mosque shootings]] in New Zealand. My understanding of their justice system is limited.

 

Having just shot around 100 people in front of countless more witnesses, this guy was arrested on his way to a third mosque, driving a car full of guns covered in holy war scribbles, after posting a terrorist manifesto to twitter and various politicians and media outlets, and /livestreaming the first shooting on facebook/.

He's declared mentally fit to stand trial, and charged with 51 murders, 40 attempted murders, and engaging in a terrorist act. And /he pleads not guilty/.

 

Now, I understand the strategy in a normal case. You have much to gain and little to lose, might as well give it a try. Maybe there isn't in fact quite enough evidence to convict beyond reasonable doubt (or whatever the local standard is), maybe there was a legal fuckup during evidence collection that makes it ineligible, maybe the prosecutor is throwing everything at the wall and you expect some things not to stick.

But. This is like /the/ open-and-shut case that prosecutors dream about. There is no room for reasonable doubt, unreasonable doubt, or drunk shit-stirring troll doubt. At best maybe some of the 40 attempted murder charges might get thrown out, I don't know how they were picked - but this guy is getting life in prison whether or not he intended to spare the Christian janitor or whatever. AFAICT the only thing that a not-guilty plea gets him is a long, exhausting, often boring, emotionally charged trial with a foregone conclusion.

 

So why did he plead not guilty?

I couldn't find any explanation in media reporting. A few months ago, the killer actually changed his plea to guilty on all charges (including all the attempted murders), but the reaction of the press and involved people was surprise and puzzlement rather than "well, duh."

If you can't understand someone's actions, you are using the wrong frame.

I'm making an assumption here, but it really seems like you are thinking about with a "criminal who is trying to get away with crime" sort of frame.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What if that's the goal? This is someone who has been very clear on his motivations. He knows the media coverage someone like him would get. There are plenty of possibilities/reasons for a terrorist to put a not-guilty plea.

- Lack of guilt. He believes his victims deserve it/his actions were just.
- Call for action/Call for awareness. Similar to above, seeking to affirm similar beliefs or to make others aware of his "righteous" cause.
- Deny authority. He doesn't believe the government has the authority to judge him, or he denies the justness of their laws.
- Anger the victim's families. As you said, this is an open and shut case. It is basically guaranteed he will be going to prison for the rest of his life. Why not drag out the period before prison and cause as much suffering to those he hates?
- Waste everyone's time. Same thing as above.

#+begin_quote
  but the reaction of the press and involved people was surprise and puzzlement
#+end_quote

This is because they were surprised by his not guilty plea initially. They realized he must have had some angle he was working.

Then suddenly, he changes his plea without a reason. It could be a sudden change of heart, but it is more likely he found a better angle. After he fired his lawyers and chose to represent himself, it seems they suspected he was trying for a call for action/awareness and are taking steps to mitigate it.

*** A guilty plea can be seen as an admission to the prosecutor's version of events, so pleading not guilty may be to dispute particular claims, rather than claiming innocence.

Alternatively, it may be to get media attention or cause more suffering for the victims.

** Under the category: "Tropes I'd like to see go away" I'm going to add:

Poor / No documentation for the LitRPG system you suddenly find yourself thrust into.

Is there a single LitRPG out there that does come with documentation? A starter manual? Online help?

The only exceptions to this are the LitRPGs that are based on D&D or another popular system, and even then it relies on the player MC to already have considerable experience with the system.

1. Most readers only have so much patience for pure unadulterated rules-talk.

2. Most readers want a bit of interesting system stuff every few chapters at least. If you reveal all the mechanics from the start, you've kind of blown your load.

/Worth the Candle/ is my go-to example of litRPG done right (damn near perfectly), and I do not think it would have been improved by front-loading full documentation of all the skills & bonuses.

**** You're right, opening a story with a block of pure rules would be an unwelcome slog. But I think that makes doing so anyway a bit of an interesting writing challenge

Off the top of my head, it might work if there's an existing party and this isn't their first time being isekai'd into a new litRPG. So they already have a systematic approach to learning the rules of their new world, which gives them an excuse to know how to prioritize important info. And it gives the author a wider variety of stuff to introduce - characters, their existing relationships, anecdotes about their previous adventures, their system for understanding RPG systems, and the system itself.

** What is the a good way to self edit a story before reaching out for more public constructive criticism? I'd want to ask for review of my story, where the vague idea behind the story is 'What if Isekai LitRPG, but the main character is controlling multiple summons instead of being an individual.' But after starting at chapter 0, I'm in the middle of chapter 3 and the pacing seems much too off. It's all much too slow. But one of the reasons the pacing is off is because I'm trying to add more details, because I see a lot of complaints about how people do LitRPG and don't actually have any of the details mean anything.

But on the other hand, if you actually have someone start at the very bottom in a stat sense, you have a lot of 'learning how to not die instantly' except since the characters dying are summons, you CAN have them die instantly and continue the main characters meta-learning and the story. So there is some 'And that one was hit by a sneak attack and died, and that one was hit by a sneak attack and died, and that one ate food without leveling up their sense of taste and died, and those 4 DID manage to kill a cannibal who was going for an attack, but 3 of them died.'

Another problem is describing people so low on the stat scale seriously makes a lot of the early conflict being described as between people with stunted growth who are terribly thin and have no armor/barely any weapons of any kind, which feels realistic to their given stats, but off in terms of actual reading.

It also seems similar to another story I wrote years ago, which also had a slow start with a weak character and got a 1 positive to 10 negative review reaction that at the time made me decide to unpublish it. I probably have a somewhat thicker skin now, but I don't want to get a bunch of negative reactions if I can fix some of the problems myself in editing.

*** The main thing that jumps out at me is that there needs to be stakes. If the main character has infinite summons, then there's the risk that he can just chuck summons at the problem until it goes away.

It depends on what vibe you're going for. It could be a desperate scramble to survive and find out the information ASAP. If it's light hearted, you could lean into how pathetic the fights are, and get some comedy out of it.

You need to pace the details out. We don't need to know all of them immediately. Maybe the MC can look at his stats and wonder about things. He can come up with ideas about what's good and what's bad. He experiments and sometimes he's very wrong. Whilst this is happening, plot should happen as well.

The character should be interesting, we should enjoy being in his head whilst all this goes on.

**** You make a great point.

The summoner (separate from the main character controlling her summons) is also very weak and vulnerable at the moment, yet other than her hiding in a ditch and not yet being noticed, hasn't suffered any on screen risk. Some kind of scene where the main character had to control her summons to protect her from death as she summoned more as fast as she could would add a lot more action, and would prevent the hostile cannibals from feeling so dumb or blind as to be incapable of finding someone who has no actual stealth skills.

Also, going after the summoner instead of the infinite summons is a tactic I think I learned from my dad in grade school playing Bard's Tale 2: It's not so advanced at least some of the cannibals shouldn't make the connection and at least try it.

Summed up, I think my problem is that foes on screen haven't been intelligent enough yet, so in retrospect it is no wonder it seemed slow paced. Thank you very much for helping me realize that.

*** On how to edit: It helps to put some days between the writing and a second pass, to get emotional distance from your words and get your brain into a different task loop. Awkward sentences and poorly portrayed thoughts can be improved, and if systematic refactoring looks necessary, it can be done.

On how to write: This is one of those things that should have universally been taught in school but wasn't: the foundation of all widely appealing writing is the tribe. The human brain is designed for social interactions. If your heroine doesn't have opinions and feelings about her minions and they to her, that'd be a lot of gravy left on the table. (There's a reason characters are introduced slowly, and why there only ever seems to be ~12 people that ever exist in the world in fiction.)

A terminally clichéd line of the events you describe for example: Girl gets isekai'd -> discovers she can summon monsters, cool! -> discovers her first monster is a giant rat -> she doesn't like rats and is grossed out by it, tells it to stay far away -> meets some people, asks them for help -> they're silent, but she doesn't run away due to ignorance, and doesn't go on a killing spree because she's not a murder hobo -> one of them stabs her -> rat bites her attacker -> they run away, the scavengers are too weak to keep up -> she still doesn't like rats ---> the rat is now the protagonist!

But anyway, this isn't for profit so you don't have to conform to template. Don't do things because you think other people will like them (even if that person is me), do it because you like them.
