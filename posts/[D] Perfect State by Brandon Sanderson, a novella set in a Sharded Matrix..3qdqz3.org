I found Perfect State a bit ago, and it was wonderful. Sanderson's one of my favorite authors, and this novella felt like a worthy companion to qntm's Ra, Prime Intellect, and the Friendship is optimal universe.

It's mostly a story about an unconventional date between two people who would be on opposite sides of the reality vs. simulation argument, in a simulation system which tries to maximize happiness.

*** I would go in, but I don't think I'd be optimally happy in that sharded an environment.

*** I can totally see humanity using the matrix as a tool, such as for education, entertainment, and therapy. For people who can't function in normal society, giving them a matrix world which lets them fit in seems like a good step forward in providing them with the support many don't get.

At the same time, being locked into a matrix is essentially a horror, especially when coupled with (near)immortality. If I had incontrivertable proof that there was a concious entity intentionally subverting my desire for agency, they'd clearly be an enemy if they had no intention of ever letting me have agency on a level similar to their own. Even if I was convinced they did plan to allow me out eventually, I'd still be pretty adversarial towards them.

Yeah, I've never had a very good relationship with parents or other controlling entities. :P

** Yep, love this. (I posted about it a while back, as [[/u/eaturbrainz]] pointed out.)

I consider it one of his strongest stand alone works. The Emperor's Soul is really solid, too, but less of standard [[/r/rational]] fare.
