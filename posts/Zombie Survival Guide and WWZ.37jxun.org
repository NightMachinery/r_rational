I've heard good things about these books from non-rational readers about how they logically handle a zombie situation.

How rational are these reads before I invest time in reading them?


** World War Z is a fantastic book. It's got a few weak spots as far as rationality goes (places where it's being cool rather than practical) but overall it's pretty good on the "rational" scale. It's an oral history of the zombie war, and is fundamentally about people triumphing through intellect and determination. Many of the failures are logical intellectual failures, and many of the triumphs are intellectual triumphs.

The Zombie Survival Guide is written as a non-fiction book, and basically says "given our premise, these are the consequences", which it does a good job at. Aside from one of the appendices (which contains fictional accounts of interaction with the undead) it doesn't deviate from this non-fiction schtick, but it worked for me. Highly rational, in that it's an application of actual thought to the problem of zombies.

I've got to disagree with you there. This is how the book advertises itself, but when I was reading it, I was surprised by how little of this there actually was. Quite a lot of the book was spent discussing international politics during the "conflict", and it's an incredibly weak point, in my opinion. As an example, Pakistan and India nuke each other in the books, and the best explanation given was that their leadership was just incompetent. Israel opens its borders to outsiders, which is not just odd, but rather awkward to anyone who knows about Israel's recent dealings with the Sudanese. Even worse is everything to do with China. It's hinted at that China invented the virus in the first place, and tried to cover it up. It's also revealed that China wanted to institute Kessler Syndrome for really poorly thought out reasons. China, one of the most powerful countries with some of the smartest people in the world working for them, basically becomes a James Bond-esque villain.

Plus there's the whole celebrity-zombie-house reality TV show chapter, which was one of the most inane, dumbest, and hardest to get through pieces of text I've ever read, bar none, fan-fiction included.

The best parts of the book are the parts which are proper "oral histories". Early in the book, there is a section where an Indian man talks about his experience escaping off the shores of India onto boats. He describes the turmoil and catastrophe that resulted in the crowding of the beaches, and the scrambling to get into the water, while zombies were all around. It was done rather well, and I still remember it as some of the most impactful imagery I've read. However, the book doesn't stay faithful to this throughout, as I've already stated.

Even the good parts aren't really "rational", in the sense used here. I don't recall any parts where characters actually solve problems with clever incite, in such a way that the reader may have thought of it as well. WWZ doesn't treat zombies/zombie survival more or less rationally than any other portrayal I've seen. I will say that the book makes frequent blatant factual errors, as the author didn't actually strive for real-world accuracy when writing. For instance, one of the very first things in the book is a doctor character repeating the misnomer that dogs have cleaner mouths than humans.

I don't think "misnomer" means what you think it means.

***** Okay, but you knew what I meant. "Factoid", if you prefer.
