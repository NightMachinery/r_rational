Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

How do you make invisibility scale across a superhero story?

I was hit by a random BNHA fic urge the other day and was wondering how Hagakure gets by when you have a bunch of powerhouses (shoot explosions from your hands, control of both fire and ice, enough physical strength to arm wrestle the Hulk with ease). For those who don't know, Hagakure's quirk (inherent superpower) is that she is completely invisible, but only her body and not any accessories. So she can't be seen by the naked eye whilst she doesn't wear anything. Later on she works out how to fiddle with light to pseudo-flashbang folks on demand, but she's basically a background character in the story so she doesn't get any discussion of her quirk on screen.

It seems like there are a lot of weaknesses to her quirk in any story with significant superpower proliferation. Sensory powers ignore invisibility, area of effect powers can inadvertently harm her, there's enough already existing forms of technological detection to both counter infiltration attempts, or just slap onto another person as is (give a disposable grunt heat vision goggles and a gun and you're reasonably protected).

There are ways to make a superpower that also grants invisibility strong: make it force everyone who detects you to ignore you instead (so it effects sensory powers too), make it easy to expand to cover other people and objects instead (an invisible army or an invisible sniper outside the range of other forms of detection), package it with any number of other powers and have the user only very rarely bring it out as a surprise trump card. But I'm not sure how you make baseline "my body is invisible" powerful unless your entire shtick is listening on low-level disposable guys meeting in alleyways and little else, or you spend your entire time as an unregistered vigilante who moves between locations frequently so no one ever expects you in the first place (and then a sufficiently high budget doorlock can still prevent you going after many a target).

*** Yeah its interesting I don't know of any really powerful invisibility based super heroes. But I think it could definitely be done.

The type of invisibility might matter, and certain ones seem more powerful.

First I'd separate invisibility powers by how they work:

1. *Benders*: light is bending around them. Might have gravity power implications.
2. *Pass-throughs*: Light waves just passing right through them. Could have implications for ignoring certain kinds of energy waves.
3. *Illusionists*: there is an illusion of empty space, they are actively creating light. This has implications for altering appearances are creating different kinds of illusions.
4. *Mind ghosts*: they are there but they just reach out to erase their presence from other people's minds. Cameras might easily identify them afterwards, but they can walk right past the security guards.

Next it matters what spectrum of energy they are impacting. This is probably a bit of a sliding scale. At the low end of invisibility powers would be just impacting the energy spectrum visible to a regular human eye. Any creatures or devices that peek into infrared or ultraviolet would still be able to see them. At the high end of the power ability would be controlling any part of the energy spectrum.

Finally there is what degree of control they have over their powers. If they are just flicking a mental switch to 'be invisible' then there obviously isn't much room for growth. If they have to exert some level of control over their powers then it can get very interesting.

Consider an illusionist that can alter all ranges of the energy spectrum. They could grow to the level of shooting beams of gamma rays out from their body. Or possibly extreme levels of infrared and cook their enemies.

A bender could learn to create extreme bends in light waves and maybe create a magnifying glass. They also might be a counter to an illusionist shooting gamma death rays. Depending on what is giving them their bending they might be able to extend their bending abilities to matter. Bend bullets around them.

A pass through could have some of the weirdest extended powers. What allows the normal laws of physics to just pass through them? What other laws of physics can they ignore? Are they partially phasing out of this dimension? They might actually be incredibly difficult to kill. Imagine someone that /only/ allows light in the visible spectrum to impact them, and only on their retinas. All matter, radiation, etc doesn't touch them unless they want it to. You'd have a pair of eyeballs drifting around and entering any area or facility that they want to.

The mind ghosts could expand their powers into altering people's minds in other ways. But I feel mind altering powers have been pretty well explored.

**** In addition to what everyone else has said, she might have a really good sensory power. After all, for her eyes to work normaly not only would the retinas need to interact with light, but the entire eyeball has to refract it so it forms an image and block it from all other angles to prevent a white-out, and that clearly isn't happening. So if it's just interacting with the retina, there's no reason she couldn't just look the other direction out of the back of her head, and form there you quickly get 360 degree vision, being able to zoom in like a telescope, expanding the frequency and number of colours she can see, etc.

Another thing you could probably get away with is asking WHY it seem she only blocks the human visible spectrum. It seems like it might be BECAUSE that's what people use to see her via some sort of psychological mechanism, and that if she /practiced/ being watched by an IR camera and trying to hide from it she'd eventually learn to be invisible to IR as well, and so on with the entire EM spectrum.

She'd also probably be immune to EM based weaponry like lasers, radiation, etc. and maybe even many sources of dangerous heat in general letting her walk into burning buildings and stuff depending on what exactly counts as a very short range IR interaction.

*** If Hagakure really is a light manipulator (as the light flashbang thing suggests, I had really forgotten all about that), then it's very arbitrary that she'd be limited to only manipulate light around herself for the sake of being invisible. First, she should be able to turn visible (which I guess would do wonders for her social life). Second, she could develop her Quirk in ways that allow her to distort, curve and focus or unfocus light or even electromagnetic radiation as a whole in a certain radius around her body. If she can do that, it becomes a lot more powerful of an ability.

**** I only knew the flashbang thing because I checked the wiki in case I was forgetting something when writing up this post :S

The canon explanation was along the lines of messing with light "inside" her body (occupying the space her body would normally be visible in?) and reflecting it or refracting it or something. I don't know if she could actually become visible beyond appearing as a solid pitch black figure, given her stuff seems to be innate/instinctual and there's never been a scene of Aizawa innadvertantly cancelling her quirk and a naked girl popping up or something (although given the author made Mineta exist in canon I'm surprised the author hasn't done that scene too, blergh), and I guess he can't cancel quirks from people innately born a certain way in canon like Spinner and others. Although since Aizawa's quirk is based on sight, making herself partially visible somehow (with a generous definition of visible, like said pitch black appearance) might let his quirk cancel out the rest of her own from there?

But yeah, totally agree that light manipulation is totally on the cards, or would be if she got screentime (pun not intended). You could probably make that stuff really interesting if you started taking inspiration from the actual physics of light, although there could easily be a lot of weird implications from anything you came up with (I feel like you could step on the toes of something to do with the speed of light and stuff gets funky quickly). And also I guess putting Hagakure on screen with anything more powerful than her baseline introductory quirk opens up discussions about the way physics is understood in universe more than other characters, since it seems like she could boost her quirk with actual study of scientific knowledge rather than just practice, trial and error, or shounen-style believing in yourself harder like everyone else gets to do.

***** Anything like "her body is a perfectly ideal non-dissipative material whose diffraction index she can manipulate at will across position and the EM spectrum" would be in practice insanely broken. Even more if she could produce non-linear optical effects.

BTW goes nicely with a fanfic idea I have called "Einstein's Child" in which instead it's Ochako Urahara to discover the intrinsic brokenness of her power through the study of general relativity (something that btw is alluded to as a throw-away joke in one of the omake 4-komas).

****** There's a lot of unexplored territory with BNHA that doesn't involve punching people harder. I'm reminded of an old SMBC comic about people working out Superman would save more lives by being a human* generator for cheap energy instead of fighting crime ([[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13]]), and a lot of the 1A quirks would be in a similar boat, or at least able to make stuff a whole lot more efficient with civil engineering training rather than hero training (Todoroki, Uraraka, Midoriya, Yaoyorozu, Kaminari etc.). Also Shoji the organ donor should really be a thing.

Also some of the quirks would be so effective as villains. Imagine Momo turning carbs into bombs, or Ashido doing horrific shit with acid. Hell, a smarter Twice and possibly a careful Shinsou could take down countries by themselves if so inclined.

TBF that's also why the manga killed off Twice after he unlocked his full powers. It was just too much to justify him being still one of the LoV and /not/ instantly one-shotting every battle. Not that the LoV is short on overpowered characters, Shigaraki and Gigantomachia are both human WMDs.

******* I've read that comic too, and while I enjoyed it, it only applies when Superman is fighting normal street criminals. He doesn't just fight common thugs, he fights invading alien fleets, or gargantuan space monsters that devour planets, or literal gods that would enslave earth for all eternity.

I know it's not the point of the comic, but it just bothers me a bit when I know that the result of Superman not fighting crime is eventually that a galaxy-destroying star-conqueror will wander over to Earth and erase it because Superman wasn't there to fight them.

*** Every popular super power has a psychological root regarding why we use it in stories so often. Invisibility is about not being perceived, and all the stuff you could get away with then. So in that spirit you can extend invisibility to being a terrifying anti-meme, SCP style. You could make people's eyes slide away from you, anything you do with you, and concepts relating to you.

Another small mod could be to make it ability to control tangibility (pass through walls, etc). That would be an instantly one hit ko on anyone or anything unless it has organs bigger than a whale.

If you want just baseline naked body invisibility and everyone else can explode planets and you don't want to be in a physics lab for the whole story, then I think it basically comes down to assassinations and spying and mind games. I guess you also have immunity to lasers which you could combine with tech. Mostly it cannot be a direct combat role. It would be down to the intelligence of the character to use it. Try putting it on a character who would be scary even without any powers at all, or putting it on a henchman of such a character. (E.g. lex luther)

** On a DnD munchkinry kick after reading some glowfic set Pathfinder, so have a DnD releated optimization problems...

You are a God of Magic and Travel that has just had one of your Clerics reach Earth after an accident with an interacting Teleport and Plane Shift. You are now looking to expand into Earth. You can give out spells from the [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/clericSpells.htm][Cleric list]] and from the [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/clericDomains.htm#magicDomain][Magic]] and [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/clericDomains.htm#travelDomain][Travel]] Domains... (3.5e). Your Cleric also knows and has a spell book for [[https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spellLists/sorcererWizardSpells.htm#zeroLevelSorcererWizardSpells][Level 0 Wizard Spells]] and could manage to teach them to someone with around 1-3 months dedicated (several hours a day) teaching, but has no idea how to even start on level 1. Unlike the DnDd rules, you have a bit of flexibility, you can give a spell to Cleric that they didn't request based on what you want them to use and/or what you expect them to need. You can give Cleric spells outside your domains as if the spell was around two levels higher. Unfortunately you also have a bunch of constraints...

- by preexisting God-agreements you can only have one Level 1-4 Cleric (with Level 0and Level 1 Spells) per 30 worshipers, one Level 5-8 Cleric (Level 0-4 Spells) per 90 worshipers, one Level 9-14 Cleric (Level 0-7 Spells) per 300 worshipers, and one Level 15 or greater Cleric (Level 0-9 Spells) per 900 worshipers. You can give occasional level 0 and level 1 spells to lay-worshipers, maybe around 1 spell per week to each worshiper. You can communicate a short sentence once each day to a worshiper when they pray.
- This Earth God YHWH also has some hard rules that you can't risk breaking: No spells to interfere with "Free Will". You have to allow prayer by members of Abrahamic faiths with no outstanding unrepresented sin to counteract your followers spells. And you can't interfere in the exceptionally rare event YHWH actually intervenes to perform a miracle (he is apparently really stingy with them, only 1-2 genuine minor miracles each year in the entire world and always away from cameras or recording devices).\\
- Your Clerics must have an urge to Travel and explore magic. Also if they get too tied down to one place (by buying a permanent home for example) and/or stop visiting new places your ability to give them spells fades away. To put some hard numbers on it, going a week or two without seeing an new interesting location/land mark starts causing issues. Going a month causes spells to almost entirely fade away. Living in one location for 6 months starts causing issues but can be compensated with lots of temporary day trips for up to 3 years.
- Finally, things in the world that disrupt travel cause you pain and make it difficult to give spells to Cleric related to them by location. Notably, the restrictions on every national border cause you some issues and most prison systems providing no alternatives to long-term imprisonment (such as exile, beatings, or death). This can come up several ways... For example a Cleric with a sibling who works for ICE would be too painful to grant spells to if they have any kind of contact with that sibling. A cousin in ICE who the Cleric never speaks to would be just barely manageable.

So with these constraints, how do you go about spreading worship in your faith and your ideals of travel and magic?

*** Based on what you say it should spread organically without you needing to do anything, especially among poorer groups. The reason for this is that the level 0 and level 1 priest spells are actually extremely damn helpful and the fact that literally every single worshiper gets one a week is game changing.

It's honestly pretty hard to argue against: "If you worship this god (who objectively exists and responds directly to your prayers) you get as much clean water as /you/ need out of nowhere" or "If just you worship this god your whole family can clean enough dirty water (or food) to survive".

Similarly, the ability to heal wounds that last months or would otherwise be permanent without medical care without even having to leave your house (eg. a broken bone on an older person) would be a categorical change no matter how much money you have. And that's without even getting into the stuff that actual Clerics could get up to which would also be extremely helpful at spreading your faith.

**** Online avenues was my first thought. Like does the travel and discovery stuff get eased at all by virtual sightseeing tours, videoblogs of others travels, or whatever VR can cook up these days? Also just having the cleric do their best to spread the word while someone else drives their bus/caravan around the country/s would also help, unless the deity's requirements specifically require a certain type of personal agency in travel decisions.

Oh also, geoguessr is a thing, does that count for something?

Edit: also, how does the form and speed of travel count? How does a charity walk stack up to a cannonball run? And how does stuff along a vertical axis work? Scuba-diving and those zero-g flight things? Hot-air balloons? Does travel while asleep/unconscious/stuffed in a van with a sack on your head count differently?

**** I really like the idea of a reverse Isekai with a low level wizard. In their world they may only have a handful of 2nd circle spells, which actually put them at the peak of skill in their little village and they don't even use their 2nd circle spells to particularly valuable effect, instead doing stuff like doing laundry with Prestidigitation, but on Earth they would be a big shot. All of the limits in their small village: the cost of paper and ink, the lack of background scientific knowledge, the lack of money and time to research are gone on Earth. High quality paper and ink are cheap, any non-magical knowledge is one internet search away, and people will pay thousands of dollars to see minor spells.

For internet usage... I thought there was some specific process going on with the spell book and focusing on visual pattens that helped the Wizard prepare the spells. If it is strictly a need for high quality images of geometric diagrams, then internet usage works. If the paper/ink itself becomes magical in the process of writing down the spell internet teaching does not work...

** Unmarked spoilers for Holes below.

Are there any clever solutions to finding the buried treasure? For the uninitiated, the treasure is buried somewhere in maybe 100 square miles of Texas desert. Louise Walker's family owns the land, and she spends most of her young life being forced by her grandfather to dig random holes trying to find it. Once he dies and she gains control of the land, she decides to build a juvenile detention facility on the land and get teenage inmates to do the digging instead.

That's creative, but with every hole dug giving you maybe Powerball odds at finding the treasure, is there a better way?

So a causal hobbyist metal detector isn't anywhere near deep enough, but specialized metal detectors can easily beat 6'. The area doesn't seem to have common issues like metallic soil or other objects that would cause issues. The target is a large chest.

Now how long would it actually take to sweep the area? This would take awhile... but I would guess the area covered by a group of boys digging in a week is a smaller than what one person can cover in a day with one of the better [[https://www.okmdetectors.com/products/exp-6000-professional-plus?gclid=CjwKCAiAg8OBBhA8EiwAlKw3krpvOSnnJsRgF08VWc-a3D93y3u5qS2YIm9SAw33k9KZmkYbUxBpohoCPgAQAvD_BwE][metal detectors]]

100 square miles / 5 square feet = 557.6 million searches

[[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100+square+miles+%2F+5+square+feet]]

If you can't use sonar or a good metal detector like the other comments suggested and you have to dig holes.

Then I wouldn't dig large holes, but instead of a bunch of small ones. Use an earth auger.

A gas powered one could probably dig the holes in a minute or two: [[https://youtu.be/PrfJpFQcSj0?t=214]]

The hand powered ones I saw online were also pretty efficient. Maybe 15 minutes for a hole.

15 minutes a hole (assuming you want to use child labor, and not give them gas powered tools) and 557.6 million searches means it would take about 139 million man hours to comb the entire desert. But maybe you get lucky and you only need 10 million man hours. With 40 kids working 8 hours a day that is 85 years. With 100 kids its only 35 years. Unless you are cursed with bad luck and unlikely to find the treasure, in which case multiply those years by 13 to search the entire desert.

But if you have that many man hours, do you really have nothing better that they could be doing? If their labor was only worth $1 an hour then the treasure needs to be worth at least $10 million to be worth the search. But a hundred pounds of gold is only worth about $2 million. The bonds would have to be valid to be worth anything, which seems unlikely given their age, you'd need a legal fight to validate them, and if they are bonds for specific companies those companies could be long gone. I'm not sure about the value of the jewels. Its hard to find any good source estimates online. But they would have to be worth more pound for pound than the gold would be to get up in value to that magic $10 million number.

In conclusion, without a good way of doing a cheap and easy search there is no way the treasure chest could justify the labor costs put in to finding it.
