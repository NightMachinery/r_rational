Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow [[/r/rational]] fans...

- Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][tropes]]?

- How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

- Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

- Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

- Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.


** Do you guys tend to write chapters in order?

My usual writing process is this: plan out loose sketch of events in Ch1, repeat for 2-4, sit down to start actually writing ch1, get inspired for ch2 instead and write that whole thing out, then start writing ch1, but halfway through realize that while I can hook up events such that the end of ch1 leads into ch2, it will feel really clunky and like I'm railroading the characters and forcing them to act in a way that doesn't feel like them. ERROR: UNABLE TO LINK CHAPTER 1 TO CHAPTER 2. Uuuhhh... I'll come back to this later. Repeat for chapters 3 & 4, 5 & 6 etc. Should I just get chapters 1&2 to connect and rewrite the end of 1 over and over until it both feels right and goes where I want? Or should I just go "welp, that chapter is doomed" and rewrite chapter 2?

*** Because [[https://heroessavetheworld.wordpress.com][Heroes Save the World]] deals with multiple characters and points of view over the course of a thirteen-chapter sequence, at least some of which aren't directly leading off from other chapters, it's easy for me to get stuck on one chapter and jump ahead to do a few other ones.

This has often led me to feeling secure about my six- or eight-chapter buffer, only to realize with a panic that I may have a lot of chapters written but the one that's coming up Right Freaking Now is still unfinished.

*** I think processes are different for everyone, and if you find that works (more or less) then you should stick with it. I also think in general, if your characters are doing things that surprise you, that's /excellent/ because it means you have a good sense of their voice / personality / etc, which means they're a proper character.

I do find I jump around a bit, but that's mostly because I'm not sure what happens in e.g. chapter 5, but I know what happens in chapter 7. Then I get inspired for chapter 5 and can go back and fill that in.

I think the fact that I've spelled out my entire plot already, including all the major beats, helps. I know what happens in each part of the story and how it happens, so there's no need to worry about the characters doing the wrong thing.

In your specific case, you'll either need to throw chapter 1 out and get a chapter 1 that flows into chapter 2 better, or just edit the heck out of both until they meet. I do know that a lot of the time when my characters get into a deep conversation that is completely pointless to the plot, or gives an impression I don't want the plot to give, I just suck it up and delete it. And either start over, or realise that you don't actually need that scene at all. It really hurts because often those things you put in like that are things you realy like, or little implications you really want to explore, but if they don't help thes tory they have to go.

** (I noticed this wasn't here and had a question so took the liberty of putting it up...)

Question:

A vampire in my story has 5 human servants, one named major character and 4 minor characters who basically have no impact on the plot (basically they're mobile blood storage units).

How do you balance between "all characters need names because they represent people who have you know dignity" and "I don't want to make the reader think they need to keep track of these four characters, when they impact the plot only as a group, and appear in two scenes, with no dialogue"?

It seems clunky and unnecessary to introduce them, you know, "and so she introduced them as Adam and Beatrice and Charlie and Diane, and sent them into the spare bedroom for the rest of the visit". But it seems weird not to give them names.

*** I tend to introduce characters like that by their role. I may have their names recorded on a back document somewhere, but that doesn't mean it's something I'd necessarily mention in the text.

**** Here's how I've handled them. Pretty much in line with your recommendation I'd say...

#+begin_quote
  At the appointed time, an automobile parked out the front of their cottage, and five people walked out; Lucia, two young men, a young lady and someone who could only be Elodia. She was dressed in a fine seafoam ballgown, covered in shimmering jewels. Her attendants wore more modern attire; the gentlemen in suits similar to Red's, and the ladies in gowns that were more practical and less extravagant.

  So he was doing as he was told, and escorted the party to the room that had been organised for them. The attendants, who seemed almost weak from the effort of walking up the stairs, eagerly stripped and climbed into the warm, comfortable beds. Lucia closed the door behind them and gave Red a small smile.
#+end_quote

(the next day, and their "biggest appearance". Janissary basically means a human servant)

#+begin_quote
  The cottage's small kitchen was a hive of activity; a male and female janissary were getting dressed in the most odd clothing Red had ever seen. It was decidedly Victorian - as seemed to be the theme of this whole visit, judging by William and Elodia's clothes today being as old-fashioned as yesterday's, though somewhat less formal. However, this outfit was like nothing any self-respecting dressmaker would let out of his workshop. It was made out of a rich green material embroided with gold, a shapeless tube with long sleeves and pantlegs; the cut identical for both sexes, hiding the natural curves and form of both bodies. The tube extended above the shoulders, moving up to cover the face, stopping just below the eye. Most striking were the two-inch wide oval cutouts in the fabric, heavily outlined with the gold thread, located on the neck, wrists and inner thigh. The outfits had clearly been designed for a different sort of sensibility.

  The two other janissaries sitting by the stove, bandages around their wrists from where they had made their contribution to the ritual. Lucia explained she was keeping the temperature of both the warm and cold blood within a certain range, and how to test it on the inside of the wrist. It seemed like a lot to keep track of, but Lucia handled it with a comfortable smile. It was clear she had done this a great many times before. As Lucia poured her blood into the teacups, Red mentally recited which order they needed to be placed and at which angle to orient the handles when he brought them out.

(later that scene)

#+begin_quote
  As Red was beginning to work up the nerve to run into William's arms despite the potential for further scandal that may bring, Elodia reappeared. Her four janissaries were in tow, the ridiculous green costumes that two of them wore being replaced with more ordinary attire. She stood in front of William, met his gaze, and once again spoke rapidly. William responded in kind and then, with a dramatic turn, she escorted her entourage out of the house.
