-Some guy

So I'm in this writing workshop, and it sucks because everyone sucks at writing and they're not recognizing my genius, but I've noticed this pattern. There are basically two kinds of stories being written:

a) genre stories, primarily by male writers, about people in a crummy situation solving their problems.

b) literary stories, about a 50/50 gender split, that are about depressing, miserable people in depressing, miserable situations who become more depressed and miserable by the end of the story.

c) romance stories, these don't count.

And this pretty much mirrors my experience as a reader. Genre stories heavily feature problem-solving as the appeal, literary stories heavily feature watching things fall to shit as the appeal.

Now, subjective tastes are subjective, but one thing I really value out of stories, and I expect is true for many of you, is characters who can serve as role models. Eliezer has some quote about having learned morality from Thundercats, I don't remember where.

It's true for me as well. My morality, intellectual skills, and heroic qualities, such as they are, are heavily drawn from books I read. I did decent things as a kid in large part because the cool characters in my books did decent things. I learned how to think because detective, science fiction, and some fantasy writers taught me how. Pretty much every brave thing I've ever done was inspired in part by the knowledge that it's what my favorite book characters would have done. At least, my favorite genre book characters.

I read a lot of literary stuff too. It just doesn't really inspire me the same way. Shakespeare is the shit as a writer, but it's not like I really want to model myself after Hamlet. Stuff like /Huckleberry Finn/ taught me powerful lessons, but "be like Huck" was never quite something I thought about.

And not all genre fiction teaches, at least not through role models. /Sandman/ is cool as balls, but Dream is kind of a dumbass. (He's meant to be.)

It's not like genre stories can't tell us things about society and racism and whatever. So I don't see why literary fiction shouldn't be able to give us some people striving to solve their problems and succeeding in doing so instead of getting American Dreamed Into Drug-Addled Misery like 95% of them.

Why would this split exist? +Well, it's pretty clear that in the ancestral environment, men who could impress the tribe with an oral tale of wizards and dragons would get laid all the time+

Maybe there is a lot of literary fiction with characters you can model yourself after and I'm just a fraud who's never read anything. Got any examples? Give them in the comments below and i'll pm u a pizza roll

If there are no examples, wtf is up with literary fiction? Why can't you write a story about a middle class guy who gets a hobby and reinvigorates his sex life instead of sinking into the morass of 20th century suburban ennui?

I don't know why this split would exist. Maybe it's because, when you're writing about a problem in our society that exists, you can't write a story about the average person in that situation who then succeeds in getting out of it, because the average person doesn't succeed in getting out of it. Whereas sci-fi and fantasy allow you to imagine a fictional world where just a normal everyman kind of guy can solve his problem, because the world is set up for that to actually be doable. So literary fiction would have to give us role models of exceptional people, making it hard to empathize, whereas genre fiction can give us normal people as role models, allowing readers to see and make the connection?

give ur thoughts in the comments

Also, in the comments: define your intellectual, moral, and heroic qualities in fictional character terms. For example, I'm basically Comic Book Guy plus Ben Stiller's character from /Dodgeball./

I really, really liked Scout, from /To Kill a Mockingbird/, but the exemplar is her father Atticus Finch, who has explicitly served as a role model for lawyers, to the point that the Alabama State Bar [[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oOl_Fy2tuwY/U1m8p8_StTI/AAAAAAAAiTs/hC0r-P3uvA0/s1600/IMG_5418+-+Copy.JPG][made a monument to his name]].

** Worm doesn't really have role models - that's part of what makes it such a good story. The characters do cool things, decent things, but not because they are role-model-level perfect.

I don't want unrealistic characters or easy successes. In a tragedy, I want to be able to think it could have ended well - in the opposite, that it could have ended in failure.

That said, there are virtuous/heroic characters in shakespeare too - Macbeth is ostensibly a tragedy, but the result is good for the kingdom, and the person who becomes king is somewhat shown to deserve the role.

** I think the "why" of it is related to why it seems like artists in great pain make better art, but it's not like I have a great answer to that, either.

There are a few authors that are genre, but on the more literary end of things: Most/all of Asimov and Zelazny. Louis McMaster Bujold (the stuff after her military SF).

For individual books - these get way more "literary": Child of Fortune by Norman Spinrad, Dune*, Diaspora by Greg Egan, The Martian.

- I don't know if this counts as "not depressing", but it's definitely a role model source for me.

I /want/ to say Ursula Le Guin, but I honestly don't remember well enough. Still, check out "The Dispossed", not just Earthsea.

China Mieville's "Embassy Town" finally managed to teach me what "literature" is (I can't explain the idea the story conveys without telling you story), but it's not what I'd call "feel-good".

Maybe the problem is like that R!Lucius tells R!Draco about the play: If the writer was clever enough to solve the problem, they'd do it, instead of writing about it.

As for myself in fictional terms - Ehhh maybe a cross between Twig's Sylvester, a Mentat, annnnnd the weird wise wanderer? Sometimes I think my life is half-fictional already, the shenanigans I get up to.

(I have a friend who really should be all the way fictional. Her idea of summer camp is an archeological dig at the great pyramids; her idea of poker is winning money from Richard Branson while transiting the bearing straight; her idea of a vacation is hitch hiking across Nicuragua solo, at 19. She gets it from her dad, who's similarly wtf).

*** The thing about suffering is that it stress-tests one's ability to spin meaning out of life, which can sometimes lead one to abandon cliche philosophy and form a more reasoned and complete answer to the question "why do you live". I say "sometimes" because this is unlikely enough that breaking people does not create a net gain, but the outliers gain a hell of a lot of individuality in the process.

Art is, in one way or another, an expression of one's worldview. Therefore, people with unusual worldviews tend to produce "originality" and "wisdom". (The scare quotes are because I subscribe to Yudkowsky's theory that wisdom is simply having a coherent and well-reasoned viewpoint that diverges from the conventional.) Both of these are likely contributing factors to whether any given art piece is considered "good".

To put this syllogism together, suffering can create unusual worldviews, unusual worldviews are interpreted as "wisdom", and "wisdom" is probably one of the factors that leads to something being considered good art.

** Remember the discussions about how difficult it is to write a character smarter than you? I posit that there is a corollary - it is difficult-to-impossible to write a character more efficacious than yourself, given the same constraints. Genre writers get to play around with the constraints. Even if they may be ineffective in their actual lives, "what if I had magic", or "what if I were on a spaceship" may trigger different thought patterns that allow them to punch above their normal weight class in regards to problem-solving creativity.

On the other hand, someone writing literary earthfic is constrained to realistic solutions for realistic problems. If you struggle to maintain or improve satisfying relationships irl, you'll probably struggle to write a character who can accomplish the feat, in a way that seem realistic to readers. To paraphrase EY, if the writer knew how to actually take over the world, they wouldn't be writing a story about world domination, they'd be sipping the drink of their choice from the caldera-heart of their Volcano Lair. If the writer knew how to mend relationships, find career success and rightfully earn the admiration of worthy peers, they'd probably be doing that instead of putting in time at a writers workshop.

This is not to say that all people using writers workshops are failures, or anything. But it seems likely that the people you're seeing there are more likely than average to be generally ineffective in the rest of their lives, which will naturally make it difficult for them to write characters who can do things they themselves /could/ do, but probably struggle with.

So, with that constraint on what you can actually write well about, I'd imagine many of those literary writers can /easily/ imagine how to send the functional parts of their lives crashing down in flaming wreckage. Every pessimistic fantasy in which your SO gets dramatically furious about something becomes a plot point. All the things that existential terror suggests you /could/ do, that you /wouldn't/ do because you don't want to burn all bridges become easy sources of conflict to write about. It may be depressing as hell, but it's at least more conceivable than the magical formula to success that you've never actually figured out.

#+end_quote

But it's /not/ hard to write a character at least somewhat smarter than you. As the author you can easily give your character two things you can't have in reality -- unlimited time to think things through and perfect deductive knowledge.

You know when something happens unexpectedly, and you go over and over it later in your mind figuring out what the optimal response would have been? You can easily write a character that thinks faster than you do and can come up with those optimal reactions on the fly. In fact, almost all fictional characters do this to at least some extent -- that's how you have clean, sharp, witty, hard hitting dialog so much more often in books than in real life.

Inhumanly perfect deductive knowledge is what Sherlock Holmes runs on. In real life drawing deductions from events and details is difficult and fraught with errors, alternate interpretations, and gaps in one's knowledge, generally producing a range of fuzzy possibilities. In fiction this is not a problem. As the author you have all the knowledge about the setting and characters, and can grant that knowledge to your characters at will.

Done poorly this results in insane yet correct Bat/Tattletale deductions, and taken to extremes you get an omniscient Sherlock Holmesien superintelligence who knows the reason behind the fall of every sparrow and the disposition of every grain of dust, but every author does it at least a little, as when they grant knowledge of one character's thoughts to another character and justify it with some line about seeing their expression or the way they move.

In a way, the author's perfect knowledge of the fictional universe and of cause and effect in it is a form of superinteligence. I think one of the reasons superintelligent characters are rare is because the have the same problems as post foom AIs -- they are boring because they always know the path to victory in any situation, and so they will win no matter what. Essentially, a Mary Sue. To make it interesting you have to have an opposing superintelligence, and then write the conflict between them in a believable, interesting, and understandable to lesser intelligences (aka humans) way. And THAT's what's /really/ difficult.

As far as realism goes, you can easily apply heightened intelligence to reality or stories trying to be set in reality. For lower levels of enhanced intelligence, hard work and drive is functionally equivalent to intelligence. A character in a best approximation of reality who ignores fatigue and boredom to acquire skills or accomplish objectives is displaying a form of low level enhanced intelligence.

People look at Superman, or Sherlock Holmes, and say "I'll never be that good. I'm inadequate." Or they look at a story about some guy solving his problems, and they feel inadequate because they have not solved their problems.

And then they turn to a story of a miserable guy getting steadily more miserable and say "At least I'm better off than /that/ guy." And this leaves them feeling good about their situation, despite the problems they haven't solved.

I think there are ways to do this well. To switch mediums for a moment, I would describe both /BoJack Horseman/ and /Jessica Jones/ as stories about broken people becoming even more broken, and I loved them a lot.

(If the claim is in some way specific to novels in particular, then examples are springing less to mind at the moment, but perhaps /The World According to Garp/ would qualify, or the first /Magicians/ novel before reading the sequels.)

Yes, /Anna Karenina/ and /Antigone/ are miserable, but I don't think we can blame the entire concept of fiction about broken people become more broken for that.

** The way TV Tropes frames this argument on their page about how to write characters, is that characters are defined by their Virtues and Flaws. Virtues make us say "I want to be this character", while Flaws make us say "I am this character". Success is meant to inspire us to conquer our own obstacles, while failure is meant to create empathy for a situation we can relate to. That doesn't make me like them, though.

I hate depressing stories and love heroism. I didn't even finish Worm because I couldn't take Armsmaster's dickishness, Leviathan, Taylor being set back to square one, the Slaughterhouse 9, the Protectorate screwing up, and a malicious conspiracy in rapid succession without any levity or successes beyond surviving. It was just so much that I was starting to see Taylor's determination as foolhardy instead of admirable.

For what character I relate to, I was going to say Ender if he had a lot more internal obstacles to face, but the one I identify with the most is the protagonist of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3pyg3h/wp_a_day_before_the_earth_is_destroyed_by_a/][this story]].

While watching Log Horizon, I began to identify more and more strongly with Shiroe with each episode. I'm a strong leader and a powerfull multitasker; I have an aptitude for unique, lateral-thinking solutions utilising all the disparate resources at my disposal; and, like Shiroe, I have not yet realized that a full half of the women I know secretly harbor romantic feelings for me.

** I write stories about people slowly breaking because I was subject to a significant amount of psychological trauma when I was very young and therefore have an inbuilt assumption that things by default get worse. I have been able to bend my built-in story trajectory upwards a /little/, with an immense amount of work.

Also, part of the process of bending that trajectory upwards involves me actively continuing to write stories about people slowly breaking, just in fractionally less horrifying situations each time, and actively continuing to read stories about people slowly breaking, /also/ in situations that have become somewhat less terrible as my tastes have been able to expand upwards.

If I did not think it was worth it to bend this trajectory upwards I would not be doing it.

**** I can see you trying to make light of the situation because this glance into the abyss is making you uncomfortable. If you insist on me answering the character question, though, I'll say Rose Lalonde from /Homestuck/, except replacing the lesbianism with luminosity.
