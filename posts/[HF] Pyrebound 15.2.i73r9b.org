There's a map in the navigation bar now; I put something together in Wonderdraft. A map isn't strictly necessary, given how linear the Dominion is, but it should give you some sense of how all these pyres fit together. Anyhow, [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/08/10/chapter-15-2/]] is here. For those of you who don't know, Pyrebound is a hard, dark fantasy serial in an ancient-Mesopotamia-flavored world. There's lots of skullduggery and an underdog protagonist. It begins [[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/][here]]. Thank you!
