This is all pretty basic stuff, but a lot of people tend to make mistakes with it, so I'm going to present some definitions and basic arguments for what fiction is. I find myself making this rant a lot, and it takes a long time to explain, so I'm posting it here. It's mostly on topic. I'd greatly appreciate any feedback.

The main misunderstanding is when people say things like "It's a movie." as explanations for in story events. The necessary clarification is that there is a difference between a story and a series of suppositions.

This could potentially be more organized, but reddit has a post length limit that I've greatly exceeded.

--------------

A story has two parts. There's the premise, then there's the elaboration. The premise is always of the form "Suppose the reality were like the real world, except [list of facts].". The elaboration is, "Then [list of events] might happen.". A premise cannot be wrong. It can be silly, or boring, or arbitrary, but since the story /supposes/ that, we assume it is true when reading the elaboration. Once the premise is assumed, the elaboration must follow from the premise in order for the story to be believable. The believability of a story the probability of the elaboration happening conditioned on the premise being true. When the premise includes a sufficiently whimsical omnipotent character, then literally anything logically possible can be believable, and when anything is possible, then nothing is interesting. If the premise of the story is that there's a guy who can make lawnmowers impervious to gravity on Wednesdays, then it does not follow that he'd forget his mother's name.

The premise is always "Suppose reality were like the real world, except [blah]" instead of just "Suppose [blah]" because it is not necessary to suppose something that is already true. If we didn't look at it this way, then every author would have to establish a ridiculously long list of basic assumptions, like that the characters are made out of atoms, that consistent laws of physics exist in their universe, that humans typically have exactly two arms, that humans do not spontaneously explode when thinking about prime numbers between 15 and 97, and so on, and so on.

When writing the story, you have to have a premise, and then write the elaboration based on that premise. When reading a story, you see part of the elaboration and premise in the text, and deduce the rest of the premise and the rest of the elaboration. The interpretation of the story is the extra stuff you see as the premise and elaboration that is not explicitly stated in the story.

The entire premise does not have to be explicitly spelled out anywhere, even by the end. It certainly shouldn't be explained until the end in a mystery. The premise is made up of the explicit premise and the implicit premise. The explicit premise is that which is stated about the initial state of the world and its rules in the text, on panel, on screen, etc. The explicit elaboration is the set of events that are explicitly stated in the text, on panel, on screen, etc. The implicit elaboration is the rest of what the reader thinks of as happening beyond the explicit elaboration. The implicit premise is what the reader thinks of as being part of the rules and initial state of the world beyond the explicit premise.

It is necessary to have an implicit elaboration. Suppose that we did not. Then comic book stories would have no events in between panels. They would exist purely as a discrete list of frames. It would be (mostly) meaningless to discuss notions of "speed" except in relation to the "frame rate". Written stories would be lists of atomic facts about the in-story universe. Consider this story: "Once upon a time, Wonder Woman went to the grocery store and bought an apple.". Without an implicit elaboration, we couldn't even say "Wonder Woman payed some positive amount of money for the apple she bought at the grocery store.". We cannot insert any facts into the story beyond what is explicitly stated. This is extremely strange and clearly a weird/bad way of thinking about stories, so we include the concept of the implicit elaboration.

The implicit premise is also necessary. Suppose that we didn't include it. Then any story that leaves out any detail of what the author supposes would get a massive and unfair impact to its believability. If it's never the case that a narrator states "Superman has the ability to fly." then every single time Superman flies, the story takes an incredibly large hit to believability. It's also impossible to close many plot holes without an implicit premise.

Together, the implicit elaboration and implicit premise form the interpretation of the reader. Not all interpretations are equally good. There is no evidence that Superman regularly eats hobo brains off panel, even though it is never explictly stated that he does not. It is unlikely given the explicit premise and explicit elaboration. *The believability of a story with a given interpretation is the probability of its entire elaboration given its entire premise. The satisfyingness of an interpretation is inversely proportional to how large/complicated the implicit premise is.* The quality of an interpretation is determined by its believability and satisfyingness. For the moment, ignore factors like how entertaining the story actually is. The relative importance of satisfyingness and believability is a matter of opinion, but when believability is (somehow) held constant, quality decreases as satisfyingness decreases, and when satisfyingness is (somehow) held constant, quality decreases as believability decreases. "It was all a dream / drug trip / hallucination / Descartes' demon / inside the Matrix." is unsatisfying, even though it makes any implicit elaboration entirely believable. If anything is possible, then nothing is interesting. If you assume the entire elaboration, then you're just looking at the story like a list of fictional events with no patterns, rules, or structure. If you assume none of the premise, then anything that is not explicitly stated to be possible before it happens is a breach of believability. Both of these are silly ways to look at stories.

Note that believability requires that the /entire/ interpretation be believable, whereas satisfyingness only requires that the implicit premise be satisfying. I think it's reasonable to put a complexity penalty on the explicit premise also, but if you do, it should be a much, much smaller one. It is reasonable to tell a story about a large, complicated premise. It's not reasonable to suppose an auxilliary large complicated premise when a small one will do.

Consider Tolkien's collected works. They have a very large premise and implicit interpretation. It is a good thing that it is such a well-developed world with an elaborate history. A historical fiction where the only significant premise is that Socrates was a woman is not necessarily better than LOTR just because it has a smaller implicit premise. There are a few ways to resolve this. First of all, for fantasy novels, it's expected that there will be a large premise, so one should weight the complexity penalty lower. Second of all, believability and satisfyingness are not the only aspects of quality of a story. Personally, if a story is funny enough, then I don't care at all how believable or satisfying it is. I will note, of course, that humor has its own rules and you can't just write whatever you want and expect it to be funny. A lot of it is about subverting expectations, and without consistent rules, there are no expectations to subvert.


** Let's look at a few examples.

Example 1:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim who had superhuman jumping. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon.
#+end_quote

Here, "Tim has superhuman jumping." is part of the explicit premise, so we don't have to add it to the implicit premise. The story is directly believable.

Example 2:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon.
#+end_quote

In order for Tim jumping across the canyon to be likely, we have to assume a much larger premise than what is explicitly stated. The probability of Tim successfully jumping across the canyon given only established facts of the story is extremely small, so it requires a larger assumption, a larger suspension of disbelief. If we assume that Tim is insane or on a drug trip or being deceived by Descartes' demon, then anything is believable, but this is an unsatisfying premise. Saying that it's all a dream is like saying there is absolutely no plausible explanation for what happened, so we have to assume the entire thing in order to talk about it. We can make a much smaller assumption, namely that Tim is superhuman in some way, or that the story takes place on a planet with much less gravity than Earth.

Example 3:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon. After work, he jumped back across the canyon.
#+end_quote

It has already been established in this story that Tim can jump long distances, though it hasn't been explained why. Therefore, jumping back across the canyon does not require any extension of the premise. This is about equally believable and satisfying as the previous story.

Example 4:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon. After work, he was unable to get home.
#+end_quote

This requires another extension of the premise! Tim was able to jump across the canyon to get to work, but he wasn't able to jump back. Now we have to assume that he has the power to jump long distances, but only sometimes. We have to assume a very large implicit premise. In fact, it might be better to assume that there was some other obstacle preventing him from getting home, because the canyon didn't pose a problem for him in the morning.

Example 5:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Superman was fighting a potato. They fought until there was a winner.
#+end_quote

In this case, there is a lot missing from the elaboration. It is not stated who won, or how they fought, or for how long. This does not mean that all interpretations of what happened are equally valid. We have to pick the interpretation of the story which is best with respect to believablity and satisfying-ness. It is not at all believable that Superman would lose against a potato. It is not at all satisfying to assume that there is anything extraordinary about the potato, or about the situation in which Superman fights the potato when we have the perfectly valid implicit elaboration of Superman winning, which does not require any additional implicit premise. Therefore it is better to include "Superman wins." in the (implicit) interpretation than "Superman loses.".

Example 6:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, the moon was made of cheese. Maybe I ate it.
#+end_quote

In order for me eating the moon to be believable, you have to assume that I am able to eat the moon's mass in cheese, that I am able to physically get to the moon, or have it brought to me, and that I would want to eat the entire moon. This is an extremely large premise. The implicit elaboration where I ate the moon requires a dramatic extension of the premise or an utterly unbelievable extension to the elaboration. It is therefore unreasonable to interpret the story as being about me eating the moon.

** Out of story explanations explain why the author attempted to design the story in a certain way, but they do not explain why in story events happen. This includes word of god statements. The author's perspective is "just" a (usually) very well-thought interpretation of the story. If there's a better interpretation, one that fills a plot hole and still explains the events while remaining believable, then it is superior to the author's perspective. I see no reason to read a story and think "What would (person in the real world) think about whether Lex Luthor thought of this idea?" when you can just say "Would Lex Luthor think of this idea?". I see no reason to make an exception for the author. Again, a story is "Suppose reality were like the real world except [blah]. Then [blah] might happen.". The person telling you this sentence is not a part of the story. They are just the messenger. You don't put the whole book in quotes and say "said Charles Dickens" at the end.

The main problem with this "theory of fiction" is that it doesn't allow for breaking the fourth wall. Under the theory as it is, if someone breaks the fourth wall then certain characters either randomly speak to no one or "falsely" believe that they are in a story (falsely because within the story, they are not within a story). This leads to problems for stories like Homestuck or Deadpool. Homestuck is a mess on its own and I'm not going there, but characters in that story actually don't break the fourth wall much, they just interact with a direct author avatar. I'm not an expert on Homestuck since I haven't read it in years so I'll leave it at that. Deadpool remains a problem.

As a brief side note, games are not necessarily stories. The Stanley Parable is not a story. It is an interactive experience, a fantastic interactive experience that cannot possibly be experienced in any medium but gaming. The agency of the player is an essential element. I highly recommend it. I won't talk about the details because it's really a case where the less you know about it before you play, the better.

Another aspect of story-telling is, for lack of a better term, the content vs the lens. I will explain it hoping that it will fix the fourth wall problem. The lens is the medium through which you are experiencing the story. If you're watching TV and some static comes across the screen, the static is not a part of the story. It's a part of the lens. Animated characters often live in worlds with lots of solid colors, TV shows sometimes have mysterious logos pop up that follow the camera without the characters noticing, anime characters sometimes go black and white or have a giant water drop appear next to their heads, comic book characters live in little boxes, and so on. These are a part of the presentation of the story, not the content. Sometimes it's appropriate to consider them to be "literal" aspects of the story, such as Looney Toons characters stretching, zooming, and surviving anvils dropped on their heads. In other cases, it's unreasonable to think of a water droplet appearing next to the heads of exasperated anime characters. I'm not sure how to mathematically define when it is better to consider something a part of the lens or part of the content. I'm open to suggestions. For things like censorship, it's unclear. Suppose the author leaves a story open-ended as to whether the main character kills the villain at the end, and that the story is a show for young children. It is likely that if they main character had killed the villain, it would have been censored. Based on in-story events (suppose) it's more likely the main character would kill the villain. If the censorship is part of the lens, then the main character killed the villain, but if it's part of the content, then the main character didn't kill the villain. It's unclear to me which view is "better". It's easy to get a little bogged down in specific examples so I don't want to belabor this one too much. I'd like to be able to crisply define which is better like I did with believability vs satisfyingness, but I don't know how. I'd love to get feedback on this.

Plot armor is a property of the story, not a property of the characters. Plot armor means that in story, probabilities are locally skewed such that certain characters survive in a way that does not follow in-story physics. This means that believability is going to take a significant hit every time the main characters are in danger until the believability is low enough to support an added probability warping power to the implicit premise. In terms of predicting what the author will do next, it is appropriate to consider this, but in predicting what would likely happen next after a given point, it should not be taken into account.

Part of the fundamental assumption of a story is that there is a story to tell. Certain things must happen in order for the story to be worth experiencing. These still incur a believability/satisfyingness penalty. A good author should be able to make these things happen using in-story rules.

Deadpool's power is that he is aware that he is in a story, the medium of the story, and certain real-world knowledge (along with his nonproblematic in-universe powers). This description is slightly wrong, because it requires author interaction in order for it to work. Remember that a story is "Suppose it were like the real world except [blah]. Then [blah] might happen.". This doesn't fit with Deadpool somehow knowing that we are supposing about him. Deadpool can't know that we are supposing about him, not always, because we can suppose that he didn't know. One could argue that it's like supposing that Aang couldn't waterbend, and I'm not sure if that argument holds weight or not. The point is that Deadpool's power as advertised is a property of the story AND of how the story is being told, not of the in-universe character. I think the best way to think of it along with this perspective of fiction is that Deadpool's 4th wall breaking ability is a promise of the author to tell the story in a certain way, a metarule that supersedes the in-universe laws of physics, like the Comic Code forbidding and demanding certain outcomes regardless of their in-universe probability. It's part of the lens.
