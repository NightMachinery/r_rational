** Lets see:

- Has an extremely rare variant of an already rare pokemon
- Acheived notable success despite lacking support or resources (first badge)
- Is destined for greatness according to ancient myth (Ho-oh)
- Is skilled and capable despite lack of proper training

Yep, I think Aiko is secretly The Protagonist. I wonder how the others will react when they realize they aren't the main characters? Leaf and Red will probably be fine, but Blue will be /devastated./

*** I'd be kind of disappointed if this story only has one main protagonist. I read HPMOR, and liked it, but I felt like the element of the prophecy really restricted the roles Hermione and Draco could play in a story that wanted to fit all of Harry Potter canon into first year.

I'm excited for The Origin of Species because I expect all of the three view point protagonists to achieve something 'Main Character Worthy'.

That being said, I really do want Aiko to become a view point character next chapter. If Red is in training to become 'The Professor', and Blue wants to be 'The Champion', and Leaf will eventually become something like a wandering reporter, Aiko seems to be the closet Origin of Species has to a traditional Pokemon protagonist, like Ash Ketchum, adventuring not because she wants to learn more about Pokemon, or wants to be the best Pokemon trainer, but simply because she loves Pokemon. And I do wonder how that kind of worldview is going to meshed into this rational reinterpretation of canon.

*** I feel like having a shiny pokemon isn't usually the /sort/ of special that makes you a protagonist, especially in rational fic. (definitely the others, though).

For myself, I suspect that the intersection of a legendary pokemon hunter, the strongest and best battler in Kanto, a psychic researcher who probably understands orthogonality, and a journalist who also happens to be one of the few people with an ethical system that a Pokemon might agree with is going to culminate in a big Mewtwo arc, and all of them are going to be essential.

** Another pretty awesome chapter!

I wonder, is Red right now essentially the psychic equivalent of a savant? Weak to nonexistent telekinesis, slightly crippled telepathy, but a unique, highly developed (compared to other psychics, who apparently can't do it all) ability to passively, and stealthily detect attempted intrusions into his mind. Because Red training so hard that he could become useful to the Mewtwo project would require you making an unforeshadowed sudden genius. But the Mewtwo project being interesting in a savant with a relevant skill that could be made useful without having to be told to much....

Also, considering that Red can do something that apparently no other psychic (human or pokemon) can, he might be the one person with something to offer Mew-two. Perhaps in order to learn Recover, Mew-two doesn't have to just mimic what Alakazam does, but actually force his mind into the exact same mental-state or something? Perhaps Recover isn't like mental math or calculation, which can be learnt by mimicking the rules others follow, but is actually like the No-Thought state I hear about in meditation, and must actually be discovered and experienced for oneself. Or in this case, psychically enforced on oneself.

Because I've been thinking, and my personal theory is that the reason Mew-two can't use Recover is because his mind is too human. Normally his increased intelligence combines with his Pokemon granted abilities to make him truly powerful. But when it comes to Recover, maybe there is something about full human consciousness that prevents the ability from working? Maybe full human consciousness and intelligence is actually a self-affecting psychic move humans are running all the time, and isn't mutually inclusive with Recover? Who knows?

Anyway, to get back on point, I just think that Red's journey, and unique psychic abilities, leading him to discover a way for humans to use Recover would be an awesome; and the thing about human intelligence, in the PokeVerse, just being a psychic move has always been my personal fan theory. I never got how in Pokemon some people can be psychic if everybody else wasn't at least a little bit psychic (for example in real life some savants are really good at math, and some people with synaesthesia can see numbers as colors or taste sights, or etc... but everybody else can also do math, or taste and see), and I always believed that psychics were just humans powerful enough, or lucky enough, to learn other 'Moves'.

Anyways, I know you can't deny or confirm a lot my story predictions and theories, but I hope you found these ramblings at least a little bit amusing :)

*** I try to make it a point to comment on every one, and IM not stopping yet :P

I like what you did with surge. Good character concept, modified well to be within your world, but still makes perfect sense in canon.

I don't like that red isn't going for badges at all. He could clearly get one (you even mentioned it yourself) and I see 0 downsides to getting one. Especially the thunder badge, as it is clear he wants to train people for emergency responses, and red should love having some psuedo ranger training.

I find the name changes to be interesting. it shows that he doesnt ever really want to use the abra in combat, OR that the brainwashing is more powerful than I thought

The myths are interesting. If you want the whole world to be perfectly rational, I'm curious how you are going to handle the reality warping.

For some reason it still feels weird to me to see things like "a kalos district" I think that is just me being used to the game worlds almost never referencing the other regions.

Excellent chapter, while some I complain about, these are the ones I am here for :P

Is there any actual upside to getting badges in this setting though? In the games they let you use HMs and train pokemon to a higher level, but in this setting all I can think of is that they're required to challenge the Elite Four, which Red has no interest in.

It occurs to me, however, that with the advent of easy teleportation if they ever change their minds they can go back and challenge the gyms very easily - even more easily than by using Fly, given that unlike in the games flight does have a travel time.

*** Red had the dual advantage of a novel strategy that lets him use coordinated attacks with excellent timing and experience in at least 2 leader level catastrophes. Even given identical other resources he would probably have the edge. I would compare his current battle ability to chapter 1 Blue, with the lack of combat instinct and training made up for in real world experience and tactics.

Leaf is an entirely different situation. I feel like even though she's been in the same situations, her goals and thoughts about them are different enough that they wouldn't help her nearly as much in a battle. She also cares too much about Pokemon to put her all into a battle that isn't protective.

I think that Red would be able to earn three Thunder badge if he worked his way up through the gym, but Leaf wouldn't be able to handle the militaristic nature of Lt. Surge.

Both could almost certainly get their first badges at this point, if they put their minds to it: they've been journeying for months now, and even though they have less trainer experience than Blue, they've fought in wild situations and have spent time training their pokemon.

** I have to say, I'm /extremely/ disappointed with the direction you took the Vermilion gym. Lt. Surge's role in encouraging young trainers to rummage through random trash cans until something happens is foundational to my experience of the Pokemon universe. ^{^{/s}}

That being said, this truly was a great chapter. I actually am finding myself quite drawn to Leaf's story arch. I think there is a lot of cool work to do in Utopian literature now that Social Media has been invented.

Also, I have been doing a bit of reading during the down time at my new job, and I found it pleasing that the past-chapter I had just read was the very one were the Ho-oh myth was first mentioned.

I thought I had while rereading that I may as well comment here: Are Ground-type Pokemon actually Rubber-polymer type Pokemon? Similar to steel type, what makes a pokemon "Ground-type" is some kind of material infusion that makes them particularly flexible and therefore good at maneuvering beneath the earth. As a side effect, they are not very conductive, giving them their signature Electricity-immunity in game. Nothing particluarly "groundy" about a Gligar or a Mudbray, but they are all still adapted to be immune to electrical attacks.

The main exceptions are pokemon that are dual-rock type, and Claydol and Golurk lines. All seem to actually be made of earth in some way, and can do more than just push earth around. The dual rock types are easily explainable by the rock types, and perhaps the claydol and golurk were made of a similarly non-conductive material, so people just assumed they were also Ground types because of it.

Can't wait for the next chapter!

#+end_quote

My basic idea for this is that for most pokemon "Ground Type" is an emergent property of pokemon that can travel beneath the ground or rely heavily on it for their maneuverability and attacks, which leads to them having a strong resistance/immunity to electric attacks in most situations. Pokemon that seem like clear exceptions to this like gligar and mudbray are the "physiologically unique" ones that actually carry their immunity around with them, but also have some "earthy" properties that link them to the Ground typing, unlike many other pokemon that are immune to electricity without being Ground types (Lightning Rod ability).

**** I was wondering what your take on the fossil Pokemon is, regarding their consistently present rock-type. My hypotheses are as follows:

1: The rock type is introduced as a (currently) unavoidable consequence of fossil revivification, making them more "genetically engineered theme park monsters" than true prehistoric species.

2: Only rock-type Pokemon had the sort of biology that is sufficiently conserved during fossilisation that they can be revived (either as a fundamental property or, again, as a limitation of current technology).

3: Consistent with Brock's beliefs, life really did come from rocks, thus species from earlier epochs were more likely to retain that trait than modern species. Fossil Pokemon are thus type-transitional forms.

4: A misleading coincidence.

#+end_quote

On my first read, I read this as "That first day, as Blue walked across the campus to start his challenge matches, *[he]* watched a formation of gym members jogging side by side with their pokemon." Eventually I figured it out.

While I think the whole bit could probably be revised, just getting rid of the first comma would help with the readability:

Because "He's got" is short for "He has got", the rest of the list reads like "He has old" and "He has good" (rather than "he is old" and "he is good"). Quick suggestions:

Original -> "He's old and strong enough to travel on his own, good at listening and following orders while still being creative in accomplishing them, and he's got three badges."

OR

Also feels slightly inconsistent with /some/ parts of his character that this apparent hesitation to battling exists. For example, his promise with red to fight legendary birds. Or was he planning on helping outside of battle?

When Aiko first joined the group, the Red/Aiko chemistry was pretty clear, with Aiko giving off some mad hero-worship eyes. Here though we got some good Leaf/Aiko bonding over shared values, with some added teasing thrown in. No real romantic sparks though, but its a foundation.

Also Blue totally noticing Aiko's hairstyle, a classic sign of interest! But I still think Red/Aiko has the most cards in play.

** A short critique of P:TOoS.

Strong points: * Easy to connect with, even if you are out of the rat community! * The characters showcase rationality skills in a way easy to replicate. * Introduces weird ideas in a way that makes sense in universe, like pokeballs / cryogenics and AI safety / mewtwo

Weaknesses: * I think the start of the series is rather bland. Until the chu's attack in the forest I did not feel committed to the story. * The stakes during the interludes are mismatched with the stakes in the main story, which makes the main story seem dull by contrast, which I do not think it is! * The way AI Safety is talked about in Bill's house feels rather condescending and violates the 'show don't tell' principle. This is in stark contrast with how cryogenics / pokeballs or AI Safety / Mewtwo is handled.

** Woah man, did I arrive to this month's party late, on the plus side, 99 comments to read!

First off, its crazy that Vermilion City would let some crazy kids up on to the roof of an 80 story building overlooking the coast; those girls must have some crazy courage to just nonchalantly talk about their aspirations under strong winds while looking over a drop to their doom. Good thing that didn't happen, hey? ;]

That bit about how container tech would change the nature of the ports and the city's layout was really interesting. I can only imagine how the introduction of affordable teleportation would further impact the nature of Vermilion's port city status. Maybe it'll end up competing with Cerulean as a seaside resort kind of place, but with the added benefits of peninsulas such as calmer beaches and more prime real estate. Only time will tell I guess.

That veteran trainer Lin got me curious, do trainers often go challenge other leagues aside from their first? It seems as though challenging the e4 and champion is rarely done in this world, but it seems that there are basically zero gym challengers attempting the Kanto league coming in from other regions.

Anyways, happy Halloween to everybody who celebrates it!

Assuming you mean trainers who live in that region, and not people from other regions who grew up there, there are, but it's not common: to be Champion in more than one region doesn't hold a lot of extra political benefit, if anything it kind of shows a lower devotion to your own region (since you're obviously not sticking around to help it out), and so very few trainers care to: only those who are really devoted to getting as strong as they can be and finding every challenge available to them.

Thanks for reading, and happy Halloween :)
