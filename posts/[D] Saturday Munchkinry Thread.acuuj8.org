Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Still taking a break from the Mistborn mini-series due to not having the books here, so how about munchkinning a power from the long list of stories-that-I-will-probably-never-write?

(Apologies, again, for the length. I appear to be unable to write these things in a concise way)

You are an Archivist, this means that you can perform a ritual that establishes a mental connection between yourself and another person, this other person thereby becomes an Archive.

*The ritual*

The ritual requires a deliberate act of will for both parties, but does not otherwise require a willing participant (the target can be tricked or forced to participate). From the words spoken during the ritual it is clear that the Archivist will be able to access the memories of the Archive, but the details are vague so misrepresenting what someone is signing up for is definitely an option.

You can perform this ritual once a month, but there is otherwise no limit to the number of Archives you can create.

The target of the ritual must posses a sentient, biological mind that has reached a certain level of development and is very similar in design to that of the Archivist. In practice, this means only other humans older than, say, 14 years old are able to become Archives (assume this clause has enough asterixes that hacking the definition of human is not a viable approach).

Once the ritual is complete, the Archive gains a number of useful abilities:

*Perfect memory*:

From the moment the ritual is completed the Archive never forgets anything, their memories do not fade or change with time like they do for normal humans. This power only applies to long term memory and it does not repair existing memories from before the ritual, though it does prevent those memories from fading further.

*Enhanced knowledge aquisition*:

Archives can acquire new information and skills at a rate vastly quicker than regular people. This includes mental skills like playing chess or solving a rubix cube, but also skills that rely on muscle memory like juggling or sports. They do not, however, develop the corresponding physical strength and endurance any faster than a regular person would, nor do they become any more intelligent or creative than they were before.

An Archive could become an excellent tennis player (on a technical level) in a few weeks, but might still lose to a merely competent, but physically stronger, player. They will also never be able to compete with the best tennis players in the world if they didn't already have that weird combination of good genetics, competive nature and willpower that makes a top athlete.

Similarly, Archives are no more capable of applying their knowledge than they would be if they had acquired it the normal way. An Archive can develop PHD level knowledge of a field in months, but that does not automatically allow them to produce new insights in that field if they didn't already have that weird combination of intelligence, creativity and passion that makes a good academic researcher.

*Archives trance*

In addition to the above two abilities, the Archives mind also keeps a backup of the sensory input that they experience. This backup includes mental state, emotions and even simulated sensory experiences like dreams or the voices you hear when subvocalizing.

An Archive can enter into a trance where they can relive any part of the backed up experience at higher or lower than real time speeds, even pausing the stream when desired. This allows an Archive to recall experiences that didn't get converted into long term memories (they could, for instance, read through a book that they quickly paged through before). Using this ability requires the undivided attention of the Archive and while they are in the trance they become unable to observe the world around them.

*Mental limitations*

All of these powers come with one very serious downside. The human mind is limited in the amount of information it can store and remembering everything, learning a crazy number of new skills and storing a backup of everything you experience eats up a lot of mental disk space.

Once the amount of information in an Archive's brain reaches a certain threshold they lose the ability to make new long term memories. When this happens, the Archive cannot recall anything that happened between the moment the threshold was reached up until about 30 seconds before the current moment in time. Absent outside intervention, most Archives reach this threshold about two years after they first get their powers.

*The Archivist*

It is with this limitation that the Archivists own supernatural abilities come into play. An Archivist has access to the complete set of memories and skills of every Archive they are linked to as if they where their own.

An Archivist can also enter a trance similar to the Archives Trance where they can review the stored sensory inputs of any Archive they are linked to. In addition, while in this Archivists trance, they can also erase particular memories, skills or bits of stored sensory data to prevent the archive from running out of mental storage space.

Finally, an Archivist can store their own memories and skills or those of an Archive they are linked to in the mind of any other Archive they are linked to. The Archive is able to access any memories stored in their mind as if they were their own, but cannot use any skills that they did not originally learn themselves (only an Archivist brain is adaptable enough to use skills not originally theirs).

The bond between Archivist and Archive cannot be broken once established and an Archive cannot be linked to multiple Archivists. This means that if an Archivist dies all Archives linked to them are doomed to run out of mental storage space eventually.

*Further notes/limitations*

- Due to subtle differences in how people perceive the world it is always clear if a memory you have access to is originally yours or not. So no implanting fake memories.
- An Archivist can store about 8 years worth of sensory backup inside the mind of an Archive, but this would require wiping literally everything else, leaving the Archive with the mind of a newborn infant and unable to learn new things.
- With an Archivist that regularly cleans up memories and trims the sensory backup to maybe a few days of relevant footage there is very little chance that an Archive ever runs out of storage space for important things, but sorting through every new memory to determine if it should be kept or not is a lot of effort on the part of the Archivist (especially if they have to do it for multiple Archives).
- It is possible to remove an Archive's memory of participating in the ritual, but the perfect memory and increased learning are going to make it pretty obvious that something strange is going on.\\
- All interactions between Archive and Archivist are subject to speed of light delays.

*Scenario*

You learn all of this information when you and 700 other randomly chosen people are selected to become Archivists. You do not know who the other people are and you are all given your powers at the same time without the rest of the world knowing about it.

*Easy mode:* Turn off your ethical inhibitions. You are an amoral villain that wants to use this power to acquire as much wealth and influence as possible without ending up in jail or lynched by an angry mod. Keep in mind that there are 700 other people with the same powers as you, so sooner or later people are going to catch on to how things work. What do you do?

*Hard mode:* Turn your ethical inhibitions back on. You are a decent person who is kind of freaked out by the potential for abuse that these powers represent and only wants to use their powers if they can do so in an ethical manner. You want to limit the damage that other Archivists can cause while also maintaining a somewhat pleasant life for yourself and preferably improve the future of mankind. What do you do?

*** Question : If you manage to convince an archivist to become an archive then what happens? Would he have increased storage and do you have access to all the skills of his archives?

Other question : Are there other powers in this world and do you have access to them if you turn a power-holder into an archive?

I feel like you'd be able to abuse it pretty easily. Competitive people are willing to risk A LOT for immediate benefits disregarding problems for later. Google "Goldman's dilemma" => More than half the athletes would accept something that guarantee success even if they died 5 years later. If you were to offer a deal like that to an Olympic athlete he would probably take it in a heartbeat. If you were to offer a country like Russia or China the opportunity to contract their athletes, you'd get one delivered to your doorstep every month. The ability for an already talented person to reproduce his best jump, his best time on the race, his best shot on the day of the competition would immediately earn him a gold medal compared with other non-archives athletes. As for intellectual fields, the memory to not overlook anything in their field of study is invaluable for a researcher. They would probably be more careful than athletes to contract but you'd find some pretty easily.

And that's with being very open about the drawbacks. You wouldn't even have to trick people into accepting.

Huh, you know the thought of pitching the powers as super-doping never even crossed my mind? And I even mentioned profesional sports in the tennis example, I feel a bit silly now.

It's a very good pitch too: impossible to test for, magical abilities that are slowly becoming more prevalent in the news, but nobody knows the true limitations yet. All of your competitors are probably allready using it and you'll lose your competitive edge if you don't join them soon.

*Googles*. Jeesh, for real? Half of proffesional athletes? That.. is a much higher number than I would have guessed. Though a more recent study from 2009 apparently found a much lower percentage of people accepting it (6% if the treatment was legal, but deadly) so maybe things have gotten better since the nineties?

Thanks for the suggestion, that was an interesting read.

As for your questions:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I cut the bit that explained this from the description, but in short: the ritual fails in a very unpleasant (though non-lethal) way for all involved.

#+begin_quote
  Are there other powers in this world and do you have access to them if you turn a power-holder into an archive?
#+end_quote

Nope, no other powers. Which, incidently also means you have to convince people that something supernatural is going on in order to get them to take you seriously. Probably not particularly hard, but not really trivial either, given that you need to convince at least one person before you have any powers to demonstrate.

***** and I mean, if you do your side of the job consistently they wouldn't even need to experience real drawbacks. Just mass-wipe every sensory memory or even entire years instead of sorting memory by memory, that will give them enough space to go on for a few years before they come back again. I'd turn the power into a legitimate business, become the most well paid coach in the world as well as a superhuman athlete myself. If you're forward and have a good track record, people would seek you out rather than other archivists who haven't proved themselves.

You could also pitch it toward intelligence agencies. Imagine a spy or an undercover that never forget anything he comes across. He would be a super-agent. Super valuable. And on the plus side, the scary government people will never want to get rid of you, they'd want you to live a very long life so they can benefit. Might want to protect your identity in case other nations find out though

*** Unethical mode:

You can set up a tier system of how much memory maintenance your archives are going to get. For some very important ones, you actually clean things up in a reasonable and useful way. For many others, you just let them burn out, and either replace them or put them in a nursing home. It'd be worth experimenting with a medium maintenance tier, where you carefully store a year's worth of useful memories, and from then on do sloppy periodic maintenance. That is, the archive gets to remember their last 30-60 days, and you trim that back down to 30 once a month, which is crippling but livable.

If any of your archives betray you or become a liability, you can dump sensory backup on them. if there's too much risk of someone interviewing them to use your knowledge against you, you can prepare an archive with only completely useless memories (all your archives' memories of eating sandwiches) and dump that on people you want eliminated.

It's worth finding potential archives who are actually talented, driven, and unethical. You can always replace one if you find a better candidate. Your core personnel are someone who can research better mnemonics and mental archiving abilities, someone with strong salesmanship skills who can anonymously introduce you to potential archives (who probably has a lot of other criminal skills), a doctor for maintaining the houses full of people with no long term memory that you'll be leaving behind, and an investigator for finding other archives you can frame. You might want to reduce some of these people to medium maintenance if they're a threat.

You'll want to quickly assemble a team of money launderers, card counters, and hedge fund managers to gather your initial stockpile of cash before people catch on that archives exist. Speed is more important than subtlety here, since you should assume the secret will be out shortly regardless, and you'll be wiping these people's memories as soon as they become liabilities. Another potential route is stealing the identity of a reclusive billionaire, which you can do just by finding one with few enough friends/family and offering to make them an archive. I'd probably go with both.

Once the cat's out of the bag, I'd go much more reclusive until society readjusts to the fact that this exists (I expect witch hunts whenever someone is talented, which isn't sustainable), and carefully get more competent archives (who can clean up the messes you made during the initial blitz). From there you're a reclusive billionaire with a secondary pile of dark money, and a superpower, so accumulating influence should be easy.

** So there is this group who call themselves the Trident because there are three of them and they all have water or liquid based abilities. The first and arguably most powerful can control all water with a 30 meter radius of himself, forming it into water shape he pleases. However, he can only control water he can visibly see and can not change the state of said water into ice or steam and can only control it in it's liquid state.

The second turns all water he comes into contact with into acid which lingers for about an hour after he leaves. This acid is incredibly potent and can quickly erode steel and melt flesh. The bodily fluids he produces and are composed of are immune to these effects

The third member can super heat any water he comes into contact with, this includes the water that resides within living things. Despite this he only has a high resistance to things such as steam burns and usually wears a specialized suit to mitigate any damage to himself. The most he is normally able to super heat in any moment is in an area of exactly 3 meters in any direction. He must however have a direct physical connection to water he wants to super-heat, for instance if 2 two people are holding hands and he touches one of them both will explode.

I've been thinking of ways that they could synchronize their abilities to cause maximum damage or be the most combat effective. I've thought of a few but wanted to get some thoughts from the professional munchkinners.

*** So this seems pretty interesting but I need to know more specifics.

​

Shaper questions:

-What counts as "visibly seeing"? Can he work through glass? Translucent plastic? Through a microscope? What about a camera?

- How precise is his control? Could he move 1 gram of water 1 millimeter? How about 1 microgram 1 micron? Does this precision have any cost?

- You said he can't change the state of the water, but can he cool/heat it within that restriction? Or can he only move it?

- Does his power conduct, or does have to see all of the water he's controlling, at all times?

- How fast can he accelerate the water? If he uses velocity instead, what's the maximum velocity and how long does it take to get there?

​

Transmuter questions:

- You said the transmuter's acid will melt steel and flesh. What won't it melt? Real acids usually don't react with everything/./ For example, fluoroantimonic acid melts through glass but not teflon.

- How much matter can a given amount of transmuted acid dissolve?

- How fast does the transmuted acid work, exactly? Are we talking minutes or seconds?

- Does the transmuter's power conduct through contacting water, like the heater? If so, does it propagate, or will all of the water transmute at once?

- When you say "lingers", do you mean that the acid reverts to water? Suppose the acid melts something, producing a large amount of inert goo. What happens to the atoms that started out in the acid?

- What counts as leaving?

- Is the transmuter immune to his own acid?

​

Heater questions:

- You specified that the heater has an "area" of 3m. Do you mean he can heat any water within a 3m radius, or that he can heat a cone? If it's a cone, what angle? Does volume factor in at all?

- Does the heater heat all of the water at once, or does it propagate like a normal heat source?

- Can the heater control the amount of heating, or is his power either on or off? Can he make his shower water nice and warm or will it come out superheated no matter how hard he tries?

- What counts as a "bodily fluid"? If he puts water in his mouth and spits it out, will it be immune? How about if he swallows it? How long does it take to qualify?

- How much control does the heater have? If he has a tank of water, can he heat half of it but not the other half? What's the precision on his control, and does it have any additional costs?

- What counts as a "direct physical connection" for the heater? Will steam conduct his power? Ice? Can his power conduct through non-water substances, like through a layer of steel to heat water on the other side?

​

General questions:

- What costs are there to the powers? Can they use them forever without getting tired, having headaches, bloody noses, etc? Do they have to concentrate? Is there mana or other finite fuel?

**** 1.Visibly seeing as in with his own eye's, so yes that does mean he can manipulate water visible through translucent materials but not through camera's or microscopes.

1. Decently precise, as in he could probably use his power to grasp a pencil and write legibly with it. This however requires very intense concentration so he usually resorts to using broader moves.

2. He could conceivably move his water into situations where it's physical state could change but he can only control it within it's liquid state. It could be cold or hot but as long as it's liquid he can control it.

3. Yes it does conduct to a degree, as in all the water he controls becomes more like an extension of himself. However if he is blinded he is out for the count.

4. His acceleration depends on the amount he is controlling, in small amounts he could conceivably use it like a whip while at his maximum it is more like a wrecking ball. His absolute maximum velocity while controlling all the water he can would be around 100 mph which takes him about 3 minutes to reach in the open ocean.

5. The only materials completely resistant to his acid are glass and ceramics, but he does not know the full range of what it effects and to what degrees but he tests frequently.

6. Around 10x it's original mass

7. Varies depending upon the material in question, but usually it acts within seconds.(If you want a reference point, think of the xenomorphs blood).

8. The goo left behind will stay separated, for instance if you dropped a rubber ball in a small tube of this acid it will melt but when the acid returns to a water state the melted rubber will float to the top.

10- Leaving as in when he physically exits the body of water he is inhabiting. For instance if he jumped into a pool, turned all of it to acid, and then left it would take an hour to return to it's original state.

11- Yes.

12- Any water within a spherical 3m radius of himself.

13- His power is either on or off, he can only super heat water to explosive degrees. Despite his attempts at controlling his output.

14- Technically not all at once, it just propagates from his body incredibly fast.

15- Bodily fluid as in saliva, blood, mucus, etc...Just about any liquid the human body can create.

16- He does have precise control to a degree, in the water tank example he could theoretically heat any amount within his radius though he has to focus hard otherwise he'll just heat all of it.

1. Direct physical connection means skin on skin contact or water on skin contact. Steam will conduct his power as will ice, the explosive power drastically increases with ice but the inverse is true for steam. Nope, he must be in direct physical connection with the water for his power to work, which is why the only part of his body he usually leaves exposed is his hands.

-As for general costs, well all powers such as these are still physical abilities and can be strained to damaging degrees if someone doesn't have full control or knowledge of it, and even then someone with experience can slip up and injure themselves. This obviously varies based on the power in question but each have certain trade-offs and deeper implications. For instance someone with a quick regeneration power can only regenerate based on how much energy is stored in their body, once they run out their ability to regenerate ceases.

***** It's interesting that the shaper can see through glass or translucent plastic but not through a microscope, which is just a bunch of glass lenses. That's an inconsistency you should probably resolve. If he ends up being able to do it through a microscope then there's a ton of potential for abuse since he can build nanites.

​

​

1.  The shaper can form "wires" of water linking a target to himself or a teammate. This technique mostly negates the touch limitation. It's less effective if he can't make the wires super thin, but since it doesn't require the precision of handwriting it sounds like he can do it fairly easily.

2.  The heater can explode people. The transmuter can dissolve them. The shaper can rip them apart.

3.  The shaper can fly by enclosing himself in a hollow sphere of water linked to him with a wire. A sphere means he'll always see the water, so he won't accidentally fuck it up and fall to his death. He could also use the water as a defense against bullets etc, though ymmv since you said powers have limited resources available.

4.  The heater can vaporize nearby water to fill the area with steam and then conduct through that to reach stuff further away. It doesn't matter if the steam doesn't explode, it's just a conduit for his power. That brings up another question, how much steam does it take to conduct his power? What about water in the air? I'm guessing normally it wouldn't be enough, but during a storm where there's already lots of rain?

5.  The heater/shaper violates conservation of energy, which means he can produce infinite electricity. It's probably not very useful in a fight, but he needs a good reason to not be working in a power plant. A coal plant uses millions of tons per year, so even if he was being paid millions of dollars it would still be far cheaper to hire the heater than to buy coal. The transmuter can /probably/ find a way to abuse his power as well, but I don't know enough chemistry to give you specifics.

6.  The heater can start fires. Probably not very useful but might not be obvious since usually water = no fire.

7.  The biggest limitation to the trident is the water. The heater and transmuter are effectively destroying water, so in a prolonged fight they'll eventually run out of fuel. The shaper can bring large quantities of water with him to delay this (have it levitate above them so it stays out of the way). A well suited tactic would be hit and run style attacks. Bring in water, use it, then get out as supplies fall off to grab more. Alternatively, you can fight by underground water pipes/lakes/rivers/etc. Or during a storm.

8.  The shaper can destroy buildings by targeting the water pipes.

9.  The shaper can suffocate people.

10. The shaper should prepare for fights by making everything wet. This gives the team an ideal environment.

11. The shaper can pick locks, or the transmuter can just dissolve them. If the door uses a digital lock, then you can dissolve the physical bars that hold the door shut. Same idea for chains, shackles, etc.

12. The heater and transmuter can set up booby traps with a puddle of water wired back to them.

13. The transmuter can dispose of evidence by melting it.

14. The transmuter can fill glass/ceramic containers with acid and use them as grenades.

15. The shaper can bombard an enemy position with the transmuter's acid bombs, or anything else that's handy.

16. The heater can create fog to obscure a getaway. It wouldn't last for long though.

17. Steam trains. Not a literal train, but the method for turning water into force... though it probably wouldn't be very good here since the heater has to touch the initial water.

18. Use transmuted acid to melt a hole in the floor for a quick escape -- or set up a ring of water for a trap.

19. The shaper can clobber people with wire-linked water balls. He can also smash stuff, like cars, buildings, etc.

20. The shaper can accelerate himself and water to high speed. Tweak the angle of the water so it'll strike something while the shaper himself flies past safely and you've got a nasty weapon. Might not seem dangerous, but consider that if you're moving fast enough and hit the ocean, it'll feel like concrete. Terminal velocity for a skydiver is about 120mph, only slightly more than the shaper's max velocity. You can also combo this with the transmuter. Alternatively, you can do the same thing with rocks and dirt. Or, you can go for a good old rods from god and just levitate a big chunk of iron and drop it. This is different from #15 because the velocity involved is /much/ higher, but the precision is also worse. You'll have a lot of collateral damage with a kinetic strike.

21. Everyone should carry around water, in case they get separated from the shaper. Normal water bottles are pretty awkward, but there's flat flasks and such meant to be strapped to your body for easier use. They have less volume, but that's fine, if you're desperate a little water can go a long way.

22. Not a tactic, but acid usually reacts badly with water. It's a basic safety rule for chemists and if the transmuter is slinging around acid in a wet environment it's probably going to end badly.

****** When you said microscope I assumed you meant an electronic one, my mistake. If it is just glass then he would absolutely be able to manipulate water on the other side.

As for your other question, any amount of moisture in the air is theoretically enough to conduct his power though the strength of his attacks obviously varies.

And about that power plant idea, funnily enough that is actually apart of his backstory. He was so good at his job that he put a lot of people out of business who against better judgement wanted to get revenge which led to some people being exploded and him having to turn to less than official pursuits. In the Shapers case his father(who has the same power) saved his home country of Japan from many potentially devastating tsunami's and other natural disasters as well as working in Hydro-power. His son however was obsessed with mythological stories about ancient elemental water gods from cultures around the world and believed that his father was wasting his potential as a public servant. He wanted to be feared, and respected, treated as being more than human which he truly believed.

Sorry if that was too much backstory, thank you so much for your advice and ideas. I've always loved the idea of using such powers in unconventional or novel ways and you have given me lots to think about!

******** Thank you, I've always loved the superhero genre type of stuff but thought that in general the whole thing was a little too constrained to certain ideas and tropes. Like what you mentioned earlier in that the vast majority of people with abilities like this would probably use them in completely mundane ways instead of fighting each other.

At the same time however, I also love outrageous super-powered punch ups.

There are a lot of other details such as super technology courtesy of abnormally intelligent individuals becoming integrated into global society during the 1950's and the fact that the main plot takes place in a retro future 1970's.

** Ok, Iskeia (from another world) novels. Their is a system but it gives you a clearly defined amount of time to prepare yourself for transport to this world. I have been thinking about 3 days, but I would also like to see how much things change when you have 1 month, 1 year or 10 years to prepare.

You have no idea what type of world this will be, what setting or even what you would be able to keep if anything. Magic may or may not be real.

What you do know is that the system works for you right now. It allows you to Skill Up in multiple disciplinarians.

Skill Ups do the full,"flood your mind with extra information after you level" the relevant Skill. At least to start you do not know how the system works. It could end with all skills at 10 or go to 100, or even infinite. It is 100 though, just that your person does not know that so you will have to test that in a somewhat efficient way.

Skills can basically be anything. You do not retroactively get skills from your previous learning.

Compound Bows 100 just means you are really good at knowing where it will land. It is not a magical sense of knowing where it will land just a good idea. Bow 100 does not know how to shoot multiple arrows at once.That would be a separate skill Multiple Shot #.

You can not learn magic on this Earth. You still do not know if magic exists on the other world either. So no learning Elemental Arrow # or Heraculun Strength #. This is another thing you do not know because the System does not tell you.

The best archer throughout history would probably have bows 90-95 on a good day. Most likely said archer's ability would fluctuate to lower 70's to mid 80's.

With the system (again something that is not explicitly told to you) you do not have this problem. You will always shoot at Bow 100 when you have the skill at 100.

A subsequent skill could be heavy/variant winds arrow skill #. Also Bow Mastery # would not be a damage boost with bows but instead the speed that it takes you to learn a new bow.

Skills level up consistently. 1 hour = Skill Up. This is no matter the level. 99 -> 100 and 0 -> 1 are both 1 hour. This gets a little tricky in leveling up in things like dodge where you would not be dodging for a full hour instead you would be thinking about dodging for a full hour.

If you were practicing swords (or my choice Axe) then while practicing you would just dodge while swinging your weapon. It does not make you take 2 hours to learn both Dodge # and Swing #. It still takes 1 hour.

So how would you munchkin your time for 3 days 1 month 1 year or 10 years?

*** First things first: converting "prep time" into skill points. 3 days is 72 hours with no sleep or 24 with 8hrs per night. 1 moth is 256 hours 'night and weekends' or 360 'full time', and one year is 3328 hours night and weekends or 4380 full time. Since you can probably pull at least one all nighter but two is unwise I'm calling /3 days: 62 skill/ points. being generous I'm assuming two weeks vacation and the remainder night and weekends for /one month which is 296 skill points/. And for a /year I'm calling it an arbitrary 3000 skill points/ on the basis that a whole year is a long time to remain dedicated to one specific thing with no lapses in motivation or unavoidable complications. 10 years I think would be impractical to min/max as at that point you're going to have to spend most of your time living your regular life.

​

First observation:

​

3 days in insufficient to determine the skill cap, so you probably only get one main skill if you're trying to min/max. A month gets you up to 3 skills at expert level and pretty good confirmation about the cap. A year is enough to verify the cap, then devise a specific plan, max several skills and dabble in various other skills.

​

​

Second observation:

​

Without knowing what the world you're going to is like it's hard to value skills. If you level axes the find out this world is Star Wars like you'll feel stupid for not leveling guns or swords instead. If you level Chemistry but the world has alien space bats that don't like gunpowder who veto your skill well that will suck majorly. Especially if you got 3 days and that as the skill you focused on.

​

​

Third observation:

​

It may be possible to determine some things about the world based on what skills you get. For example whether the skill you get when working with basic lab procedures and equipment is called "Chemistry" or "Alchemy" will imply some things about what you might want to focus on.

​

​

Personal Strategy:

​

I'd pick two skills that I want to focus on initially. One will be "safe" (unlikely to be lost, likely to be valuable in any world) and the otehr "high risk" (chosen assuming best case scenario on its potential utility). I'll then try to level them as equally as I can until I reach the skill cap. Then I'll take stock of what if any skills i've picked up be accident along the way (I expect Cooking will slip in from preparing food for example) and either increase the ones I like the sound of, or formulate a new plan based on anything I notice about the names.

​

I think my initial skill pics would be something related to languages for the 'safe' skill. As I expect the world I currently inhabit to be pretty high up on quality of resources for learning about language and related topics like cryptography in general, and it's hard to make talking to people not a valuable skill. The main thing to worry about is getting stuck with specific languages that may not exist on the otehr world, but I expect I can abort if my first several attempts end up with "+1 level Chinese, +1 level ancient Myan, +1 level 1337" instead of something more like "+1 level Speak languages, +1 level decipher script, etc.". And for my High risk skill "SCIENCE!" (ideally including the caps and the exclamation point), But the specifics will depend on what feedback I get as I begin getting level ups.

​

​

I wouldn't bother with anything combat, wilderness survival, etc. focused unless I have a year or more as they're too dependent on what the world I end up on is like, and anything I can do in a month is going to be chump stuff compared to what somone who's been leveling their whole life can manage and "the graveyards are full of middleng swordsmen, better to be no swordsman at all than a middling one".

**** I choose ax because of the retaliative ease at making an ax using stones and wood. The difference between Chemistry and alchemy may only be in weather the ingredients are magical in nature or not and if that is the case, then the third observation would not be that informative.

But I like your ideas. Would you use any time on buying equipment in the off chance that you do get to keep it? what would you get?

***** I disagree about Alchemy vs Chemistry. That magic exists to be included in ingredients is significant knowledge that I was not otherwise given by the system. However more importantly that was an example. The core principle is that if I can catch the system interpreting a general action as training for a specific thing I can extrapolate that the specific thing is the main use of the general activity in this world. That can give me information about the new world the system is otehrwise not providing.

​

Some otehr examples:

If meditating gets me: "Force use" I may promote "swords" on my priority list as my estimate of the likelihood that this world has Jedi increases as I didn't instead get "Manna manipulation", "Occultism", "Mysticism", "Meditation", "Focus ki", etc.

​

If studding Physics gets me: "SCIENCE!" rather than "Physics", or "Mechanics", or "Motion" I would conclude the world I'm going to doesn't have a well developed scientific tradition. I'd also be included to suspect from the capitalization that it's going to become increasingly "mad science" as I level it.

​

If studying dragons gets me: "Beast Tamer" Well that's a jackpot of knowledge. I've established that monsters likely exist, that they can be tamed, and that I can level it by studying fictional creatures in this world.

​

In my specific strategy in particular the plan for the languages skill relys on this as I'm aiming for a skillset that lets me Daniel Jackson my way around problems and I'll need to adapt my study methods in response to what i actually get, possibly abandoning the skill in favor of something safer.

​

Making a passable Ax out of stone isn't particularly easy. You'd at least need some practice at stone knapping, which would then be something of a dead end skill unless you're going to a stone age world.

****** My thoughts about the ax (and yes you would need stone knapping) is that If you do not appear naked and thus keep your metal ax then you can keep using that skill. If you do appear naked then you have an immediate goal to make a stone ax and have a weapon.

If you appear in your doppelganger body with a flood of new information from your past/side self then you could drop ax and just never use it.

on your other points it is a good idea to test the new world IF that is how the system works. It could work by giving you skills based on how you understand them and thus you would only have Earth/English based skills like meditation and chemistry. where you would only otherwise unlock alchemy and manna manipulation once you arrive at the world with magic.

I say this because the only real inference you can make when you get the system is that it is an uber-powerful pseudo (maybe) all knowing system that may be either a magic god or a super tech AI.

If the system is smart enough to know how to systematize all forms of knowledge (like most of these systems in these books) It is probably smart enough to separate meditation from manna rotation.

I am not trying to say that this is not a good test to do, what I am trying to say is that I do not know why the system would be intelligent/powerful enough to reach earth and speak in English but not separate muggle science (chemistry) from wizard magic (alchemy).

I always think of these Isekiea systems novels with no separation between chemistry and alchemy have a major plot hole when it comes from a system that is at least partially aware of the MCs home-world.

******* The thing about the ax is that while axes are a good pick if you have to take a weapon skill, I'm just not seeing weapon skills in general being a good pick when you don't know anything about the state of weapons, armor, magic, and tactics on the otehr world.

And while accounting for the Skyclad Sorceress opening (nakend in the wilderness) in your plans isn't a bad idea, I think there are probably better skills to accomplish that goal. An ax is useful but not necessary for survival, and using axes isn't that complicated, so if you put one on your belt and get to keep it it's not like you'll cut your own hands off when you try to take some branches off a log to to make your shelter better.

On reverse engineering the system: Well, I'll admit, that most Isekiea stories operate on author fiat so it's possible the scientific methods doesn't work here. However, this is [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and and since such a world is intrinsically not rational, I'm ignoring that possibility for the purposes of this conversation.

If the world and the system follow rules, it should be possible to determine those rules by experimentation, and that means for the longer times at least you really should be experimenting and trying to determine those rules. If you have a year, spending 6 moths just tinkering with the system then formulating a plan based on the results of that tinkering is almost guaranteed to be better than formulating a plan at the start when you have no information and sticking to it for a full year. With 10 years you get even more time to experiment.

And on separation of chemistry and alchemy, Honestly it's not all that weird. A lot of the equipment and lab practices in modern chemistry were developed by alchemists, and if it wasn't for the fact that the underlying theory of matter turned out to be wrong, alchemy would have probably become a real science with the invention of the scientific method. If alchemy worked we wouldn't have chemistry, but a chemist walking into an alchemy lab will recognize most of the equipment and doing chemistry on a world where alchemy works will probably result in falsifying the laws of chemistry and verifying the laws of alchemy.

*** A bit late to post but I would get lots of mind related skills like memory palace, lucid dreaming, poly-plastic sleep, speed reading, memorization, comprehension etc After that if there is still time some martial arts at average level would do wonders for survivalist in a world where people rely on si-fi/magic. Probably some levels in wilderness survival too.

** Not sure if this is late enough to get buried, but wanted to write it up before I forget. This "power" is from [[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/zhang_12_18/][/Master Zhao: The Tale of an Ordinary Time Traveler/]], a great story I found on the Clarkesworld podcast. You can read or listen to it at that link. It's pretty long, but well worth the read. This post obviously has some spoilers for the story, but I'll do my best to keep it to mechanics to preserve the plot.

You have the ability to live through projected versions of the future. At various points in your life, you diverge from "primary" reality and begin living in an alternate timeline. The alter ends when you die or when certain irreversible choices are made, at which point you are returned to a point soon after--not simultaneous with--the moment you split off.

Three caveats make this less of a blessing than a curse. (The third is a heavy spoiler, so read the story first!)

One: you have no way of telling that you have split off into an alter until you return to the main timeline. Generally big choices spur a change, but there is no indication of divergence until you are deposited back in the primary, all memories of your alternate life intact.

Two: the longer you spend in an alter, the bigger the gap between divergence and return. If you spend 3 days on a split timeline, you might return a minute after you left; 20 years on an alter deposits you 3 weeks after the divergence. Nobody notices any difference in your behavior during that "empty" time, and you have no idea who--if anyone--is piloting you through the gap.

Three: As time goes on, the magnitude of choice that forces a split gets smaller and smaller: at first it's "do I save my son or my daughter," then "do I move to Virginia or New Hampshire," then "do I take the promotion or the bigger raise," then "do I buy the grey shirt or the blue shirt," then "do I get up at 8am or sleep for 5 more minutes." After a few decades of living with this ability, each day in the primary timeline takes subjective years or decades to get through, spinning off dozens or hundreds of alters. Caveat Two is mitigated by experience: the amount of "empty" time per second of alter decreases with use, until you can live years in an alter and come back seconds after you left. Master Zhao refers to himself as "Zeno's time traveler."

How would you go about making this power as useful as possible? Obviously memorizing a daily or weekly list of stock trends and lottery numbers would lend itself to getting rich quick, but beyond that, what do you do to maximize your own CEV (and if you're a big-time altruist, the world's CEV)? More immediately, what do you do to make sure that Caveat Three doesn't drive you insane?
