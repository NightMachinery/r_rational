** Did the planning in this chapter strike anyone as particularly irrational?

- the ranger tells them they're not ready, and they immediately discount him without any thought

- they don't seem to have any discussion about Absol's abilities and take the first conclusion (superstition) without exploring any alternatives or asking other trainers

- they seem to have an overwhelming type and strength advantage versus the diglett team but it still seems like a fight that was on the edge between going ok and going poorly

- the only decent planning they have is baiting the Absol with the meat, but they immediately rush in and abandon that plan without even waiting for it to work, leaving them to battle the Absol straight up

- no disaster/failure planning at all?

Did these discussions just happen off screen with no hints at them? It seems to go against what the team was just learning about at the gyms. Maybe that info will show up in the next chapter or after the battle.

It seems like something they shouldn't be so caught off guard by if they did their research. Although I also think I was primed for that interpretation. The conversation with the rangers makes them seem like a group of underprepared glory seekers. They seem more concerned with being the ones to catch the Absol than with being helpful, and the reasons they give why they can do it don't seem nearly as well articulated or substantial as the ranger's reasons why they can't. As much as Blue says it isn't about pride, it reads as though it is, and I wasn't expecting it to go well.

Out of curiosity, what from the text gives you this impression? Is it just a narrative convention you feel was set up from the chapter, or is there something specific? I feel like I may have written something poorly if readers are having this takeaway.

******** I think a mixture of both. We see that only Elaine has experience with tunnels (and then not much), and the ranger thinks only Glen is equipped to deal with the absol. No one person has both skills, and half the team has neither. It's sort of a Chesterton's fence thing, where even though the Rangers' advice isn't binding in this instance, I would expect a strong reason not to follow it, and what we see doesn't qualify for me. I don't think they really address the rangers' concerns about whether or not they qualify to get involved as they would like, and so I expect failure. We see them get started, and I'm primed to see bad decision making. Blue even gets clawed in the very first diglett encounter, which doesn't bode well. We see some ideas for preparation, but it's stuff they didn't prepare to do, like standing on container boxes. But this is all background stuff that just colors how I look at it.

Most importantly is how the chapter ends. With how uncertain Blue seems and how he has to figure out what's going on, it doesn't seem anticipated by the characters, and I don't really anticipate it either. So when it says the diglett are coming, it seems like an epiphany, a revelation, like no one realized the diglett were going to react this way. Which is very dramatic at first, but then it's like what?

********* Got it, thanks! My confusion was mostly centered around the idea that the diglett take them by surprise, since as you said, the chapter ends with Blue recognizing that he hears diglett coming, so there was no moment of actually showing their reaction to the diglett :) I understand from a narrative perspective why it builds up that way, and obviously used that as part of the revelation for the readers.

*** These are some excellent points, and without spoiling anything I can only say that 2/5 of them actually have hints in the chapter about things that will address them!

Well, 2/3 I should say, after answering these:

#+begin_quote
  they seem to have an overwhelming type and strength advantage versus the diglett team but it still seems like a fight that was on the edge between going ok and going poorly
#+end_quote

Yeah, as [[/u/ketura]] says, type advantage only goes so far in this world, where other factors like how outnumbered you are and the terrain and "invisible levels" can also sway the battles.

#+begin_quote
  the only decent planning they have is baiting the Absol with the meat, but they immediately rush in and abandon that plan without even waiting for it to work, leaving them to battle the Absol straight up
#+end_quote

I may not have made this clear, but they thought when the absol stopped responding that it had eaten the meat and fallen asleep, when in truth it basically stopped eating it as soon as it tasted something off :)

*** What I noticed was before they got to Golden Hills, they were actually planning pretty well, considering risk/rewards on taking the shorter route, etc.

I would bet that there really is something to Absol's bad luck field, since their really cocky arrogant moves started once they got near by, even before the party was right up next to it. Absol does have access to Perish Song at high levels, which could be some sort of probability collapsing effect that manifests as "Bad Luck".

I actually called this adventure going bad last month. I was partially kidding when I said that Blue would descend into a spiral of hatred due to everybody here dying, but it was well foreshadowned that it would not go as smoothly as Blue expected.

*** The types thing shouldn't be that big of a surprise. Typing is super important in a situation where essentially all else is equal (prowess, strategy, etc) but strikes me as an edge rather than the meat of a fight, especially when fighting wild groups.

Besides that, all fights are a toss up when your opponent only knows to try and gang up and murder you, type advantage or no. In this world, it looks like fighting Earthbending moles in a tunnel of their own make is straight up always going to be difficult, nearly regardless of what you bring to that fight.

** So, my previous prediction that this would go horribly wrong and end up in terrible trauma for everyone involved seems to not have been so far fetched. Fighting a obviously higher level fast sweeper plus a bunch of digletts and maybe some dugtrio while deep inside a maze-like tunnel is bound to be trouble.

The lack of Red and Leaf is showing. The group is obviously underprepared for this expedition. Taking a day to practice cave-delving and fighting digletts would be the correct course here. Ya, maybe you lose the absol, but you also probably won't face death risks. Furthermore, what if there was more than one absol? Blasting mating calls could easily attract both, and fighting two absols would spell disaster to Blue's team.

I also see no reason to use tangela against absol when it is the only ground resist the whole group has. Elaine has a graveler that probably could tank some hits from absol and is pretty much ununsable against digletts. They also didn't diglett-proof this chamber, did they? Seems like an oversight, to not insulate yourself in the place you expect to be weakest in. It might spook the absol, but that would be better than facing this exact situation.

The absol may be weakened, but he also weakened most of the big shots in team. Machoke, Kemuri, Tangela and sandslash are bleeding. Maturin has recovered, but took some damage last fight nonetheless. That leaves the Lax as the big trump card against the digglets, but they cannot coordinate correctly behind the huggable giant until the absol is dealt with. I cannot see them surviving this without casualities.

** Another great chapter, as always!

Alright people, place your bets now on what will happen. Who will die and what Pokémon will fall in this conflict? I can't see Blue dying, or Akko at this point either, but the other two seem pretty expendable as far as moving the plot forward goes. They seem less like major characters than Blue or Akko, so if anyone is going, my money is on them. Then again, Mr. DaystarEld could pull a fast one on us and have Akko die when we thought she'd be a main character. Regardless, I'm confident that Blue won't die.

I'm betting at least 3-4 Pokémon will bite the bullet from the Mole attack.

I think at the very least Maturin and Blue are going to survive. If this story is going into Red x Blue, there has to be a reason for red to want to take hum down, and this is prime time for Blue to start changing. If that's the case, at least one of the red shirts bites the dust here. If the story isn't going there, I cannot see any humans dying unless renegades get involved.

It could of course be some sort of distress beacon, the ability to transmit a signal even deep underground isn't too far fetched compared to some of the other technology we've seen, indeed in the various games you could use the various map/phone/watch things just fine in caves.\\

** How's it going? I don't have a fanfic account so I figured I'd try and reach you here.

I love the story so far. Really look forward to it each month. I do have one complaint though.

I can't get passed one of the kids already having a snorlax. It just feels like snorlax should be one of the hardest to train/catch Pokémon in the world. Like if someone pulls out a snorlax everyone goes "oh shit" because they're so strong. And the wild ones should be extreme threats if they decide to go on the move. I mean I pretty much picture a two story tall bear. I mean as far as game data goes Snorlax is stronger than any starters and has the same overall stats as Gyarados. That's pretty strong. Just my two cents.

*** I hear you. Snorlax is indeed a big deal, and Blue did note how unusual it is for someone with just 3 badges to have one when he first finds out Glen does :) That said, it is on the younger side, so it's not at the height of its power. Also, Glen is the oldest among the group, at 16.

Glad you're enjoying the story despite that though!

*** I think in a world where even the NPCs have access to a (pay-to-win) GTS, it makes sense that a lot of rare, powerful Pokemon are more available than they would be to a game protagonist. Especially with dedicated breeding programs assisted by behavior-modifying technology found in Pokéballs.

I mean, it's completely possible to go online IRL and play through XY, oRaS, and uSuM with just about any Pokemon you want from the start thanks to online trading features.

******* I figured that if there is a baseline degree of, say, "Psychic particles" in everyone, and having more of them (or more control of them) makes you Psychic, then an absence makes you Dark. That means you have no particles to be manipulated by Psychics. An actively Dark entity might draw them in and cancel them out as an offensive technique most effective against Psychics.

But the chi flow from Fighters is drawn in by the same effect, but not being Psychic particles they can't cancel it out, and so suffer the intended effect. So a Fighting attack delivers more power against Dark types. But Psychic attacks can manipulate the chi flow in others as readily as their Psychic potential, which is why Psychic attacks are effective against Fighting types.

***** The rangers have a pretty signifigant incentive to not really admit there might be something to Absol's bad luck effect.

There jobs is protecting against Pokemon related dangers. If Absol can cause car accidents and stair tumbles, then every time people notice "something must be wrong" because a slightly unlikely but otherwise insignificant number of extra house fires happen in the same week, people will start blaming Absol, draining resources away from fighting "real" threats. So long as it is just superstition, Rangers can ignore it and not become traffic cops and paramedics (even if those incidents are /technically/ pokemon-caused)

That's probably part of the reason why the Rangers are officially unofficially dealing with the problem. Since an Absol actually is there, they know something should be done, but they can't make a whole big deal lest Absol-hunting becomes an undue burden on the Ranger organization.

** Another great chapter. These are always something wonderful to look forward to every month! (Would even like to look forward to them bi-weekly if that were possible... :P)

Though only a small note in the chapter, I hope Blue or Aiko manage to find and capture a Bronzor, if they survive the mole-stampede, as I would be interested to hear more of Red's thoughts on the artificial Pokemon and how they fit into his Origins quest.

I was wondering how you are treating the move sets of strong wild Pokémon? I know that there aren't really levels, so without the help of a Trainer, how do wild Pokémon learn more esoteric or complicated strategies (for example, an Absol with Future Sight). Maybe just age, or perhaps lesser or unwieldy version of a battle ready move?

** 1. Does poison/sleep powder / stun spore leave a scent? (Guess: yes)
2. Any reason a pokemon couldn't have multiple status effects?

Figured Mean Look rather than Pressure... by the way, which chapter discussed how does the capture mechanism works? IIRC they stored the pokemon as data, but the storage wasn't enough to store people, so people ended up being MissingNo.. but another question is if any ball could benefit from the new storage solution.. granted, market forces might prevent the new storage from improving PokeMart-issue capture technology, even if it's a more efficient one.

2) Nope, they can definitely have multiple effects in this, though realistically they start to lose meaning once you layer them on.

3) It's kind of spread out over multiple chapters rather than described in any one, but the basic idea is that humans can be stored as data, but something about the process damages intelligence in a way that is particularly noticeable in humans, so it was made illegal.
