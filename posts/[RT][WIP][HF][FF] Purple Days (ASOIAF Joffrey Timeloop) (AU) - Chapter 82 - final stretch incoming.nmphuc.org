For those unfamiliar with this story and who want to know what it's about so they can start [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][from the beginning]]*, Purple Days is a story that begins where canon Joffrey's story ends. This is a Joffrey who has done all of the nasty things you've seen Joffrey do, and has come to the fate that pretty much no one either in or out of universe (except Cersei) felt the least bit bad about.

And then everything goes purple, and he wakes up, and he has looped back to a few days after the beginning of the show/book, with the King and his entourage preparing to head north to Winterfell to name Eddard Stark Hand of the King. He tries to avenge his own death upon the person he thinks responsible, but that goes awry, and everything goes purple once again...

I'm not going to go into much detail, but this is a story where Joffrey starts out every bit as horrible a little shit as he was in the books, and even so, I feel the story does a good job of making him learn the lesson of how shitty a person he has been, to try to make amends and become a good person and a good king. Which would be an interesting story all on its own, but even if he could make friends with all of the people of Westeros who would have wished his old self dead, Daenerys still wants her father's throne back, the Army of the Dead is getting ready to march south, and he still has to solve the mystery of the purple force which keeps bringing him back to life...

I give this a solid recommend, both as a story in general, and as a rational tale where Joffrey spends most of the story learning (and exploring parts of Martin's world that the books and show haven't visited). If you haven't been reading it, now is a good time to start, as I doubt you'll make it past the Yi Ti arc** before it ends. If you have, then buckle up, because it looks like the last few chapters are incoming.

* As a warning, the events of the prologue have been retconned out of existence; the story proper starts after the line "I remembered my second life."\\
** Edit to add: Okay, Yi Ti isn't /that/ long, it's only about 10 chapters, but it feels a lot longer because of the abrupt change of pace it represents.


** I'll second the recommendation. It's one of the best story I discovered through this sub. The character development is really well done, I've rarely seen a story that is able to take such a hateful character and turn him into someone completely different while still making the progression feel natural. Joffrey and the other characters rarely hold the idiot ball and make rational decisions based on what they know (well except at the beginning when Joffrey is literally an idiot)

Side note: A lot of people hate the Yi Ti arc but I actually really liked it because of the added world building.

*** I don't hate the Yi Ti arc. It's necessary for character development, it gives Joffrey a lot of ideas about how to run a Kingdom and an army that he'll need later, and it's the first real exploration of what will become the main plot of the story. My problem with it is that I think it isn't set up properly in terms of pacing or tone. If I went into it expecting that Joffrey would be spending the next ten chapters brutally learning what's at stake in the upcoming war against the dead, rather than thinking that it'd be more like previous loops, I would probably have enjoyed it more.

**** Yeah, I felt like I started the last half of the arc expecting each chapter to be the final chapter, given the scale of the threat. Its a good arc for driving home Joffrey's drive to keep on going, how he doesn't want to lose people (as he knows them), and how everyone else doesn't have that "retry" of the loop as an option in their lives and plans. The events and themes of the arc work well, it was just hard to see the scope in the moment of first reading it and is better on a reread.

** My favorite thing about this story is I can pretend that GoT 1-4 is the prequel series for it while ignoring the nonsense in the final seasons

Well that and the part where it's really really good and honestly one of my favorite pieces of fiction. Looking forward to seeing how it ends.

** I gotta say, the decision to basically load Joffrey with so much torture he thinks he is in hell was a good one; it's hard to stay mad at him, despite how bad he was in the original canon, after all that. Watching him make the kind of mistakes I'd expect before while slowly, slowly learning his lessons was a good way to endear him to the reader. Matching his learning with his growing recognition of just how horrible a person he'd been before helps the plot stay grounded in the source material.

I'm only just starting the Yi Ti arc, but I really enjoyed the lifetime with the lemons and the Broken Knights. Clegane, Jon, and Tyrion all deserved a bit of camaraderie and laughter.

***** The first two don't work but the second two do. Think it's because there are mistakes in the way some of the tags are spaced around sentences. They need to be =>!like this!<= and not =>! like this !<=
