Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I was waitlisted by MIT this Wednesday. Despite all my preparation, I think I made a couple of major mistakes during the interview. In retrospect, the business school application process has been very disappointing. I don't think I've ever tried this hard at anything and failed.

Now I need to decide if I want to apply to other top tier bschools outside the Boston area, wait a year and retry, or just attend law school. Because I took the shotgun approach and applied to law schools too.

In slightly happier news, I took the LSAT for the third time and scored the same as the girl from Legally Blonde, which means I have a fighting chance at Harvard Law.

But, I have 11 days off, so that's nice. Might end up coming back to the previous place as a normal employee later, if their procurement works out. It's an odd feeling.

**** My particular company doesn't do a ton of travel, so I don't need to worry about that. For a consultant, two years is a really long term assignment, so you'll generally be swapping projects more frequently than that. Depending on the place and your level of experience you could be doing anything from just being an extra hand on the project, to full managed delivery either on your own or in a team, to making recommendations for how the larger organization can manage a team or project more effectively. It's such a broad title that your experiences can vary incredibly massively between companies, so I would focus more on the specifics of the role you're looking at than on consulting in general.

** You know, I thought about it a few weeks ago, and it still seems true: French president Emmanuel Macron (and /La Republique en Marche/ in general) is the real-life incarnation of a MoR!Harry Potter as a politician; like, he's exactly what you get when you get what we think of as a rationalist character elected IRL.

- Younger than all his predecessors in living memory, and known for hiring younger staff than average? Check.

- Rose from relative obscurity to President of the Republic in less than 5 years? Check.

- Has a core following whose loyalty is described as almost cult-like? Check. (although you can say the same about Melenchon)

- Changes a shit-ton of decades-old systems, that lots of people agreed were obsolete, but politicians thought would be too controversial to touch? Check.

- Kind of bad at public speeches, everyone agrees he's kind of stilted, and yet very charismatic in private meetings and good at convincing people one-on-one? Check.

- Even people who support him think he's arrogant and should get better at presenting his views? You bet.

- Acts like everybody would agree with him if he could just get them to sit around a table and explain why his ideas are the best? Oh my, check. (It's becoming almost memetic how much some sections of the French electorate are sick of hearing the word "pedagogy", and yet the government keeps using it anyway)

Also, not exactly a rationalist trait, but his wife is 20 years older than him, and they met in a theater class when he was 15 yo, which his supporters kind of try not to bring up, and his opponents /love/ to bring up.

I don't really have a deeper point to make, it just seemed like a fun connection.

I misread this as "20 years /younger/ than him" the first time, and proceeded to be confused over how he could have met his wife in a theater class five years before she was born.

Makes me wonder about a universe where time travel is possible, but it's politically embarrassing to be married to a time traveler.

**** I'm still trying to make myself an informed opinion, honestly. Like, seriously, sometimes I spend hours reading Wikipedia articles about what he did and I still don't know whether I should agree with it. It's terrifying.

My uninformed opinion is that, at least aesthetically, I really like him. He's a reformist, which this country definitely needs. He's trans-partisan, or at least tries to be, which essentially boils down to "every other party hates him". In some ways, he's like a Donald Trump that doesn't go "Let's piss off a foreign country on Twitter for no reason" every so often. He says what he thinks, which is a trait I value in a politician, even if he gets a ton of shit for it sometimes. He's very candid and self-critical in situations where previous presidents would have pretended that everything was going great.

There's something in his speeches sometimes that makes me want to believe in him, that maybe his government can pull through, give our country non-suicidal economic policies, start paying back our national debt, etc, without feeding the vicious cycle of government after government getting put up and torn down by angry mobs that expect their leaders to magically lower taxes and increase social aids at the same time to fix every problem. He also seems to believe in a coherent Europe with working trade and immigration policies that doesn't force its members to be in a permanent state of open borders, and in working with the OCDE to stop tax optimization by multinationals (especially GAFAs).

Regarding his actual policies, it's pretty hard to tell whether any decision is good or bad. Replacing the ISF by the ISI is super unpopular, but I think it's a sound decision? I have no idea whether lowering housing benefits makes sense or not. The /Montagne d'Or/ seems legit (or at least, as legit as a mining project can be). He liberalized French railways, which ended a century-old special status for train conductors, which I /think/ makes sense? Not sure what else it involves. He set up laws to forbid cumulative mandates, which has been a long time coming, and stricter supervision of campaign finances.

Overall, he just seems like he knows what he's doing, and a lot of his critics just... don't. A lot of the scandals he's involved in or the controversial decisions he took, just seem to me like him honestly trying something new, and getting shit from actors that are just looking for reasons to tear him down (because he represents the economic establishment, because he's a liberal, because he's unpredictable).

tl;dr I kinda like him.

I feel like regular citizens really /shouldn't/ be able to fully comprehend all the ramifications of a policy choice made by anyone playing the game of statesmanship at a high-enough level.† If they can, it's a sign that the politician is too busy pandering or signalling to optimize for the long-term well-being of their country, and so has chosen a policy that is obviously of benefit to nobody, rather than one that's just mysterious in exactly who it benefits.

† E.g. doing things like gathering intelligence about the secret failures of another nation's operations against your citizens to use as leverage in any negotiations with them, only to sit on that knowledge during the actual negotiation, content in the knowledge that they will /assume/ that you know about their screw-ups, since you've pulled out such intelligence before---meaning that that failure is still being used as leverage, but is never put on-the-record for the citizenry of either country.

*** I double majored in English and Computer Information Science, and took two writing classes as part of that.

My experience was that they were /okay/, but probably wouldn't have been worth the money if I had been paying anything to go to college (scholarships). The primary thing that academics offer are 1) a structured approach to learning that might be better for some people's learning styles and 2) fellow travelers who are doing the same things as you and are available to engage with on things that have some consequences for failure and 3) trained professionals who can offer advice, insight, and guidance.

It's great to have someone you can go to and say, "Hey, read this and tell me what you think" and you don't have to worry so much that they're going to give you incompetent advice, flake out, or turn you down. That's actually pretty hard to get, if you want to cobble together a writing education from pieces. /Ideally/ your professor or instructor will know a thing or two about the subject they teach, or be an author themselves (preferably published, preferably something that you've read and appreciated, if not liked), and that's a good resource to lean on that you might have trouble finding elsewhere. It's also great to be able to build up that relationship with someone who's passionate about the same thing you are, whether that's your instructor or fellow students. Again, replicable elsewhere, just kind of hard to find organically, because so many people flake out.

That said, the most important thing for developing writing skill is to write every day, which sounds simple and stupid, and /is/ simple and stupid, but still works better than almost anything else that anyone will try to sell you.

** After taking up parkour for two years (thanks [[/u/TK17Studios][u/TK17Studios]]), and at the request of one of the coachs, I've finally watched /District 13/ and /Yamakazis/.

Aaaaaand they're pretty good!

--------------

/Banlieue 13/ is basically /Escape from New York/ in Paris suburbs. In the far-away, dystopian future of 2010 (the movie is from 2004), crime has risen so high that Paris' suburbs have been quarantined and surrounded by giant prison walls (presumably not /all/ suburbs, or else I don't see how people would go to La Défense, but anyway). So these districts have become lawless ghettos where crime and poverty is everywhere, the strongest rules and the weakest pay rent, etc.

The government has lost a guided nuclear missile, its convoy having been intercepted in District 13, the most dangerous of all districts. An elite police officer must associate with a heroic street rat to find and disarm the bomb before it blows the whole District up. They're at odds at first because the officer is a little uptight and the street rat doesn't trust cops, but they develop a bond and must come together at the end to save the day.

So, it's essentially fight scenes, and a lot of parkour scenes, with very little SFX (no wires or greenscreens). The scenario is simplistic, but works well enough, and the actors manage to deliver a ton of emotion and personality in their interactions. I especially liked the mob boss's death scene.

The political aspects are a little on the nose sometimes; it's clearly a Luc Besson movie. Like, guys, I've seen you lived in a ghetto surrounded by 100m high walls, I've seen the cops with assault rifles, I don't need you to /explicitly tell me/ "Yeah, the government doesn't care about us, it sees us as criminals to keep locked in a cage!". Same thing for the cop. I've seen he was serious, I've seen he fought crime, I don't need him to lay out his entire philosophy between two actions scenes, especially when it's just "I fight for law and order because we're nothing without law! I don't fight for my corrupt superiors, I fight for the ideals of justice and equality that the law represents!". I mean, thanks for saying all that out loud, it would have been a shame to let me understand the movie's message by myself. :P

The main character is played by David Belle, one of the tracers that popularized parkour as a sport in the 90s.

(fair warning, the only relevant female character in this movie is played by a former porn star and gets taken as a sex slave near the beginning, and basically becomes irrelevant except as a motivator for the hero; it /is/ a Luc Besson movie; it's too bad, I really liked her performance and thought she was one of the actors that put the most emotion into her role)

--------------

/Yamakazis/ is a little less exciting. It's more grounded, and feels like a story that /might/ just have happened to the Yamakazis in the 90s.

For those wondering, the Yamakazis are the /other/ group of tracers that popularized parkour in France. As I understand it, they were a group of friends training together that formed an official outreach group in 1997, and featured in a few documentaries and movies since, including /Yamakazis/ in 2001.

(also, the founder, Charles Perrière, is my parkour coach, which is super cool)

The synopsis is fairly simple: after a kid gets a heart attack trying to imitate the Yamakazis' antics, he needs a heart transplant. The only available is a Switzerland, and thus can't be reimbursed by social security. The Yamakazis get mad at the hospital's director, who tells them he won't perform the operation if he doesn't get the money. They decide to steal the money from the hospital's directors in a series of burglaries to pay for the operation.

The movie is even more Luc-Besson-ish, with cops who are all various shades of stupid, racist and corrupt, the one with the heart of gold gives his demission at the end of the movie, all the rich people they rob are snobby jerks, etc. Overall, while I really liked the action scenes, the political message of the movie left me a little uneasy. One of the last scenes, in particular, is the ex-cop having the hospital doctor pay 10'000 Francs from his own pocket, /at gunpoint/, to outbid another demander. I think that was supposed to be the director's comeuppance, but it just... left a bad taste in my mouth? The guy didn't do anything wrong, and it's not like there's anything heroic about raising a bid for an organ transplant; that just mean the other bidder won't be able to save /their/ kid.

Anyway, good movie overall.

**** Probably not, I just looked it up on Wikipedia. He kinda talks about the "pals" in vague terms, and I didn't really grill him on specifics. I don't know if David Belle had already left the group when they founded the Yamakazis.

He told us some about their training at the time, though. He says skinheads were a big problem in the suburbs at the time, and they all trained at a militaristic pace to be ready if and when fights broke out.

I don't think they thought about it in terms of "inventing" something. /Parcours du combatant/ had long been a part of military training, and I /think/ most of them had gone through mandatory military service. I think they just were all sport / martial art enthusiasts with common interests who trained together until it started to look like they could build a formal discipline out of it.
