** I think people forget what a shithole New York City was. 1990 was the peak in murders per year; there were 2245 compared to 328 last year, and that's with the population increasing by 15% in the interim. The same applies to violent crime, property crime, etc. This change didn't just happen in New York City, it happened all over the place, for reasons that are disputed. Most of the large companies that are currently headquartered in New York City were there during the early 1990s and late 1980s, when crime got real bad (including large financial companies, pharama companies, etc.). That was /also/ the period when the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families][Five Families]] start to get knocked around by RICO charges (Mafia Commission Trial dates to 1985) which I think eventually contributed to the drop in crime.

So I think that crime in Gotham isn't actually that difficult to swallow, if you assume that things happened a little differently there. Whatever factors you want to attribute to the reduction of crime just didn't occur. But that doesn't mean that you can't have enormous companies operating there either, because that's the scenario that New York City found itself in.

The other thing is that we have a severe sampling bias; obviously Batman goes where the crime is and the narrative follows him.

** I always figured Gotham is where the rest of the DC-US exports its toxic industries instead of DC-China. It's sort of an environmental free trade zone, and rich people like Wayne live there for the tax benefits.

** The crime wave of the seventies in our universe was almost certainly caused by leaded gasoline and the attendant negative effects on intelligence and personality. - Lead pollution knocks a few points of the average IQ and reduces impulse control on top of that - Which leads to lots more people failing at thinking the likely consequences of their actions through before embarking on a life of crime.

Riffing off this, I am going to blame Gotham and it's fucking weirdness on a similar environmental problem. in the 1920's an early Wayne, the founder of the Wayne industrial empire, discovered a very effective anti-oxidation steel coating. Very hard wearing, somewhat self-healing, a nice matte black, non-toxic. Huge commercial success. Unfortunately, while the Wayne coating itself was perfectly safe, the waste products from producing it include a compound with very interesting neurological effects.

And it got into the water. And the soil.

Primary: It's powerfully anti-akrasiatic. Gothamites do not slack off. It really, really, does not improve judgement, but the /average/ gothamite works insanely hard to make the most of themselves -

The primary job of fitness trainers in Gotham is to keep their clients from damaging themselves from overexertion, gothamite corporations put up with operating in a city with an endemic supervillain problem because the productivity of the local workforce is off the charts, and people stay in a city with an insane murder rate because the ability to work 40 hours per week, then go home and study / work out / ect for another 40 is very, very hard to give up.

Secondly, to a small subset of the population, it does more than this. Batman, and a very large number of his villains are all suffering from a similar toxin induced cognitive malfunction - Obsessed with costumes and a theme, high intelligence applied towards said obsession, extremely elevated pain treshhold, and so on and so forth.

Gotham also doesn't actually have that many more criminals than anywhere else, it's just because given that noone in Gotham is a slacker, none of the criminals Gotham does have are small time. Noone shoplifts - it's honest work or escalating all the way to a minimum of bank heists.

*** In the videogame Archam City (and probably other places throughout the franchise) they mention the existence of "Lazarus Pits" in the ruins below Gotham city. Because of their healing and literal anti-aging properties, Ra's al Ghul is known to use these pools to maintain his eternal youth, but they're also known to cause insanity and death in lesser men. It's very possible that this stuff is leaching into the Gotham water supply and having a significant effect on its citizens.
