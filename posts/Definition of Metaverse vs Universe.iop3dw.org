What is the definition of of Metaverse as opposed to Universe? I see the term metaverse used, e.g. in this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/il6aik/rational_fiction_and_the_butterfly_effect/g3so9it/][comment]].

According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse_(disambiguation)][wikipedia]] it is a Fictional universe, with multiple alternate timelines.

How do you define metaverse?


** Fictional universes(/multiverses) and their alternate timelines, I'm guessing. As an example, in Transformers, Transformers Prime, War for Cybertron, Fall of Cybertron, and The Covenant of Primus, a few other media, and their fanfics form a metaverse.

I think (emphasis on "I") it's also intransitive. HPMOR would be within the Harry Potter metaverse, but the main HP universe isn't in the HPMOR metaverse.

** for me, I would focus on the prefix. uni- meaning single, a universe is a single, enclosed space containing matter. in a literary sense, it is the stage where things happen in a story and would contain all the things related to that story.

meta- is less simple, meaning something transcending the base concept, existing on a higher level, or contemplating the nature of the base word. metacognition is thinking about thinking, for example. thus, to me, a metaverse is a container collecting similar or related universes. I would say that Harry Potter, the canon stories, would constitute a literary universe, but that plus all related fan fiction would be the Harry Potter metaverse. depending on your selection criteria, you could define an almost unlimited number of metaverses from this one - the HPMOR metaverse, for example. for me, the defining feature of a metaverse is that events in one story do not directly affect any other beyond being ancestors, descendants, or otherwise being inspiration for. I would suggest that stories which do affect one another in more direct ways could be better described as a shared universe (or a multiverse if they are mostly separate, but intersect occasionally though special circumstances).

again, all of this is my own personal head-canon, and may or may not intersect with commonly accepted definitions of the terms.

** In the comment, EY basically said that the universe hosting HPMOR is detached from the OG universe, so it shouldn't be expected to follow or rely on things that would or have applied for the canon story.

If I had to make an all encompassing definition by those standards, metaverse would be a universe detached from any and all factors that would influence narrative, as it pertains to other versions of the story.

Ie. In canon, John, Chris and Mary are a team of adventurers who fight monsters together, due to a childhood dream.

In metaverse A, Chris and Mary went the political route due to their childhoods being different from canon, and John, for one reason or another, is not in the picture.

In metaverse B, John and Mary are employees in a coffeeshop, Chris is a friendly regular. There are no monsters.

In metaverse C, John and Chris are werewolves. Mary is a doctor who helps them while keeping their secret.

In metaverse D, John, Chris and Mary are a team of adventurers who fight monsters with /technology/.

Point being, you can designate any metaverse to mean "informed by canon, but not influenced by it"

** It's probably a different sense than the one you're using and the one EY is using, but the term "metaverse" has [[https://www.cbr.com/doomsday-clock-superman-metaverse/][recently been used in the DC limited series "Doomsday Clock"]], to denote a specific universe within a multiverse, which has a disproportionate effect on the other universes within the multiverse.

In the Doomsday Clock event, the primary DC universe which we, the readers, have been observing through comics, is called a "metaverse" because all of the other universes seem to define themselves in reaction to that universe.

A similar concept is found in Steven King's /The Dark Tower/, where there are two "keystone" worlds (our Earth, and All-world where the Dark Tower itself lies) in which time only flows one way and things done are done permanently. The ending notwithstanding.
