I posted these reviews in [[/r/TiraasTGaB][r/TiraasTGaB]], but that sub is mostly dead, so I'm reposting them here to hopefully get some more interesting discussion.

/Here is my initial review from 1.15:/

I'm at 1-15, and I had to stop reading to laugh out loud at this part (when Tellwyrn gives Gabriel the coat):

#+begin_quote
  “Do you know what the buttons say?” he asked, fingering one.

  “Yes. From top to bottom: Beer, Honor, Family, Ham, Intelligence, and that last one is a kind of meat pastry they used to make in Svenheim that I don't think I've seen in a few decades. Dwarven runes were trendy a while back; humans often tacked them onto things without getting them translated. There is some truly embarrassing centennial architecture in Tiraas.”
#+end_quote

So far it's pretty interesting. The above passage notwithstanding, I feel like the author hasn't quite hit his stride with the humor (with some of the sexual humor being a bit too crude and juvenile), especially compared to the banter in Practical Guide to Evil or the witty narration of Unsong, for example, but it has been steadily improving.

I like that all the characters, especially Trissiny, have exhibited some serious flaws. I can tell they'll probably be a good team later, so I appreciate how organically they currently have trouble getting along. It can be hard to write conflict among future allies without it either not being believable, or having them dramatically change their characters.

I also like how the author has balanced the local plot of UU, the larger plot involving the Empire, Elilial, and the gods, and the history and world building of the setting.

I think it's safe to say I'm probably hooked at this point and intend to read the whole thing. I can keep writing periodic updates on my reactions if people are interested.

--------------

/Here is the latest review I just posted, through the end of Book 8:/

So judging by the amount I've read since I started 2 weeks ago, you can probably tell that I'm hooked.

The characters continue to grow on me and the magic system is totally fascinating, but I think my favorite part about the story is the amount of "fuck yeah!" moments and the captivating plot.

I also like that the author has proven that he can be trusted. What I mean by that is that so far, whenever characters act in a way that doesn't make sense, it's intentional, and is explained later on, usually by a totally unpredictable reason that comes completely out of left field, but makes perfect sense in retrospect.

I'm very interested in hearing more about Elilial's fall from grace and the events surrounding her getting kicked out of the Pantheon. I also like the new freshman class a lot and I enjoy the religious politics in Tiraas almost as much as the adventures of the university students. I'm glad that the main cast of students are all showing measurable character growth (I mentioned Trissany's flaws and their collective inability to get along in my first review- both of these have been satisfyingly addressed). Speaking of character development, it's interesting to learn more about Arachne and her past, and see her flaws exposed as she develops from basically a plot device to her own interesting character.

I only have a few negative comments (aside from the fact that the author hasn't corrected the typos people have pointed out in the comments). I'm a little bit concerned there may be too many "power-ups" or advantages given to the protagonists (e.g., Gabe at the end of Book 7 didn't really feel earned, since Vidius had barely been introduced and his selection of Gabe wasn't really foreshadowed or explained). I get that leveling up is a part of the D&D aspect of the world, but the threats they face need to scale up proportionate to their power levels, and their leveling up needs to be earned, or it runs the risk of getting into Mary Sue territory. Another danger zone is that some of the plot twists are just a little too unpredictable and run the risk of feeling contrived if they are impossible to predict and insufficiently foreshadowed. I don't think that's happened yet, but there have been one or two borderline ones (e.g., in the events surrounding Principia's departure from Last Rock, her extensive planning and manipulation is revealed after the fact, with no clues beforehand, and then the consequences of her explaining that out loud are also all part of her plan). The only other criticism I have is pretty minor, more of a nitpick really, but I sometimes find the front-loaded scenery descriptions to be a slog to read through, especially when I'm impatient to read the resolution of the latest cliff-hanger and the description is of some geography a hundred years in the past. I find that reading the character tags is a great help in those situations, because it gives some context for what I'm reading about and why I should care.

Overall, I think the story is great though, and I will be adding it to my standard list of web serial recommendations. It's entertaining as hell and the ensemble cast of characters are all unique and memorable. I'll probably post one or two more reviews as I make my way through and get caught up.


** In case you missed it, the mysterious stranger that talks with Gabriel a few times was Vidius in disguise. I didn't catch it when I initially read the story, but all the characters are listed at the top of the chapter page, so you should be able to look at where he appeared.

** Despite this series being somewhat contentious on this sub, I personally think it's a great read and I'm glad you're liking it too! Just some comments (hopefully avoiding any major spoilers) on a few parts of your review:

#+begin_quote
  I'm very interested in hearing more about Elilial's fall from grace and the events surrounding her getting kicked out of the Pantheon.
#+end_quote

Heh, you and everyone else! I think book 14 is finally getting close to explaining it, but unfortunately this overarching mystery is one that's still unsolved currently. Best guesses I've seen so far is that the gods somehow are hamstringing the mortal races for their own benefit, or that the coming "Great Doom" is going to involve a LOT of mass sacrifice/death and the Pantheon gods are OK with that.

#+begin_quote
  I also like the new freshman class a lot
#+end_quote

The new class is another divisive topic, and this is one where I side against the series. Yes, they're interesting characters in their own right... but it was incredibly frustrating to see the "main plot" get sidelined for so long. IMO they'd have been better as bonus chapters or a spin-off series.

#+begin_quote
  and I enjoy the religious politics in Tiraas almost as much as the adventures of the university students.
#+end_quote

Totally agree with you here. DD Webb has built a fantastic world and does a good job at showing how it's all interconnected. The sectarian conflict is one of my favorite parts.

#+begin_quote
  measurable character growth
#+end_quote

Yep, this is a running theme throughout the series. I think it's good that you've picked up on it, because the first few volumes felt like most of the characters had very similar voices (if that makes sense) and there was a lot more of stating what someone is than showing how. "Trissiny is a brilliant battlefield tactician" is just taken for granted early on, but later on we actually see her start to execute strategies that show what she's learned.

#+begin_quote
  Arachne and her past
#+end_quote

Speaking of things we're interested in learning more about... we do learn more about Arachne, but still haven't learned /specifically/ what her deal is/where she comes from. The stories about her past are awesome though. If you haven't read the bonus chapters yet, I recommend doing so (I think they can be read in any order, as they're flashbacks for the most part). Along Came A Spider and Scion are Arachne-focused.

#+begin_quote
  I'm a little bit concerned there may be too many "power-ups" or advantages given to the protagonists... it runs the risk of getting into Mary Sue territory.
#+end_quote

This is definitely a concern. I think what keeps the characters from becoming Mary Sues is that their flaws and weaknesses are also constantly brought up, and that even with their power boosts they still have plenty of opponents whom they cannot overpower: headhunters, Naiya's daughters, the gods themselves, and of course... bureaucracy and politicking. A running theme for the series is that no matter how powerful an individual may be they can't win indefinitely by themselves or on strength alone.

#+begin_quote
  Another danger zone is that some of the plot twists are just a little too unpredictable and run the risk of feeling contrived
#+end_quote

Yep. That's probably one of the main reasons this sub has split views on TGAB, because things happening "for the plot" is really frowned upon. I find the justification for this (which is basically that the gods are tweaking the odds behind the scenes) is less satisfying than other series like APGTE (where narrative effects is entirely woven into the plot) or WTC (where the world is built on tabletop game mechanics, revolves around "the player," and is overseen by a GM).

#+begin_quote
  I sometimes find the front-loaded scenery descriptions to be a slog to read through, especially when I'm impatient to read the resolution of the latest cliff-hanger and the description is of some geography a hundred years in the past.
#+end_quote

Eh, I like the robust descriptions because I think the world building is great and helps each place feel unique. That's key when there are dozens of places to visit. I couldn't tell you much about the cities in APGTE, or even name more than a couple; but I can tell you the difference between Tiraas, Tar'naris, Sarasio, Last Rock, Viridill, Puna Dara, and Veilgrad thanks to their descriptions. But the impatience for the plot to move on is something that I completely agree with you about.

My own criticism of the series would probably be:

- The characters' plot armor makes it difficult to feel like the stakes are actually high. Even when they lose, they don't lose catastrophically. I think only a handful of characters have died throughout the series, none of them higher than B or C listers.
- The story seems to swing between character development and plot development. The plot was established early on, but then character development reigns supreme with only occasional plot hints here and there until the more recent books. It's good to get to know the characters, but it makes progression overall a slooooow affair.
- The last two points combine to an additional problem: the cast of characters is HUGE, and just keeps growing. Even with all the time spent on fleshing them out it gets hard to keep them all straight, especially when you catch up and a character might only show up again several books (and thus months) later.
- The references to modern Earth entertained me at first, but eventually just made me cringe. The narrative justification for them is also REALLY weak. I can't imagine we're anywhere near close to terraforming a planet or obtaining immortality, but even if we were a hundred+ years down the road, there's absolutely no chance that those people would be into World of Warcraft or Cowboy Bebop, and almost a negligible chance that they're into Star Wars or Lord of the Rings (all of these get direct references in the series). Self-inserts can be handled well, but these were not.

Most of the other criticisms I had originally were smoothed out or addressed as the series progressed. Unfortunately I feel like some new readers will get turned off by the early books before they can get into it. It's a shame, because it's a series I keep up with as new updated come out. Glad you like it too, OP!

*** I've been reading the bonus chapters. The Along Came A Spider sections were actually what prompted my comment about Arachne.

#+begin_quote
  no matter how powerful an individual may be they can't win indefinitely by themselves or on strength alone.
#+end_quote

Arachne seems to get by on brute force fairly well so far haha but that is one of her explicit flaws. I loved Mary's criticism of her handling of the Aspen problem:

#+begin_quote
  “This is so you,” Mary mused, pacing in a circle around the frozen form of Aspen. “One cannot contest that it does the job. And all it cost was a staggering expense of power and the complete reordering of a small patch of reality.”
#+end_quote

I don't necessarily see my criticism as things happening "for the plot", just that the twists can be a bit /too/ unpredictable. For example, if it were revealed that Arachne was an alien wearing an elf mask who had been arranging events the whole time, then it were revealed that Avei actually created the aliens to fuck with Elilial, it'd be surprising, but poorly set up and ineffectively foreshadowed.

Regarding plot armor, I had noticed that unlike Wildbow's writing or PGTE, the protagonists tend to always win their main conflicts, and though they do suffer setbacks, they generally overcome them quickly, or turn them into victories.

Regarding the huge cast, yes I agree it can be annoying to start reading about brand new people when you want to find out about the people you know, but once they're integrated into the story, I'm glad to read about them. The cool thing about having a big cast of characters doing different stuff in different locations is that later on, it can be tons of fun when they meet, like seeing a cross-over episode.

As a counterpoint: lots of people still study and enjoy stories, myths, and plays from ancient Greece, most of which are over 2000 years old.

Some modern references are done well. The Drizzt reference in an early book is great. Light sabers (and their moral questions) are really great too. I giggled at references to Azeroth... But that was the point where the wheels fell off. The anime references, especially with the Sifan references that are blatantly Japanese, just made me roll my eyes. I like anime and nerd pop culture references, but to use another pop culture phrase, the last few jumped the shark.

Once you catch up, I'd advise setting aside the story for long periods and reading a batch of chapters all at once. I think TGAB is a story that suffers from from being published in web-serial format. It would be better as a series of books.

***** I agree with you here; the plot advancement slows to almost a halt in some books because of the constant switching from group to group. I think this is something the author acknowledged as being a problem, because book 14 has so far focused almost entirely on just the paladins. The plot, in return, seems to be moving ahead at quite a brisk pace. It's pretty refreshing!

After those it just keeps getting better, finally finally catching stride in Sarasio and stays at a pretty good peak from there.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean here, but addressing your second point, I don't think there are any inconsistent world or story issues, aside from the areas I mentioned in my criticism, and those I considered more potential for issues rather than actual issues.

If you're asking would TGAB pass [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s strictest purity test? Probably not, but it's a fun story that makes sense when you read it, and so far at least, it's definitely worth the time investment.

**** Well, I don't expect most stories to pass the strictest rational purity test. For instance PGtE isn't super rational, but it's still a quite good story with reasonable semi-rationality in the writing.

What I'm referring to is things that break the consistency of the story and the world. For example, characters who have huge power-ups or abilities that they show once... and then never use again, despite how well those powers would solve the problems they face. A lot of fantasy suffers from this in particular, as the writer often feels free to pen in fantastical solutions to challenges without careful thought as to how those solutions change later plot points or the makeup of the world itself.

***** So far (halfway through Book 9), there haven't been any immersion breaking inconsistencies or plot holes. To the extent that characters refrain from using their full power, there have been well-supported in-story reasons that fully explain that. Nothing like, say, Harry Potter, where the spells from the later books (that the adults presumably knew) could easily solve all the conflicts of the earlier books or other plot holes like that.

*** Well, not every story is for everyone. If you're asking if the "main story" will start soon, I think the answer is probably no. To the extent that one exists, it's probably the story of the gods' history and Elilial's current play. We do continue to get hints, but by Book 9 (and even current, I understand) those hints are all we have. Lots of interesting development does happen with Gabe and other characters, but the story itself will continue to stay about on that level for a while yet.

Maybe someone else who has read more will have some better insight. I just ask that they tag any spoilers outside the scope of this thread.
