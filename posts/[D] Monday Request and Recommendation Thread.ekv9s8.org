Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Are there any good retellings of stories from the perspective of the villain, but made sympathetic and good and reasonable? Maybe set in alternate continuities, or else alleging that the originals were told from the perspective of a /very/ biased narrator? This seems like a pretty straightforward premise but I don't see it too often in fanfiction.

The best example that I know of would be [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA][Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier]], which I believe I've recommended here before and would be happy to recommend again. To quote the YouTube blurb:

#+begin_quote
  Long ago in a Magic Kingdom, one misunderstood Royal Vizier will go on a quest to save his city from its bumbling sultan, an invading prince, and the most notorious thief to ever live! With the help of the Kingdom's free-spirited, teenage Princess, the Vizier must find a magical lamp containing a wish-granting Djinn (who's really funny, by the way) and defeat the city's most-wanted criminal... Aladdin!
#+end_quote

(mild spoiler for the above, unrelated to the main plot but a nice surprise: the other Disney villains [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA&feature=youtu.be&t=5831][have a song in there too]] -- any of /their/ stories fleshed out would also have been welcome)

(/Wicked/ could also qualify, maybe)

I feel that "rational/ist" fiction would be especially appropriate here, since often villain characters are already written to be methodical and ruthlessly calculating (e.g. Danzō from Naruto).

*** The Last Ringbearer seems to fit your criteria. It's a 1999 published Russian novel/sequel of LotR from the perspective of the orcs. Elves are eternal, unchanging oppressors while orcs are designing new technologies and undergoing a industrial revolution. Got released free once copyright laws started applying to Russia.

I bounced off it from translation and political issues, but others might find it good. It is arguably a precursor of rational fiction in that the whole story tries to take an existing fantasy world and retrofit it into realism.

*** /Phantom/, by Susan Kay, re-tells /The Phantom of the Opera/ from the perspective of the titular character. I don't think the continuity lines up (it's trying to walk a tightrope between the novel and the Broadway musical), so this would probably fall under "alternate continuity."

If you like musicals, /Into the Woods/ isn't from the perspective of any of the villains, but it paints both them and the protagonists with a more complicated brush than "one side good, one side evil."

If you like /Wicked/ (the novel, not the musical; they're for very different tastes), Gregory Maguire has written other retellings of classic fairytales (/Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister/ (Cinderella), /Mirror, Mirror/ (Snow White)).

There's the juvenile but funny "The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!" which might not fit but is still worth checking out.

/The Mists of Avalon/ is Arthurian legend from Morgan Le Fay's perspective.

Those are the ones that immediately come to mind, but for more examples (TVTropes warning):

I liked the first a lot, but the reviews of the second make it sound pretty meh. I think I've decided not to see it so as not to taint the first by association. In particular it sounds like they butcher the magic system via over explanation, a system I kind of liked in Maleficent for its vagueness yet sense of having a hidden logical structure behind it.

  Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier
#+end_quote

I finally got around to watching this and it was... okay.

There are a couple of really good songs (A Thousand and One Nights is a stand-out), and the actor for Aladdin pulls off a surprisingly great Smeagol/Gollum act.

That said, it doesn't have quite enough story for its runtime, so it lags in the middle. It's in desperate need of a straight-man for all of the jokes and references (they sometimes try to put Ja'far in that role, but they can't quite commit to it, instead getting him to make a bunch of those references himself). The plot... Let's just say that it faces the choice of being a plot that makes internal sense, or of being an allegory for the [[https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Disney_Post-Renaissance][Post-Renaissance]] Walt Disney Corporation, and it chooses the latter at every opportunity ("Ha ha! Pixar has conquered you, Magic Kingdom!" "We'll pay you a bunch of money, that would be yours anyway if you conquered us, to let the Magic Kingdom buy Pixar instead." "Deal!").

It's a credit to the show that it can rise above most of the stuff I just mentioned and somehow is still very enjoyable. I'm just a little sad at those moments of greatness, the profound emotional arc and the perfectly serviceable plot structure, that could have been expanded upon to make this so much better than "okay"... were pretty much all tarnished by making them subservient to the "Disney sucked between ditching 2D animation and buying Pixar" theme, instead.

**** This is pretty much the anti-Worm webfic. Story tropes are employed and justified rather than subverted, pretty much /everyone/ is secretly a decent person (the Emperor is a nice guy even when it sometimes costs him, the Thieves Guild is more an unofficial anti-corruption agency dedicated to knocking power-hungry people down a peg, the slavering Drow actually have a divine mandate to serve as a barrier between the Surface and the even /worse/ Deep Elves, the Demon Queen cultists mainly try and curtail wild warlocks or demon outbreaks) - it just sometimes takes a few arcs (or a dozen) until that becomes obvious, and /noone/ ever dies.

I'd recommend it for its excellent party banter alone, but it's also got a great magic system and an interesting setting. Also, character development! It's taken a /long/ time until I warmed up to some characters, but by now I really like most of them.

******* Yes, and? I don't particularly /want/ to be afraid for the characters. Why would I want to worry whether some element I like is suddenly going to be taken away from the story?

Not that you actually are in most fiction anyway, since very little fiction kills off the major protagonists (A Song of Ice and Fire being a major exception). A lot of the time it's just "Let's cause them suffering for the sake of suffering".

Take the end battle in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It was 100% clear that J. K. Rowling was never going to kill off any of the protagonists for real (and certainly not in a satisfying way), so killing off Fred Weasley comes off just as a means of causing suffering for the sake of suffering with no actual effect on anything (unlike killing off Dumbledore and Snape which were required for the plot).

The point is that there are many - often better - ways of creating tension than killing off characters. In TGAB the major source of tension is whether and how far Justinian can pull off his scheme.

********* Killing off main characters can work, but it has to be done for actual story reasons, not to "create tension", "make characters experience loss" or other similar bullshit excuses. ASOIAF pulled it off particularly well when GRR established that /anyone/ can die by killing off one of the main protagonists in the end of the first book. The downside to that approach is that your world tends to end up as grimdark and that can be really depressing.

Also consider the real world: There's plenty of tension and suspense in many peoples' lives without anyone necessarily dying. A good writer should be able to do similar things without having to resort to killing people for that purpose unless the setting is particularly militaristic or violent.

*** I suppose rationally speaking, fights at this power level involves:

- bringing an overwhelming amount of firepower and numbers (2x or more against 1)

- meticulous planning & a wide range of options to best exploit any opportunities to use that firepower

- catching the target alone and unaware, or isolating them from reinforcements

- unleashing everything you got at them in seconds so as to exhaust all their options of self-defence, self-recovery or escape

- leaving immediately after the deed whether you succeed or fail at the assassination

It'll be an endless series of alpha strike sneak attacks and ganging up on each other, unless the protagonist is the only one who is overpowered (in which case it's more a man stomping on ants). Either way it's difficult for the writer to make this relatable to the reader.

The main character is extremely talented, so she looks down on everyone else (hence, the personality of an antagonist).

*** It's something I'd like as well. The problem is that overpowered + rational means conflicts get resolved pretty quickly (as others have noted). The bad solution is to randomly throw OP challenges or idiot balls at the protagonist (after noticing the fic is written into a corner). That's extremely unsatisfying because then i) the protagonist isn't OP anymore and ii) the conflict isn't foreshadowed and comes out of nowhere which is always unsatisfying. Many online fictions one finds also describe OP powers, describe how awed everyone is once they are revealed and then just stop (I guess because then comes the difficult bit about how to continue...).

A few categories to work around the problems a OP protagonist causes

- Working under heavy restrictions. E.g. being a god, but unable to take away free choice. Or one of my favourite HP fanfics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] (HP time travel; unfinished). I'd guess [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] that gets recommended here often partially falls into this category as well (protagonist is morally restricted).
- The fictions asking how having OP powers influences the character(s) long term and how the "normals" react. Unfortunately I can only think of "Mortal Gods by Bonnie Quinn" so far.
- The curb-stomp fics. Worm itself isn't one, since the power scales up during it (like a lot of fiction). But there is a lot of Worm fanfic with OP powers (e.g. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/acceleration-worm-au.284714/][Acceleration]] or [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/queen-of-blood-worm-castlevania-complete.363842/][Queen of Blood]]). Search for OP worm fanfic (reddit) and I guess you'll find most of it. Doing the canon challenges using OP powers begs the question a bit in my opinion (but I guiltily read those anyway).
- Throw a difficult problem at the protagonist. But then the question is if the protagonist is still OP. For example this quest was recommended a few threads ago here: [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]] or e.g. "A Soldier's Duty by Jean Johnson" (the latter highlights the problems with extreme competence)
- Fics where the protagonist becomes OP at the end. Worm was already mentioned. One with extreme OPness is e.g. "The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins". But really much fantasy falls into this category, I could list a lot of them. I wouldn't call those fics with overpowered protagonists (since they don't start off overpowered), but you have mentioned "I'm a Spider So What?"...
- Making a comedy (or "light novel"?) out of it, usually with the protagonist being oblivious of the power or the responsibility that comes with it. Like "I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level", "Evil God Average", etc. I haven't read/watched One Punch Man... would that fall into this category? There's tons of (bad) HP and Worm fanfic in this category as well (like the popular HP "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/3/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy by Nonjon]]"; haven't read it, but I guess...).

***** Yes, the early chapters (‘early' in wuxia terms) are much more about signposting to the traditional wuxia crowd, and it only gradually grows into full-on rational fiction. Some things, like the MC being OP, are staples of the genre that will never go away, but they do fade to more just being background facts rather than the core goal the plot focuses around.

The translator changes a fair few times, from initial inexpert fan translations by a few different people, until Webnovel starts paying more real translators, first flycrane01 (starting Ch ~200) and then Henyee Translations (Ch ~1000), each doing significantly better work than the prior.

Though I don't mean to encourage you to do something you dislike. There are plenty of stories that start strong from the beginning, and there's never a guarantee you'll love the latter parts as much as I do.

***** 100 chapters is about how long it took for the author to decide to take the story and characters more seriously than regular xianxia (before then he had set out to make a regular xianxia in a deconstructed setting). The events on the train is basically the point where the author turns over a new leaf.

There's still all the random powerups from the first 100 chapters to grapple with, but over time they're given less and less attention and Li Yao's successes start coming more from his own talents and ingenuity and the author seems to have (from where the translation currently is, at least) planned out how to justify all the powerups in big reveals later on.

Also the translation /does/ improve significantly, to the point where you should be able to easily acclimatize to it. I recommend you give it another shot.

It's really cool how even though I can't see in 4D, I still can get a sense for how 4D objects are constructed and move.

Oh man, oh man, where do I start? [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com/][All Night Laundry]] is an incredible webcomic that has just recently completed (except for the epilogues) and now was a good time to introduce it to you guys. It's a story that started as a short ghost tale that takes place in a haunted laundromat, but it rapidly spiraled into a much larger, intricate story which involves bizarre physics, doppelgangers, eldritch creatures, and read the story to find out! I don't want to say too much more since it's a very spoiler heavy plot line. Zack actually updated this daily for /seven years/ straight.

[[https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/][Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]] is another story that I'm sharing because it just finished. Kim Dokja is an avid reader of a Chinese webnovel, Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World, but the story has become real. However there are signs that he may not be anything more than a character in the first place. Really plays with meta-aware characters and use literary conventions as laws of physics.

The next two stories are short stories that were posted here a while ago that I thought deserved a repost:

[[https://physicsnapkins.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/all-paths-to-happiness/][All Paths to Happiness]] is an interesting take on how powerful a device to stimulate a version of Coil's power from Worm can be. But as discussed in the previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4chu76/all_paths_to_happiness/][thread]], the execution was a little flawed since UFAIs would occur long before the protagonist actually accomplished his goals.

[[http://www.begoodenough.com/the-great-filter/][The Great Filter]] is a novel take on the Fermi Paradox where the Great Filter is time travel. Some interesting discussion in the previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4mwcvl/rt_the_great_filter/][thread]].

Absolute joy, but it's basically the same as every other hfy story so there's not much to say. "Human strong human smart raaaaagghh!". The aliens are the best part of this story, even has well written children in it, which I didn't think was possible to find on reddit.

A bit unconventional, but "The day the world came to town" is a feelgood book. It's a true story based on the events in a town called Gander after 9/11, where several thousand passengers flying to the US ended up. Not only is it fun with a plethora of fascinating characters (the CEO of Hugo Boss, an US general, a family of Jews who starves in silence because there's no kosher food and they don't want to intrude), but the whole book is basically humans being kind to each other. There's some heartbreak in there, but you'll definitely come out feeling good about the future once you're done.

*** I'm going to make some different recommendations, perhaps stretching rational a bit. If you're here and going through [[/r/hfy]] you've already scoured for new ones.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7278544/1/First-Contact][First Contact]] - A Mass Effect Fanfic, unfinished / abandoned so be warned. Doe not requiring a knowledge of the game. Its a soft rational, in that the characters at least move to actively avoid a lot of the cliche's regarding alien first contact. Humans governments deal with alien contract a little to easily. Last Chapter has a very HFY discussion.

If you want longer HFY style things in scifi, I'd recommend this fandom as a whole. A lot of the stories are not rational, and hfy here can be very trope heavy. However their are gems.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny][Forged Destiny]] - Long, and very slow. To it's detriment at parts. It is not a [[https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/the-gamer/list?title_no=88&page=1][Gamer]] ripoff like a bunch of the RWBY stories are, but in a similar vein. Utilizing a non-combat 'skill' in a world based on vague RPG classes to become a powerful warrior.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-fourteen.8938/][With this Ring]] - LOOONG. I've given up on it even with TTS playing it in the background. MC has some amount of Self Insert Knowledge, but having an Orange Ring must operate on selfish motives at all times to function as a superhero. So a lot of the story is 'rationalizing' fixing the world via selfish motive. (In between the much more expansive, less annoying than canon teen drama.) Might strike your fancy more than my own. Make sure to download the thing.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41429774-the-bobiverse][Bobiverse]] The audiobook version of this one is fantastic if you've got the money.

**** As a related recommendation to Forged Destiny, there's also The Games We Play by ryuugi on ff.net. It's not as good as Forged Destiny, but the lore is expanded in a very intriguing way and the powers have fascinating histories (plus it goes up to dbz power levels, which depending on your taste could be fun).

*** I highly recommend /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382450.Fevre_Dream][Fevre Dream]]/, George R.R. Martin's only vampire novel. It's unlike any other vampire story I've read, and it touches on some philosophical topics that would probably appeal to this sub.

If you like scifi, then you might enjoy one of my favorite books: /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36161.The_Madness_Season][The Madness Season]]/ by C.S. Friedman. It has an interesting explanation for the existence of vampires in a scientific world rather than a fantasy one. Woven into the plot, there are some great explorations of truly alien psychology.

For a comedic take on vampirism, I recommend /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183274.Thirsty][Thirsty]]/ by M.T. Anderson. It's a satire of the typical teenage 'turned into a vampire' tropes, and the story contains some of (in my opinion) Anderson's best moments of dark [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism][absurdist]] humor.

The Zamonian books by Walter Moers.

I would recommend starting with "13 ½ Leben des Käptn Blaubär" or "Die Stadt der Träumenden Bücher".

"Rumo" is supposed to be much darker but still very good.

*** [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Eschbach][Eschbach]] has a few thought-provoking thrillers and Sci-Fi book, though I wouldn't call any actually "rational".

[[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eine_Billion_Dollar][Eine Billion Dollar]] has a layabout inherit a sum of one trillion dollar, which came from an influential German merchant four hundred years ago. The story is about him trying to find a purpose which justifies him being gifted so much money, and the temptations he faces along the way.

[[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Letzte_seiner_Art][Der Letzte Seiner Art]] is about ethics in science and war; it's told from the perspective of a young American who joined the Military, where he volunteered for a project that aimed to turn people into Cyborgs.

[[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausgebrannt][Ausgebrannt]] deals with the effect that a sudden drying up of certain important oil fields would have on our society. It follows a German guy who came to the US as a translator for a software project, who has always dreamt of living in the States.

Gurren Lagann is fairly rat adjacent while also being good, but it's an anime; Neon Genesis Evangelion is even further out but is the next closest mech anime that I can actually recommend. There's also a few fanfics of those.

Forty Milleniums of Cultivation has some mechs (and more powered armor) but that's only a secondary focus and it has a weak start.

*** Are you averse to visual novels, anime, or LGBTQ themes? If not, I can recommend [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/][Heaven Will Be Mine]]. In an alternate world, Humanity launched a space program to defend against an Existential Threat which may or may not have been born from the collective Human subconscious. After that war was fought, and Earth started to be afraid of the diverging pilots, the program was scrapped and all pilots recalled back to Earth. Most of them didn't like that one bit, and now two factions are in open rebellion while a third faction tries to get them to come back before Earth loses patience and kills them all. You play as the ace pilot of one of those three factions, and choose how your encounters with the other two characters play out. Each of those three girls really cares for their mission, but they also care for each other a whole lot.

It's a heavily different world which seems to run on either narrative or subjective physics, expressed through Gravity which is how humans decide what is real, and you're often not going to comprehend stuff the first time you read it. Playing [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/435300/We_Know_the_Devil/][We Know The Devil]] might help with that, it's set in the same world, just earlier, and doesn't have mechs.
