Two weeks ago we had that interactive Worldbuilder CYOA surface, and I mentioned how I've wanted to make my own version of a page like that. [[/u/alexanderwales]] very kindly stripped the code from it and guided me through the basics of experimenting with it.

After... Probably more than 30 hours of mostly copypasting stuff and retracing my steps to find out what exactly went wrong to cause something to stop working, I have retrofitted the page into my own CYOA. It takes place in the world I write about, but since I haven't actually released a single chapter, this is the first thing other than a few 'poke holes in this' infodumps that I have presented.

Unlike the Worldbuilder, in my CYOA you are faced with a finished world and just make your own character in it. You have enough arbitrary karma points to build a decent/average magic user, but as with almost every CYOA there is also a boatload of handicaps (Flaws) down at the bottom you can take to give you all the points you want, although the handicaps do get pretty harsh.

As this is the first input I'll be getting from anyone, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Is it far too long? Is there a boring section I should just get rid of? Does it not seem to make sense that certain skills belong to this element or that? Are the arbitrary costs for skills reasonably balanced? Is there an obvious path to world domination I haven't sabotaged with explicit restrictions? Can you think of a good skill or power I haven't included for some reason? Is the whole thing just super boring and pretentious? God forbid, are there any bugs in the code?

I'd love to see the kinds of characters you build, both mechanically and if you feel like sharing what kind of place in life you imagine them having. I kept the Generate Summary feature from the Worldbuilder, and encourage you to post your builds here so I can trawl through them for character ideas.

Edit: The site where I was hosting the CYOA no longer offers free hosting, so the old link is dead. You can download it [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4c7P1yvRkZmNWljSzI2bGN4ZzA][from my google drive]] if you want to play it, but that's about the best I can do for now. Stick the three files in a folder somewhere, then open the index file in an Internet browser of your choice. Do still tell me if you liked it, even though the posts are archived from old age. It fills me with determination to keep writing on my books set in this world.

Will edit with my build when I get a chance.

This is incredible. Well-detailed, well-thought-out, and even convenient in distributing points with the counter!

Edit: my build:

I designed this one based on my own personality, then with as much synergy and cool powers as I could cram in.

--------------

[100] Basic Control over Fire: I am not a passionate or emotional person.

[90] Moderate Potential for Air: I am quite fond of narratives and apply them to life, perhaps more than I should.

[72] High Potential for Earth: I love abstract thought and logic guides most, if not all, of my actions and beliefs. The only reason I'm not higher is that I am not "slow to change."

[62] Moderate Potential for Lightning: I am, not to brag, very charismatic. Joyful and in-the-moment, not so much.

[34] National Outlier in Water: I'm very good at seeing possibilities and manipulating. Very, very good.

[34] Rasp, the Daylight Spear: almost chose Col, but freedom sounds cool too. Maybe I can help her out on my free time.

[34] Special Operations: Just sounded cool. Plus my build lends itself to an elite fighting team.

[26] Deep Mind Reading: A) I'm good at reading people and B) it sounded really, really cool.

[16] Supreme Charisma: Like I said, I'm hard to hate.

[12] Battle Sight: Useful and cool. Especially for SpecOps.

[18] Hostages!: Sadly, I do have a family, and they are the few people I can't be so brutally honest with in real life.

[24] Bad luck!: I do seem a bit misfortunate in real life.

[18] Gaslighting: I'm a skilled liar, and I love manipulation, so I went up a level from what I think I am naturally to have fun.

[10] False Thought: I am like this already, and it seemed cool.

[6] Battle Focus I: I am now an elite ninja fighter; boo yah!

[2] Supreme Defence: To help with fighting.

[0] Supreme Offence: See above.

*TL:DR*: This is based on my own personality. I am very good at manipulation and possibilities, great at logic (though I am changeable enough I rated water higher than earth) and have charisma and subtle madness in equal measure. The plan is to go be a SpecOps agent and have fun taking down powerful mages and being something of a Jack-of-all-Trades (minus fire, of course).

** Focused on building a scientist who can create nanotechnology, end entropy, eliminate scarcity as a concept; the Earth affinity is the foundation of their power. They can manipulate time and thought to do things faster, as well as create zones of sped time to aid other scientists. Ally Kodix can rid them of any sanity issues (maybe he has Soulrape); if not, super speed and a few other perks can be removed in order to get Soulrape oneself. Ally Ulmus helps keep track of the plot while the scientist and allies sequester themselves away, researching and building defenses to ensure safe continuance of research. Brain Storm and Path to Victory, as well as the Water affinity, allow them to know what paths are best to research immediately, meaning a 0% failure rate. Lightning helps with immortality and other things I haven't fully thought through, but since its negatives can be removed so easily, it's too powerful to not take. With so much power, the Salted Earth options, even Great Seal, are easily undone, although the options that lower the world population are avoided, since perfect resurrection doesn't exist.

The primary hurdle I see is keeping the scientist interested in the world, and not going off on one's own like a Transcendent from /A Fire Upon the Deep/. Ally Kodix and Lightning affinity should help with that, but it's open to interpretation. Might need a Soulrape to remove the "Other people do not exist" fault.

** I like your setting quite a bit - I'd be interested in seeing more what characters live there. In general I think the CYOA is well made in that I do get a sense of how any character I make would fit into the setting.

Some of the Black Hand placements say "You must take the Paranoia handicap," but I don't see a handicap called Paranoia. I'm guessing it's meant to be the same as the Schizophrenia handicap, in which case one or the other should be renamed.

I think I may be misunderstanding the Brinksmanship Salted Earth option. Doesn't the ability to make binding precommitments defuse more ruinous geopolitical games of Chicken than it solves?

I think the Altar, and the asymmetry resulting from a war in which only one side has access to it, is a particularly interesting aspect of your setting, though. I'd be interested in more on when and why they use it.

Generate Summary didn't seem to do anything when I clicked it, though I suspect that may be a problem with my browser rather than with the site.

Minmaxer!me says: The side effects from high affinities seem to incentivize spreading out your points on those and going with the specializations that don't rely as much on scaling. Fire isn't versatile enough to seem worthwhile to me, though it does lead to Forge Soulstone, which is one of the best specializations for versatility.

Favourite combo: Path to Victory is impressive on it's own, but becomes /much/ more powerful applied to the right magical senses, i.e. some combination of Lightning and Water Affinities, Read Probability, and/or Death Sight. Brain Storm probably also works well with PtV.

With a magic system this powerful and versatile, I almost feel like there must be an obvious path to world domination, but I haven't found one. Lightning affinity /implicitly/ can't make you much smarter. The best I can come up with at the moment is defeating enemies and making them into soulstones that you use to become better at defeating enemies and making them into soulstones.

It's in the Handicap section because, while it makes sense as a strategic move as long as it's telegraphed to the entire world, it can potentially go horribly wrong. Like if the enemy think you probably did leave yourself some way out of it and Deadman's Switch is in play. In the 'official' timeline Brinkmanship does not happen during the Century, but the main character of the actual books goes down that path eventually.

#+end_quote

At first they use it a lot. It's a fantastic advantage. Unfortunately the other side has the Tower of Souls, which after a little tweaking allows them to take any prisoner of war and costlessly kill off everyone connected to that person by a mutual emotional bond, or by blood, or by sufficient shared history (Former lovers, lifelong friend, etc). The Black also discover that the process of binding yourself with an Oath shapes your soul in a certain way, and the Tower can be made to target this as well. So the more people swear the same Oath, the more likely they lose everyone who took it. At which point they can safely use the same Oath again, until the Black capture one of the /new/ Oathbound...

The White do manage to set up a few locations with strong enough magical protection that the Tower can't reach them, and so those places end up with a /lot/ of people who have Sworn unconditional, never ending obedience to the White leaders. Outside of that, they use Oaths to make special spies, as shown in the Black placement section. A very small number of people, like those who serve the White and take the Custom Rewrite option, get to set their own Oaths, which in-world includes a lot of mental rewiring suggested by people on this subreddit.

The highest Affinity levels do basically turn you into an NPC, but level six (Worldwide Outlier) is doable if you can live with being a weirdo. Spreading your points out has the disadvantage of being pretty expensive too, but I'm glad that out of the comments I've gotten so far, one goes all in on Fire&Water and you feel drawn to broadening it out.

Soulstones do add linearly, so you can rack up a lot of power just by farming prisoners of war for a few decades. That would be unethical though so sociopaths probably wouldn't do that.

#+end_quote

Path to Victory is extremely powerful in combination with the right strategies, and I thought about making it more expensive. I decided against it because there a lot of other powerful things as well. In the 'official' timeline PtV ends up being the death of several Sovereigns, who over- or underestimate it. Now, in the official timeline characters don't get to /choose/ Prophetic powers, but I hadn't considered the Deathsight/PtV combo. That sounds really interesting. I shall have to think on it.

Although not presented as a choice in the CYOA, one character in the world manages to steal not just the magical strength of the victim but their prophetic powers as well. Which is how they got to be one of the Sovereigns in the first place.

** Ok so I tried to get the most powerful character I could focusing on mind control. Hours later what I ended up with is a maniac ruler of the only major remaining city on earth. Enter the God-King subsetting: Pretty much everyone left with any power is fanatically loyal to the God-King. given nearly every catastrophe possible occurred, the only places other the God-King's city with any people left would have to be clustered around people with powerful magic that can save them, given the God-King went extra hard after people such as healers who could do that... there's not many left.

The God-King being biologically immortal was alive during the century of ashes. However he saw it as the actions of petty mortals, and he used the opportunity to gather resources and prepare for "The Great Rebirth" with his acolytes. His preparations made him many enemies and consisted of some horrible (but in his eyes necessary) actions, where among other things he kidnapped massive numbers of mages from the shadows, either turning them to his cause or having his followers create soul gems out of them. In addition he deliberately wiped out survivors he didn't have use for, and he contributed to the already massive biological devastation caused by Poenna. In the end he mostly succeeded at ensuring that his worshipers were the only people left. Without further ado here are the stats:

[100] Basic Control over Air

[60] Worldwide Outlier in Lightning

[0] Soulstone

As far as I know this is the best strategy world domination, if you think you have a better way I would love to hear it though. Ok so I think it's a given that 1: more points is better, and 2: world domination is easier when there's /not much world left/, so you should probably take the endgame and all those disadvantages (except for the great seal since that will make winning near impossible). Also I can't really see many ways ways to win without at least medium tier mind control. I can totally imagine another build, that splits points between mind control and seering that might actually work better, so I'm not saying this is the best possible build, however I think any world domination build will have to share some similarities.

*** Self destructive would be fine, but happiness is one of the things that powers Lightning. The point system I made for this CYOA certainly isn't perfect... In the book version of the world, depression is something some Lightning magicians struggle with - once they lose that spark of joy, their magic weakens... which objectively makes them less useful to those they care for/less able to do anything with their lives, which probably doesn't feel great which... etc, etc. And since Healers are the best suited to mess around with their own minds, things get a bit unpredictable.

One thing I think I haven't communicated well in the CYOA (And will try to fix) is that the issues that come with the highest Affinities aren't side effects that can be neutralized with brain surgery. The strong magic flows /from/ the very unusual/damaged personality. Issues can be managed, but never removed without a loss of magical strength.

**** Is Soulrape brain surgery or soul surgery? If it's the latter - which it sounds like it is - then one can Soulrape so precisely as to eliminate only the capacity to lose one's sanity or humanity. Add in some brain surgery to modulate one's control, and one has the ability to both: without losing oneself, go just as far down the path of insanity as is necessary to utilize the power of one's affinities; and bring oneself back to one's controlled self, from that precipice of insanity or inhumanity from which Soulrape has made it impossible to fall.

***** The soul in my world is part of the mind and resides in the brain, but persists without it. When Soulrape eliminates something from the soul, either it very easily and conveniently erases the same thing from the brain, or if you carefully remove it only from the soul, you enter a phase where the remaining soul begins to treat what was removed as false - and it begins to fade from the brain as well. The mechanism for this has nothing to do with reality and is entirely fantasy... But what it boils down to is that it's brain surgery that can take a little time to kick in.

You can use Soulrape, which I did consider naming Soulsculpt because it's not Always Evil, to burn away unhealthy things and improve a person's sanity, but you are then burning away part of what made them so strong in the first place. This may be most easily demonstrated in the case of Air: the mind has to be very unusually prone to faith/fatalism/trusting their intuition to be touched by prophetic powers or able to bring back the souls of the deceased, but the power of destiny coursing through them is not a single yes or no check. If their faith/fatalism/trust of intuition gets stronger, so will their Air magic, but the wishes of Destiny, presented to them in the form of those intuitions, tell the person what to do in more and more situations the stronger they get. Tempering the person's trust in/inclination to listen to their intuition immediately leads to a lowered Air Affinity.

You can change someone's personality, temporarily or permanently, with for example drugs for temporary changes, and that will change their Elemental strengths, but if you tone down the extremes of a person's psychological makeup, that will also affect their magic.

The best way I've found which works in retaining some control once a character goes maximum Affinity is with Oaths: They bind behaviour, but not thought (Unless the Oath is about thoughts, which yes then that can affect your Affinities). So you can be extremely emotional and strong in fire, but if you have bound yourself to act in certain ways in certain situations, that will still be reflected in your action, even if you are not capable of actively pausing to make long term plans.

If the effect is wholly tied to psychology, then I would argue any brain surgery that gives one the ability to completely give in to their affinity, yet still bring themselves back under control when the need for using the extremes of their affinity passes, would be just as powerful as one without the surgery. I analogize it as brain surgery assisted method acting - instead of temporarily increasing ability, one temporarily lifts restrictions on ability, with no chance of losing one's sanity or humanity.

If you look under White Hand specific specializations, this is basically what Contingent Rewrite does. The main point being, /when/ the user is jacked up to maximum Affinity, there is no way to do away with the overpowered-NPCification without also taking the power away. The thing that cannot be done is to have maximum affinity /and/ be sane. Also radically altering your brain state back and forth is probably going to go wrong at /some/ point, but there is no reason in principle why you couldn't program someone to bounce around all over the place Affinitywise. Just... since they aren't themselves while at maximum Affinity, and their worldview might be significantly different, you'd have to treat them like a possibly malignant general artificial intelligence that knows it has an off switch.

Perhaps the best analogy would be the magical gene Harry thinks he's deduced in HPMOR. Something external to the user, in this case a non-thinking, mechanistic force of nature which people in this world call an Element, continuously checks the mind state of the magic user, and makes itself more and more responsive to the user depending on how well they mash with what the force has been programmed to hold as the kind of mind it should serve.

Lightening, Air and Water make me fast in various ways. Lightening for true speed, air for the sonic launch, and water for time control. Illusions and Real time Rewrite also let me cheat to make people think I'm fast.

Alien Focus Doubles my thinking speed, and with Healing it can go still higher.

The rest of the build is mostly there to keep me not dead in a post-apocalyptic hellhole.

I'm imagining that Poena is the holder of the Tower of Souls, as she seems like potentially the most useful of the Ten to clean up after the Century of Ashes and she's also the only one specifically mentioned in the Salted Earth options other than Vance, and his Great Seal cost is too high.

Tongue & Pen, Cascade and Soulsculpt are the key elements here. Given that Soulsculpting can't be reversed, Tongue & Pen shows who someone could have been and the imprint of futures that never were, and Cascade shows what changes actions now will have in the long run, this seems like the best way to change someone's mind permanently.

I wanted a character who has the raw strength to reach Poena after the rest of the Ten have been wiped from the board, and then the ability to not wipe her from existence with Soulfire, but to Soulsculpt her into Poena the Benevolent Mother, as planned by Vance.

** Why should I do everything myself? I am a god after all. Sure, you'll probably betray me, (bastards) but I'll see it coming, then burn that desire away from your soul. Now everyone is happy!

With huge affinities for water/air and the logic of earth, I understand nearly everything and I'm absolutely certain I'm the god this world needs. Tack on deep mind reading, path to victory, and an artifact for soulrape (I feel like it's cheating the point costs, but meh) I understand everyone and can sear away anything objectionable within them.

Now I just need to win people over to my cause (cleanse the world of all the /other/ crazies, usher in a new age lead by my totally-not-a-cult) then evaluate/condition them for absolute loyalty. They 'recruit' others pyramid scheme style, and pretty soon there's an army of utterly loyal, driven folks knocking on the black hand's kings' doors.

Once all this war nonsense is cleared up, we fix all of its lingering after effects, then implement the Seal with Vance to prevent this sorta thing from happening again.

Notes: I wanted to be a sociopath too, but you can only select one sanity adjustment. I'd also like to be able to reorganize the summary to make more sense, or have it listed in a more intuitive order. (all +point mods, associations, affinities, then specializations and misc stuff.)

** The summary is buggy, it seems. Since the gen_summary function throws an error, here's the raw text in the =#summary= p tag:

#+begin_example
  Lightning 5|Water 2|Air 1|Earth 1|Fire 3|Charisma 0|2|Air 1|Earth 1|Fire 3|WhiteSovereigns 2|Charisma 0|2|Air 1|Earth 1|Fire 3|WhiteSovereigns 2|Charisma 0|2|Air 1|Earth 1|Fire 3|WhiteSovereigns 2|Charisma 0|complic_tbl2 4|Leadership 2|Aura 1|complic_tbl1 0|Pain 1|Pathology 0|Liar 0|BlackSpy 0|BlackSpy 0|BlackSpy 0|BlackSpy 0|BlackSpy 0|BlackSpy 0|BlackSpy 0|
#+end_example

Things to note:

1. There're two isolated =2|=s sitting in there.
2. There's a lot of repeated elements (most obvious with all the =BlackSpy 0|=s at the end).

My suspicion for number 2 is that it has something to do with choosing Black Spy and then selecting another Placement. Doing so deselects Black Spy (even though Black Spy is compatible with the other Placements), but may not trigger the refund function.

I have no idea what's causing =2|=s , or why the elements that aren't Black Spy were being repeated.

I did come up with a very simple way to reproduce the problem:

1. Refresh the page.
2. Choose to serve either the black or white hand.
3. Choose "spy" as your placement.
4. Now choose one of the other placements.

After those steps, if you open the console and find the =#summary= p tag, you should see something like:

#+begin_quote
  WhiteSpy 0BlackPlacements 2|
#+end_quote

Note how it's missing the =|= that should be between 0 and BlackPlacements.

Looking up the code for generating the summary started me down a rabbit hole. One thing led to another and I basically rewrote all the code. It satisfied my desire to tinker with other people's code (it's heavily commented, in case you want to see what I did).

I only did some cursory testing, but it looks like it completely solved the bug. Among other things, I changed it so that you don't need to make as many refund calls.

For example, in the =#BlackSide= button you have the following refund calls (I added the line breaks for clarity):

#+begin_example
  refund('WhiteSovereigns',4);
  refund('WhiteSovereigns',3);
  refund('WhiteSovereigns',2);
  refund('WhiteSovereigns',1);
  refund('WhiteSovereigns',0);
  refund('WhitePlacements',4);
  refund('WhitePlacements',3);
  refund('WhitePlacements',2);
  refund('WhitePlacements',1);
  refund('WhitePlacements',0);
  refund('WhitePlacements',5);
  refund('BlackSpy',0);
  refund('WhiteAllies',0);
  refund('WhiteAllies',1);
  refund('WhiteAllies',2);
  refund('WhiteAllies',3);
  refund('WhiteAllies',4);
  refund('WhiteOnly',0);
  refund('WhiteOnly',1);
  refund('WhiteOnly',2)
#+end_example

With the change I made, all you need to do is:

#+begin_example
  refund('WhiteSovereigns');
  refund('WhitePlacements');
  refund('BlackSpy');
  refund('WhiteAllies');
  refund('WhiteOnly')
#+end_example

Basically, you can replace all your separate refund calls with just one for each category.

Feel free to ask me if you have any questions or if I've screwed up in some way. I'd be happy to keep working on this when I wake up tomorrow.

You can find my rewritten code [[http://pastebin.com/BXvUUknT][at this pastebin]]. You should be able to just copy and paste in the javascript file (the HTML will work fine with no changes). Remember to make a copy of your current file if you do want to replace it with this one.

For some reason, the first time I was working on this it gave me more points than I should have had. Anyway, it should work now.

The idea is that, well, the Black Hand are pretty horrible and therefore I will do my utmost to assist the White Hand. If the White Hand reclaim the Tower of Souls, they will sacrifice themselves to take out the Black Hand. This leaves me pretty well-placed to make something of myself in the hopefully still reasonably intact world that remains.

Combat is not really my thing - it tends to be both dangerous and not decisive. Gathering intel and manipulating events behind enemy lines is much more important. The key to winning the war looks to be in making as much use of the neutral parties and internal divisions of the Black Hand as possible so as to fragment their power.

Had I more points, or more will to sacrifice to gain more points, I'd probably focus on getting more powerful time control and maybe mixing in some illusions and the like.

The problem with the handicaps tends to be that either they're Salted Earth ones, in which I accept responsibility for way too much death and destruction for my liking, or they hinder me by making me less effective. I took the ones that looked like they wouldn't really harm me.

I did go over with Endgame on and do the whole 'take everything that I can live with, min-max for great justice' routine, but I didn't save it nor put in too much thought. If I am not constrained properly by morals or character concept or the like, just munchkining the mechanics isn't that much fun.

I recall the main concept was essentially to build an extremely socially capable mage with tons of subtle but powerful abilities aiming to manipulate my way to victory, but dropping 10 points on Contingent Rewrite that lets me, if forced into a direct confrontation, suddenly turn into a ridiculously powerful combat monster with legendary affinities in all the places that my main persona is weak at. I expect it might come as somewhat of a shock to whoever's accosting me at the time.

*** Thank you!

As for the setting, I will try to explain. Sorry for the length. This is set in a world I'm writing a book about, and takes place a few hundred years before the book. The technological level of the world before the Kings and Queens rise is roughly that of Rome at its apex, but with royalty/the priest class having moderate magical powers. The Kings and Queens take over a place a bit like the library of Alexandria, if the library never destroyed anything and had lots of hidden and forbidden tomes on history and dark magic. And a prison full of heretics and war criminals. The Kings and Queens get to be the leaders of the revolution because they are the most successful people alive at fighting the demons, and that usually means they eagerly experimented with magic and/or were willing to pursue forbidden 'lost' knowledge. So there you have a set of leaders who were very callous, very interested in learning, and experienced at thinking outside the box. So. There is an explosion in magical knowledge as they share (most of) their knowledge with each other, and combine and refine each others' work, as well as what they find in the library. From the library they realize that mundane technological progress has /also/ been stifled by the old kingdom, so they invest massively in developing new ways of doing things, with magic and without. They take over the old empire, and force everyone they can to become a magic user and a scholar. They basically turn Rome (the city at the center of the empire) into one giant university with tens of millions of students. So... there's an industrial revolution.

This MYC has you the player be born toward the end of the war between the Kings and Queens and the demons, the demon race is extinct and their world destroyed while you are still a teenager in a victorian era boarding school. By the time the Kings and Queens divide into two factions and start a civil world war, technology is starting to approach world war 1 levels. If you choose the Endgame, everything is shifted forward a few decades and we have world war 2 level tech.

In the book world, the world war ends with all leaders dead, all cities everywhere magically nuked, 98% of humanity dead, most children born crippled magically, and most survivors /extremely/ hostile to magic and technology. A war between people who want to stay low tech and people who want to be the new Kings and Queens and reinvent all the technology that got nuked ends with the world forcibly returned to medieval tech and only royalty allowed to use or even know magic, like before the Kings and Queens arose.

So... the books have a medieval world. Most of the world history has low tech. But the MYC takes place during a century long race from Rome to WW3. It is very likely that my view of the world as 'mostly' low tech carried over into the MYC. Thank you for pointing this out. I will have to give some thought to how to present things.

As for elements not quite fitting what falls under them... Lightning is what the people in my world call the element that lets you throw lightning bolts. In the books the characters will eventually grow rationalist and realize that the elements have bullshit inaccurate labels and are in desperate need of scienceing, but just to clear up Lightning: It would be more accurate to call it the element of Life, with electricity being the thing that's tacked on. It's still arbitrary, but there are only five elements, and they all have rather a lot of different things slapped under the same labels.

Healing and resurrection being related was part of the plan originally, and in the book world they certainly are, but I'm completely new to writing code (Remember, the code for this MYC is retrofitted, not written from scratch), and I couldn't see how to give skills prerequisites (In Affinities or prereq skills) without the whole thing being much more clunky and requiring you to go back and purchase skills from other sections before you could buy what you wanted. In the book world, there are no spells or specific 'skills' by any label. Magic is five forces of nature, and they can be scienced. There is no Fireball. There is only converting a minuscule amount of matter into heat and forcing all the energy to go in mostly one direction.

**** Thanks for this insight! It sounds very interesting, is this book a work in progress?

Also, I'm interested in creating my own CYOA, I was wondering if you could advise me on how I could go about doing this? (like how you got this up and running), Thanks!

***** It's a book (series) I'm actively writing, although the muse of sitting-down-to-actually-write comes and goes. I've written 90% of one book, but it turned out crap so I shelved it and called it practise. I'm currently writing a second one, and so far it's much better, and might actually be worth showing people when it's done.

I'm a little busy for most of the day, but I'll be back tonight. I got a lot of help myself to get this one started, so I'll happily pay it forward.

****** I can see the source code behind your CYOA page, however I see your CYOA page is stored on google drive, what kind of file are you using? When I create a document on google drive it looks nothing like that. Just wondering how I can get about setting up the page to start off, thanks!

******* Three files. html, js and css. The original files that went into the Worldbuilder CYOA are [[http://pastebin.com/uu82QFPw][style.css]], [[http://pastebin.com/iseww34z][index.html]] and [[http://pastebin.com/S2nU0Eh9][script.js]]. My versions contain a few bits and pieces of broken code and shoddy work arounds, so you can have them if you want, but I think you are probably better off starting with the originals. For me, most of the work was done in the html.

When you download the files, they will probably end up style.css*.txt* etc, so you'll have to cut off the offending .txt. Once the extensions are fixed you can just open up the html in a browser of choice and it should display like a normal website.

If you want to keep your own stuff at google drive as well, you can upload it [[http://www.labnol.org/internet/host-website-on-google-drive/28178/][here]].

Got it to work with the 3 files you linked to. I'm working on putting together the data, then I'll adapt the html to suit it. I'll let you know how it's coming along!

One question - any idea how long do the websites that [[https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz7Mb1OJWnFz_osp7K9G_4wesHlzyPZYOtbBFu--prJj1Hb1C83/exec][this script]] creates, stay around for?

Edit: nvm, I see I can just delete the folder from within Google Drive..

Please do! I like CYOAs, so if you want my thoughts on anything, about the code or the content, I'd be happy to help. Of course, even if you need no feedback, you must still tell us when it's complete!

********** Hi Rhamni,

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/4e8ugk/i_built_a_website_where_you_can_create_your_own/][I finished making my CYOA!]] It got me really interested in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (I had barely any knowledge of the first two and had never written JavaScript before). I was looking up how to do things like crazy! And I learned /so much/. Aside from my work and studies, I basically stopped doing anything else to focus on this, building it all from the ground up, creating new code, new content, and new images.

Thank you so much for getting me off the ground with this project - couldn't have done it without your help.

Please take a look - I'm eager for your feedback.

*********** I've gone to bed. I'm... finding myself doing the CYOA anyway, but if I don't finish it tonight I will get right on it tomorrow!

So far, all I can say is that it looks very promising. And also that pressing Priest selects Bard. And pressing Bard does nothing. Which if it's the same mistake I left in in mine is because you deleted the entry in the table before Priest and forgot to shift the numbers. :p

I will have meaningful feedback for you tonight or tomorrow, but I'm very glad I was able to help you get started. I was just paying it forward, and I'm really glad it helped.

***** Seconded. I enjoy worldbuilding moreso than the average person, and was fine that it was just a choice maker, but I was (unpleasantly) surprised that there wasn't actually an adventure.

I would be supremely impressed if you could make a CYOA that incorporated all of these traits.
