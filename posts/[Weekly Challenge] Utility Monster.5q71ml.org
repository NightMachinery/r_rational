   :END:
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5nfrlg/biweekly_challenge_megastructures/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "The Heist". The winner was [[/u/cjet79]], with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5nfrlg/biweekly_challenge_megastructures/dcsa1n6][The Unending Land]]. Go read it now!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time the prompt will be *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster][Utility Monster]]*. It's not necessary to go /full/ utility monster, but the core concept should ideally revolve around both utilitarian thought and challenges to it from entities which receive more utility per resource than their peers. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, February 8th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be *Games*. It's your choice of either games in the sense of gamification, or games as conflict resolution, though ideally I'd like to see a mix of both. Making up a game from scratch would be appreciated but is not required; it's also not necessary for the reader to know all the rules of the game in question, so long as they know the ones that are important to resolving the conflict. There are a number of IP franchises that revolve around the playing of games or sports, many of which I think are ripe targets.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 2/8.* Please private message me with any questions or comments.


** Saw this heading just now so I whipped this up real quick as this idea stuck with me. It's very short (308 words), but I think it could be shorter if anything and still communicate the same amount.

(thanks to an article my husband posted on OMfCT a few weeks ago for the inspiration for this...)

**** That's the idea; the utility monster angle is that the happiness of the bat is worth more than the happiness of the families who would have otherwise been torn apart by malaria.

***** As a species we'll happily kill animals for food, for research, for sport, to prevent population explosions, to end a threat, to make room for new properties, etc., but for some reason we attach particular weight to the extermination of a species.

Killing millions upon millions of animals each year is fine, but eradicating one species crosses the line. We're like a serial killer who always spares one member of a family before moving onto the next. Somehow we imagine that this is better, that the scale of death is meaningless because it's never quite total.

We're a very annoying species, I must say.

****** People are weird. That said,I don't know much about malaria. With modern treatment, do people still die? If not, reducing poverty will probably be better than killing all mosquitoes.

****** This is not because we intrinsically value their individual lives, but because we might need them as a species in the future. In this light, keeping a few around in order to breed them if they turn out to be unexpectedly useful makes sense.

Additionally, there are diminishing returns on any eradication efforts, because killing off all of a species is much harder than killing off most of them in the same way that getting a car completely clean is harder than just getting it mostly clean.

There's also possible knock-on effects like an unforeseen keystone species that feeds on that animal and gets driven to extinction as well, devastating the entire ecosystem for that area.

******* There are diminishing returns, but there are significant advantages to finishing an eradication. We don't need to get smallpox vaccines anymore.
