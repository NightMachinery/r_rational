I love criticism. I always wonder why most people don't. It's someone telling you what you're doing wrong and how to fix it! How great is that? Strangely, my attitude isn't shared by most people, but that's their loss.

Thanks to my affection for criticism, I've long been interested in the subject of how to critique well. When it comes to critiques of amateur literary work by other amateurs, it seems that some useful advice is in order.

The problem with most fanfiction critiques is that they're small. A real critique should examine every single element of the text and rip it all to pieces. It should be nasty and bloody and if you can't handle it you don't belong in writing. Which isn't to say that the tone shouldn't be civil, but like Dolores Umbridge and her introductory speech in the Great Hall, just because you're being polite doesn't mean you're not tearing down the very foundations of what you're examining.

This is what a real critique is not:

"I thought maybe you phrased this sentence a little awkwardly I think this word should come first and that one second. Also, you used this word twice here in two sentences and it sounds kind of funny. And you missed a comma here and have one there where there shouldn't be and you misspelled 'fartboogers.' I liked the way you described Naruto's chest hair but I thought it was kind of out of character."

You know what I mean. The problem with these small comments is that if these problems are truly the extent of the problems of the text, then the text is fucking brilliant. Most fanfiction is fucking shit. I should know; I've written some.

Here is the Fundamental Law of Criticism: The amount of criticism is proportional to how shitty the product is, or, the amount of criticism is inversely proportional to how good the product is. Apparently most fanfiction critics think that what we write is a short editing job away from being fucking Hamlet.

So if you take the shit-tastic story I'm writing [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-legend-of-korra-book-4-a-matter.286353/][(plug!)]], there is so, so much wrong with it. Not little spelling errors and awkward sentences. Not small revisions to make something clearer or more effective. HUGE THINGS, HUGE FUCKING THINGS ARE WRONG WITH EVERYTHING. The slow-moving plot, characters that fail to be compelling, the lack of tension in every scene...these are the problems. We are very, very far away from focusing on improving sentences, which is what most fanfiction critiques boil down to. Sentences, paragraphs, entire chapters of my story should be thrown out by the bucketful. That's the level we're on (I'm on). Fine tuning a piece of shit still leaves you with shit. The criticisms we need should be aimed at turning the shit into gold, not making the shit smell less bad.

Of course, this is difficult. Taking a critique that basically leaves you needing to throw out 10,000 words is painful. Giving an effective critique like that requires knowing a lot about writing and stories. So it's tough. But it's necessary if you want something beyond shit.

I think there are basically two kinds of useful critiques that we don't see enough of. One is an in-depth analysis that breaks down the core elements of the story and explains what works and what doesn't work. The reader of the analysis should gain a thorough and specific understanding of where the story succeeded and where it failed without even being familiar with the story itself. This requires some knowledge of the fundamentals of what makes a story worth reading, and I think comparisons to similar stories that did a better job is really useful.

An in-depth analysis should be long and high on specifics and details. It should also make clear use of literary terms. The analysis (for that is what this is---an analysis more than a critique per se) can also be focused on a specific part of the story rather than comprehensive, and that would probably be more useful, since a really in-depth analysis would be really long. (Someday I'll write an analysis comparing the beginning chapters of HPMOR to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in an attempt to explain why the latter's opening rocked so hard and the former not so much. There's no way it would be under 20 pages.)

To give an example, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BM5bH5N74WfWNaikBk6PUDb3S2maacjYEFPspfd4utM/edit?usp=sharing][here's]] what a partial outline of such an analysis would look like. Yes, I said partial outline. The real outline would be twice as long at least, and as for the actual analysis itself...I don't if or when I would ever stop. While it was intended as more of a critique of the show's writing than as something useful for a writer to improve, I hope it gives you a sense of what I mean by a specific, thorough analysis of the primary elements of what makes a story work as they are present and absent in whatever story is the subject of the analysis.

The other kind of critique (response, really) that I'd like to see more of is a Wise Reading. Part of the reason you don't see it more often is that it's hard to do. Its difficulty lies in what you're not doing: you're not telling him what the author did wrong and how they can fix it. You're telling them your honest reactions to every element of the story. I wrote about this [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ugbj9/looking_for_a_dozen_wise_readers/][here.]]

Call this Wise Reading. To quote Orson Scott Card,

#+begin_quote
  A Wise Reader is not someone to tell you what to do next--it's someone to tell you what you have just done. In other words, you want your spouse or friend to report to you, in detail and accurately, on the experience of reading your story.
#+end_quote

The Wise Reader doesn't say if your story is "good" or "bad." He doesn't say if you have too much dialogue or if the characterization is thin. He simply tells you the honest experience of reading the story.

The key to understanding when a comment is Wise Reading or something else is to realize that a Wise Reader can never be wrong. A Wise Reader is reporting their feelings. A Critical Reader or a Helpful Reader can be wrong.

For example, a *Wise Reader* will say, "I was bored by Korra." A *Critical Reader* will say, "Korra is boring." A *Helpful Reader* will say, "Give Korra a personality transplant and a cybernetic arm. That'll make her interesting."

The key difference is that the Wise Reader is definitely right, or, at the very least, if he's wrong, the writer has no ability to know that. The Critical and Helpful Readers, on the other hand, might very well be wrong. One reader's opinion is not proof that Korra is boring. Giving her a cybernetic arm might not make her interesting. But if a reader says, "I was bored," he's right, period, end of story.

What makes Wise Reading important kind of critique is that

a) it is extremely rare, so let's see more of them, and

b) It provides you a unique kind of feedback that keeps you moving forward as a writer.

A bit more on b). You have a million terrible words inside you and you have to write them all out before you can get to the good ones (I'm on word 229,137 myself). You will best learn how to write by writing and writing and writing. Spending too much time critiquing and being critiqued, revising and editing and rewriting and critiquing again and you will never learn how to write. Write, accept that it was shit, move on.

Compare this to chess. Everyone knows that only patzers (chess slang for someone who sucks at chess) think they can get better at chess by doing puzzles and reading books. The best way to achieve rapid improvement is to play, play, play against stronger opponents. Without even analyzing why you won or lost, over time you'll learn the patterns of different positions and what kinds of moves work and don't work. This works because you have the most important kind of feedback: the result of the game. Did you win or lose?

Chess players don't play by calculating all the possibilities. That would take forever. They play by being familiar with the position in front of them. After having seen similar positions a thousand times, they instantly understand the salient attributes of the position and know the best or several of the best moves to play.

The same is true of writing. Good writers don't think, "Hm. This character needs more characterization. I think I'll read a [[http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Fiction-Writing-Characters-award-winning/dp/1599632128][book about it.]]" They've read so many great stories and have written so much themselves that they can produce something pretty incredible without too much actual deliberation.

Only Wise Reading is compatible with this strategy for improvement. Only Wise Readers tell you whether and where you won or lost without taking too much of your time on comprehensive analysis that can be useful and interesting but doesn't ingrain hundreds of different patterns into your memory. It gives you a path to move forward ("I guess I should try to make things less boring") without giving you too much reason to redo what you've already done. A Wise Reader gives you crucial feedback without slowing you down. A Wise Reader tells you what is effective about your writing and what is not. This information is necessary if you're going to improve. But it doesn't sit you down and tell you why. Quit wasting time and write another story.

Wise Readings preserve the author's ego (“I was bored” is an incontestable, inoffensive fact in a way that “Your story is boring” is not) while providing the author with crucial feedback that he's not getting anywhere else.

Both of these types of critique/response are costly. They're long and involved in a way that the typical fanfic critique is not. But that is part of the point---real criticism is long and involved. Quid pro quo exchanges of involved responses could be helpful.

Of course, criticisms and suggestions that fall outside of two kinds of responses I delineated here are also perfectly legitimate and can be extremely helpful, particularly for a story that is hugely broken along a highly observable line that can be expressed to the author simply and quickly. But I think that even just using in-depth analysis and Wise Readings as inspirations for shorter comments aimed at specific parts or elements of a story could be really useful. Certainly there seems to be a paucity of such comments at present. In fact, I'm sure that shorter, more tightly focused in-depth analyses and Wise Readings could be really useful.

Naturally, I'm always open to criticism. Thoughts/comments? What do you disagree with? What could be clearer? What should I add/take out?


** Having read your post, I find I agree with most of it. The only reservation I have is that the mechanics of writing being neglected is basically often enough to cause me to just quit reading a story before it has a chance to develop at all - if a story has malapropisms every third sentence, or uses case badly, or doesn't put new speakers into a new paragraph, or uses SMS shorthand like 'u' in place of 'you' or similar major mechanical errors, I will stop reading and not come back no matter what the plot or characters promise to become.

Perhaps it is because your writing is sufficiently well-developed that you already have mastered the difference between 'defiantly' and 'definitely', unlike seemingly half of fanfic writers. So for you advice about how to format your writing is basically worthless. However, a lot of people, especially fanfiction writers, have yet to master such difficult elements as "Dialogue from a new speaker should occur in a new paragraph" (this specific example is violated by 3 of the 17 newest English HP fanfic stories on fanfiction.net at the time of this writing within their first three paragraphs).

Basically, your own writing is not so bad that its terrible format errors eclipse the actual story you are trying to tell. But for some writers this is really, really not true and for them the advice 'come back when you've learned the basic mechanics of how to write in English' is warranted, if impolite, and before they fix that basic mechanical level of writing I won't ever read their fiction no matter how good the plot or characters are.

Basic mechanics of how to write, and discussions of similar matters, are not particularly helpful to you. But a lot of writers are not as competent in these matters as you, and therefore their stuff is doomed before it ever gets to the point of "Does this 'story' have a plot?" or "Do I care about any of the characters?".

Semi-off-topic: Finally, I am not entirely sure I would take serious writing advice from OSC about plot, characters, and so forth. The Wise Reader stuff I think is interesting, but I would take what he's written with a grain of salt. I personally found Ender's Game engaging and interesting, and one of my favorite novels in my youth (even though it aged poorly). However, I have never really been similarly engaged by anything else OSC has ever written - and I have tried a lot. I wasn't enthused by:

- Any of the Ender's Game sequels, including Children of the Mind/Xenocide or the Bean stuff
- Any of the Alvin maker books (tried reading three of them, couldn't even remember titles now).
- The Homecoming Saga (book 1, anyway)
- Pastwatch Christopher Columbus.
- A few non-series books (Wyrms, Magic Street, Enchantment).

The only thing he wrote besides Ender's Game that I liked at all was the Worthing Saga short fiction collection, and even then a lot of the short stories in it were forgettable (like 3 of them were actually memorable and good). It feels to me that whatever OSC's writing and editing process is, it only spits out a good worthwhile read once in every twenty times or less. Does any of his non-Ender's Game series get drastically better after the first book?

*** Certainly. My original post assumes a certain level of authorial competence.

Card is wildly inconsistent both from book to book and from page to page within a single book, and all of his series face massive drop-offs in quality. Someone once wrote an article about how they think his work is written by committee. I thought /Ender's Shadow/ was good and to a lesser extent /Shadow of the Hegemon,/ and the final two books were pretty meh. Same with the Ender Quartet: /Ender's Game/ and /Speaker for the Dead/ are great, /Xenocide/ and /Children of the Mind/ both quite weak. Same with Alvin Maker: first half good, second half bad. I liked Pastwatch, although it was also very inconsistent.

But when Card is good, he's good, and a lot of his writing advice seems smart and useful.

** I'm pretty sure I don't have the literary knowledge to offer criticism of the first kind - takes a special kind of reader to produce that detailed critique and analysis, and I'm just not it. Nor are most people commenting on fanfic, hence the sentence-level focus on "this is worded clunkily" when you're not equipped to tear apart the work as a whole.

Introspecting and reporting the experience of reading though... that sounds more doable. Takes a watchful eye on your own reactions, but it is at least something I already notice, at least a little.

*** Undoubtedly the response should be tailored to the needs and abilities of both the author and the responder. I myself wouldn't write a 50-page analysis for every work I wanted to critique either.
