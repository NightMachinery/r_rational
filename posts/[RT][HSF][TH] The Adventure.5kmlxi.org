** You know, this is the sort of thing I really love about the rational/LessWrongish/rational-adjacent crowd. The optimism and chance at a happy ending in the real world. That thing that made me flip from being a nihilistic closet-non-cultist among cultists to an optimistic sane sort of person (well, by my estimation at least). Really liked that possible world, and the different modes of thinking and interacting with those around Grant were really fun.
