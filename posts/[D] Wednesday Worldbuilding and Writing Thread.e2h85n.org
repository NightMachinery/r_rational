Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Hi, my friend and I are working on a setting that includes a huge freshwater sea, in the middle of which is a gargantuan tiger skull, the size of a large island. The skull is a remnant of a tiger with a ridiculously powerful healing ability, along with slow, consistent growth. Think Deadpool levels of regeneration, just a bit slower. Additionally, the skull (and the animal it came from) slowly grows larger, and the bones denser.

Periodically, semi-random places on the bone will begin regenerating meat and blood, creating growing temporary plains of living tissue, which are soon scoured clean by animal life. These points are semi-random in that there is some node at the base of the skull nearer to which these meat spouts are more common.

The bones regenerate faster than the meat, and are harder to break, which is why the bones haven't been broken down, and any time the power attempts to grow beyond a skull, the cartilage connecting to other bones gets eaten away, breaking the connection to the power. So the creature is trying to regenerate, but can't do it as fast as the animals that eat any part of it that they can.

There are a lot more details to this setting, and a lot beyond just this specific area that I could talk about, but I don't want to prejudice any possible responses.

The Question: What kind of ecosystems (both human and animal) do you think would develop over the few thousand years this skull has been here? The details of the rates of meat regeneration and size growth aren't set in stone, and can be adjusted to support any really cool ecosystems ideas and story settings. If you find something broken about this power, we could adjust it until it's fixed, or accept it and see what systems of humans and animals would crop up to exploit it.

Thanks for your help guys

*** The skull likely provides a higher energy source of food than you'd get from any of the classical sources of energy, e.g. the sun or methane vents or whatever else. At the base layer of your ecosystem is whatever directly feeds on the regenerating material, and the ecosystem grows from there.

There are lots of different things you might do for that base layer. It might be plants that are sucking the nutrients up, hooking into the blood stream and hijacking the magically-created nutrients to grow into colossal trees (though a real-world tree like that just wouldn't exist, because it would need too many adaptations). Or maybe the base layer is some kind of small vermin with a large litter, which is particularly good at processing whatever can be scraped from the skull as soon as it forms, and is then eaten by even larger things. Whatever you pick, that's going to really inform the ecosystem as a whole.

For adaptations, you might have a larger animal that intentionally keeps sites clear of other predators/consumers so that the skull can grow a sizeable mound of flesh that the larger animal is more adept at consuming. Here, I'm thinking about something like a lion, which is fairly bad at getting every last bit of meat from the bone, and eventually hits diminishing returns from trying. The mechanism for allowing build-up might vary, but it would create a rule that if you see a spot of the skull where there's a sizable chunk of flesh, you had better watch out.

**** Thanks for your response! As far as the base layer goes, I'd been imagining that the frequency of meat spouts would be too low to allow a consistent layer of bacteria. However, I didn't take into account the fact that animals of any significant size will find it hard to remove all the meat from a flat surface of bone, which could leave enough small pieces for a layer of bacteria to form. Perhaps some kind of moss would spread? The idea of carnivorous trees is definitely one we'll need to think more about, and as far as larger animals go, I'm definitely imagining that you'd see some extremely territorial animals, or perhaps pressure towards animals that can find new meat spouts very quickly (which would be like temporary watering holes, causing animals from all over to converge and fight over the meat).

*** That's a fascinating idea.

With intermittent growths, you've got boom-bust population dynamics. Things that are small and can reproduce rapidly do better at first. Rats are more immediate than dogs, insects more immediate than rats, and bacteria most immediate of all. I'd expect that sea to be /full/ of flesh-eating bacteria--no chance I'd even go near it. The locals' immune systems either resist the bacteria, or they die. Maybe the fresh meat itself has an immune system.

In any case I imagine the carnivorous equivalent of an algal bloom; hundreds of small fish underwater (piranha, crustaceans, worms), insects at ground level (ants, flies, wasps, and especially [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermestidae][demestidae beetles]]), and birds (crows, magpies, vultures, seagulls) above that.

The piranha will turn on each other when meat grows scarce. Birds will eat insects, as will lizards and other medium-scale predators that happen by. You may even get bears paddling in to get a quick bite.

Check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_fall][whale fall]] for some idea of what it might look like--that's where a whale carcass descends into the deep ocean and causes an ecosystem to grow around it. Also there's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYbAwulg5zw][Scishow episode]] about it, which talks about how sulfur-loving bacteria change the local ecosystem entirely.

In fact...

All that tiger flesh is going to have implications for the chemistry of the sea. The water will be iron rich--bog iron would abound in the wetlands surrounding the sea. There will be toxic sulfurous clouds, and depending on how the flesh rots there might be large anoxic zones that kill most fish and crustations that enter them. Nitrogen and phosphorous will cause actual [[https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms][algal blooms]] that are also quite deadly.

Despite all that, water draining from the sea will leave very fertile floodplains. Between that and the iron, humanity will want to settle nearby--but perhaps not too nearby! Humans living there will need some way of determining whether river water is full of flesh-eating bacteria on any given day, or maybe they'll need to boil all the water as a matter of course. Maybe mats of disgusting bacteria, rotting flesh, and dead animals wash down the river periodically. The locals will notice that, and have traditions and protocols around it.

I've got to say, I really like this tiger island idea.

*** Is there exposed bone underwater? I'd expect any fish that can eat meat would have a much larger presence near the skull.

Birds would likely live inside the skull and do a lot of the picking clean.

If any small carnivorous mammals somehow got to the skull they'd probably flourish, but I don't know how they'd get there to begin with. Maybe by humans.

Humans might be the only ones who could break the bones, they might use it as an easy source of material. Bone marrow is edible and highly nutritious, and an untapped resource, so there would be a lot of incentive to try to find a way to access it. Maybe wooden pipes would be inserted into holes so it won't heal correctly?

**** Thanks for your reply, I really like the idea of humans using tools to harvest bone marrow, or inserting impediments into the harvested bone that are held in place as the skull heals. Given how I'm viewing the bone's healing ability as really strong, I'm not sure it wouldnt push out or crush any inserted pipes, but it's a really interesting avenue to explore.

*** I think the result will be very gross.

While you are correct that animals will pick the meat clean in the first week or so, once the flesh is exposed to the elements the entire skull is going to develop a massive, unholy staph infection that dribbles pus down the skull like wax from a candle. Any animals that try to eat the meat once it starts to fester will get a bad case of gastroenteritis (with explosive vomiting and diarrhea) and either die of dehydration or learn to leave the island well enough alone. Eventually, the fish will evolve to deal with the enterotoxin and start nibbling on anything accessible from the waterline, but for the first century or so you're looking at a giant pus-covered rock in the lake where nothing dares go.

Eventually, the pus is going to decay and form a oily sludge that accumulates around the skull at the bottom of the lake. It will experience outgasing and hideously scented bubbles of foul gas will periodically glorp to the surface, startling both fish and fool. (You would /have/ to be a fool in order to fishing in the lake, as by this point it would be completely undrinkable for the ambient level of bacteria in the water.) Eventually the entire thing gets covered by a shallow mound of muck. At this point there's a massive die-off of the staph and after century number two you get what's basically rich (if disease ridden) swampy soil where lakeshore plants can grow. Frogs, snakes, shorebirds and other animals will frequent the island as will a wide variety of bugs. Mushrooms will be very common, but mammals will probably avoid the place, as it's too swampy. Nobody wants to sink neck-deep into the staph-sludge, particularly once the beetles and worms start exploding in population size.

One hopes that the tiger cannot experience this happening. It would not be a happy kitty.

** I have, at the moment, three or four different multiverse stories in varying stages of development, and have been trying to work out some basic principles of how to make an enormous variety of cultures and histories without it being incredibly draining and/or revealing a lack of depth. Obviously if you're going to have a hundred worlds in a story, you can't (or wouldn't want to) spend hours on hours with each of those worlds, figuring out all the normal detailed worldbuilding stuff.

The way that I think of it is that if you go into any major American international airport, you'll see dozens of different people of noticeably different cultures, especially if you sit around for long enough to listen to them talk. If you're doing a multiverse, then you need to capture all the differences between people, and make it really feel like they're from different worlds.

The options, as I see them:

- Planet of Hats. Not preferred, since real places and cultures aren't like that, and it's the kind of thing you would only include for the purposes of mocking, at least nowadays. It's helpful if you have a television show or short series though, because you can just instantly 'get' a place.
- Groupings. People do this in the real world, grouping different cultures together and then sometimes pretending that they're the same, or similar enough for different policies and procedures, or for pragmatic stereotyping/profiling. It's also helpful in that you can broadly define tech level groups, governance groups, ethnic groups, etc., and it'll be easier for the reader to have a handle on, especially if you make concept handles for your different groups.
- Power law focus. 20% of worlds are responsible for 80% of the impact, so focus on that small sliver of worlds that are the most important. Depending on how your multiverse looks from a broad view, it could be that there are two or three worlds that are of extreme importance, those worlds that are at one end or the other of some distribution space. This helps to make a wide, diverse multiverse more understandable, because you can focus on the main players.
- Fake depth. Reference things that don't actually have any background, steep everything in mystery, don't inform the reader of what they're being shown, mostly so that you don't have to do all the work. You need to explain those things that are important to the plot or characters, but you can offhandedly mention weird dishes or strange customs without having to make up the entirety of the surrounding culture. I think this is probably the best way to go about it, or at least an important part.

I'm not sure that I'm looking for tips, necessarily, just thinking out loud about how to make a (non-infinite) multiverse more manageable, with applications for singular worlds with a wide variety of intermingled cultures.

*** I feel like this is definitely a series of thoughts I've had before, but, like, about an RPG that I was going to run. I think in a novel you can let your needs inform the decision, yeah? Like, you can't control where the party are going to go (or rather, you can but...) in an RPG, but in a novel you are driving the train, so you only need to worldbuild what you can see from the tracks.

Like, if I'm putting a multiverse into my story, I'm doing it for a reason. Maybe I want a cowboy and an astronaut in the party, or maybe I am putting some heat on the bad guy (If we don't do something...the Bleakness will swallow every hue of the rainbow of worlds!). That reason will tell me how deep I need to go in my worldbuilding.

I guess I'm nodding towards 'fake depth', but only in the way that everything in fiction is 'fake'. Like, you know all the stuff that is going to happen, so if you need to go into depth on one character's backstory at some point, then flesh that out. But if you aren't ever going to have characters talk about something, no need to waste your time writing notes nobody is gonna get to see, yeah?

But if he misjudges how influential something is, or just doesn't do enough to make the new stuff fit within the established, he could end up with a story where people aren't using resources that should be available and known to them, or fail to take countermeasures against things that are introduced later. Not a big problem if the story is reasonably short, but could be annoying to deal with if it goes on for a while. I've noticed a few minor instances of this happening in WtC.

*** I think all of these could probably work in combination, with a nod to the fact that the "hats" in Planet of Hats are stereotypes and there is diversity within cultures.

Edit: Like, not every Viking is literally a warrior, indeed a majority aren't. But their culture does very heavily value warriors and they're the element of society that had the most interaction with outsiders (via raiding parties). So they're a "warrior race".

But occasionally you'll meet Norse traders, fishermen, slaves etc, and if you actually visit their homeland you'll obviously find a whole society with of details you can't just extrapolate from their hat.

Actually, a good rule of thumb might be that each culture gets a minimum of two hats. Vikings would get labelled as warriors /and/ sailors, for example.

*** A dirty trick to for illusion of depth is to have flawed in-setting methods of simplifying the material. Your groupings option sounds like the best candidate for that - people in-setting group cultures together, but the groupings are transparently not very good at explaining things and riddled with exceptions, because the truth is more complicated. The truth might actually be fairly simple, but you've shown that it's more complicated than something, it'll always be anchored to that comparison.

Real-world cultures are composed of layer upon layer of subcultures. Just demonstrating that someone's outlook is informed by a subculture of their culture is enough to hint at a much richer world. Even if you're full on Planet Of Hats, you can have two Proud Warrior Race Guys bounce off each other because one's from the meticulous care of weapons subculture and the other is from the always recite heroic epics subculture. And subcultures really are much less nuanced than full cultures.

Planet Of Hats works a lot better if you do Planet Of Hats And Scarves. Or is it Planet Of Mismatched Gloves? Whatever, what I mean is you pick two stereotypes. You get something more original by default since there are more pairs of things than there are things. And you're more likely to be able to come up with something relevant to one of two cliches in a given scene than you are for one, so you don't have to have Worf compare scanning a nebula to combat just to give him a line.

The 80-20 rule applies to which subcultures of a culture are going to be relevant to the wider world. American Evangelical Christians are more important to world politics than American Roman Catholics, despite similar numbers. Subcultures are less nuanced than their parent cultures. You might find that everyone you ever meet from Sirius VII is a cutthroat slimeball, even though the planet itself is a fully nuanced world with a rich history (off camera), because Sirius VII Space Shipping has a toxic corporate culture and is also the primary reason you run into Siriusians off their planet.

Looking at two extremes:

Option A: "Here are 100 cultures, and 1 fact about each of them." This feels shallow, and gives the impression that you have sacrificed depth for breadth.

Option B: "Here are 3 cultures. Watch as I render these 3 cultures in an incredibly high level of fidelity. See how deep these three cultures are? Oh, by the way, there are also 97 cultures that exist, and I'm not going to tell you anything about them except that they exist." The audience now sees that you have explored several cultures in depth, and will trust that all of the cultures yet unseen have just as much depth as the cultures you have shown them directly. And indeed, that is an expectation that you can make good on: every now and then, you can pull one of the 90+ unused cultures out of the toy chest to play with them for a bit, and the number of cultures that are rendered in high fidelity will gradually increase. Even if you pull one culture out for a short episode and only have time to render it in low fidelity, the audience will assume, "Oh, there's some greater depth to this culture that we just haven't seen yet, and if this culture ever comes back, surely we will get to explore some of that depth rather than just seeing it Flanderized."

#+end_quote

Part of this is going to be how good you are at "off-handedly" mentioning things, but off-handedly mentioning something runs the risk of appearing shallow in a way that makes readers assume everything else will also be shallow. I recommend taking the approach I described above: pick one or two things and render them in /super/ high fidelity, then say, "oh by the way, dozens more things exist in this category, and all of those unnamed examples exist with exactly the amount of depth I spent describing that one thing." As an example, rather than off-handedly mentioning weird dishes, I would recommend having /one/ dish which is described with an exquisite amount of detail in a way that informs us about a character we care about (and ideally progresses the plot), then allow us to infer that all of the other dishes that exist in this culture must exist with the same level of detail.

If you really want something to appear deep, you have to show how /fractally/ deep it is. Which is to say, even when you zoom in a lot, you shouldn't run out of things to talk about. e.g. Meat is a category that includes beef, pork, fowl, etc. Pork is a category that includes chops, tenderloin, spareribs, and shoulder. Pork tenderloin can be roasted, baked, or grilled. Grilled pork tenderloin can be flavored with teriyaki, chili, or barbecue. (And let me tell you, my dad used to make the best chili-flavored pork tenderloin out on the grill in the back yard...) Keep peeling back the layers and show just how deep you can drill down on any part of these, and people will come away thinking, "Well, I only really got a detailed description of one kind of pork, but I assume that other varieties of pork exist with the same level of fidelity, and this leads me to believe that pork is a category that contains a lot of depth, a depth that is also probably matched by other meat categories like beef and fowl."

By doing that "deep dive" on pork tenderloin, you can also show how the categories exist in relation to each other, rather than having a list of 50 random and seemingly unrelated bullet points on a "list of foods that exist on this planet." People like putting things into categories, and subcategories, and sub-subcategories: it gives everything a context that makes it feel relevant to a larger cultural framework, as opposed to a loose factoid that isn't evidently relevant to anything in particular.

"Importance in the grand scheme of things" matters a lot less than "importance to the lives of our characters." For example, in the grand scheme of things, London is a city that is a lot more important than my home town. (My home town is of barely any cultural relevance.) However, if you were to write my biography, you would spend a lot of time talking about my home town, and very little time talking about London. While London is /objectively/ important, it's not really a part of how I subjectively experience the world, and any story told from my subjective viewpoint is probably not going to pay much heed to what's going on in London. Heck, you might read my entire biography cover-to-cover and never even encounter any /mention/ of London, despite the fact that London was a global center of commerce at the start of the 20th century.

I'd worry less about how important words are in "objective" terms and more about how relevant they are in the context of the story you are trying to tell. There might be a town somewhere with a population of 50 people, but if that happens to be the hometown of one of your main character, maybe that small town matters more than a city of 9 million people.

** On some planets we've found plant-equivalents that have nervous systems. They can follow a simple library of rules to determine which of their organs (flowers, leaves, nutrient storage, etc) to grow where. Most of these plants have much larger libraries of possible features to grow than would appear on a single Earth plant.

On one of these planets, there was a highly successful genus of large grassy patches with thorny bushes, which stumbled onto carnivorism via a pitcher-plant like adaptation and started eating large herbivores, lost all competition from anything that wasn't each other, and rode that calorie surplus plus internal competition all the way to sentience.

So, the Shepherds are sentient 300-square-meter patches of grass, with various organs. The Shepherds can apply some force at joints of their sticks and at the bases of their blades of grass, but these "muscles" get tired very quickly (like a venus fly trap gets tired quickly). For fine manipulation, they use a modified shrub structure. Bare leafless sticks form a scaffold dome, and more sticks drape across this and into the dome as "fingers." They position the scaffold to move the fingers to move the object they're working on. Growing a scaffold structure takes most of a year, so they can't be too specialized, but most Shepherds grow more than one. Scaffold structures can't be much more than a meter tall though; they're not trees. (And no, they can't just grow more brain. Growing more brain just means having the same thought twice at once, badly.)

The Shepherds have invented a style of sled that can be moved with just their grassy appendages. They use a large comb the same way to groom most bugs off their grass (and into their mouths). They can add pulleys to their scaffolds to lift heavier objects, like tools, and drop them for force.

So far, so paleolithic. I'd like the Shepherds to be space-faring. How do they get there?

(And does anything during that time affect their outlook by the time you run into them as a rival in a 4X game?)

*** The first order of business is trellises (cybernetic scaffolds made out of sturdier materials, allowing a Shepherd to grow into shapes that their biology would not ordinarily support) and monjolos (a sort of water-powered hammer, which takes a stream of water from a reservoir and uses its downhill flow to produce an up and down hammering motion). Together, these allow the Shepherds to craft much more intricate tools. Critically, the trellis allows for objects larger than a meter across to be assembled, while the monjolo allows for a single strenuous lifting of water to be parcelled out into several hours of repetitive hammering or turning.

The next big thing is the wheel. Instead of using a sled to move objects along the Shepherd's surface, you plant a baby Shepherd onto a wheeled cart and have it push itself along the ground using a monjolo hooked up to a wheel. These become a sort of warrior-merchant-aristocrat caste, similar to the bronze age warrior-priest castes. They're still planted in soil (which is held inside the cart), but they've grown up around a series of mast-like trellises which lean out over the sides of the cart, twig-covered limbs draping down like construction cranes.

This cart caste can't build as well as a flat caste, but it can project force and carry messages. The more flats a cart has supporting it, the better its equipment and the better it does against other carts. This probably leads to a feudal system with a Cart King ruling over Cart Lords who offer up levies of well-constructed carts (who serve as both warriors and mobile labourers) in exchange for protection against neighboring kingdoms.

If there are any animals which can be domesticated as work animals, they will be domesticated now if they haven't already - a cart pulled by an animal is swifter than one who pulls itself and is still fresh when it arrives at its destination. Getting livestock for food is more difficult, as most of the things a Shepherd would want to eat (insects, variously sized herbivores) are difficult to keep in an animal pen when you the farmer happen to be made out of edible foliage and are also the animal pen at the same time. Fortunately, there's a solution to that: aquaculture.

If a Shepherd is planted around the rim of a small pond, and is given the requisite trellises to reach over and into the pond as needled, it will be able to farm fish inside the pond and plants which the fish can eat around the rim of the pond. When naturally occurring ponds are all tended, new ones can be dug by the cart caste (at great expense - digging deep holes is a lot of work) in exchange for a cut of the fish. More practically, you'd run out of gardening space before you ran out of room for fish, so instead you'd have some Shepherds growing in long rows in order to maximize their available gardening space, with the understanding that they can trade their garden produce (which isn't directly edible) for fish.

Fire is tricky when you're made out of wood, but it's also required for both metal working and chemistry. The most likely solution is that the cart caste will plant specialist flat castes out in the middle of nowhere and make them conduct any dangerous research projects (including ones involving fire), with promises of food and other material rewards if they are successful Eventually, one of them figures out basic metal working and the cart castes are born into trellises of bronze with clockwork manipulators of frightful dexterity. Iron will be more difficult and will likely require a specialist caste who lives suspended from a crane inside a pit quarry. But iron and steel follow in turn, allowing for still better trellises to be built.

At some point, the idea of having multiple lesser castes share a trellis will be devised, intertwined with one another as to allow greater productivity. No doubt it will be met with horror at first, but it'll be too efficient not to adopt - anyone who refuses for moralistic reasons will get left behind by those with fewer compunctions. The net result is that industrial era cities for the Shepherds are great greenhouses of steel and glass, full of intricate machinery and sprawling worker vines, watched over by rolling blade-armed overseers.

Eventually fire gets introduced to the common factories (too expensive, keeping it restricted to the experimentalists out in the wilderness) and something like an automobile gets built, using steam power and later electrical power (which is generated using steam) to make the cart caste even stronger and faster and later on to make the factories work without the need for open flames.

From there, the progress toward the space age converges with our own. They make rockets (first for military reasons, then for communication satellites, then to explore space) and send up cart caste astronauts alongside some flat castes packed into the walls of the ship (nobody would agree to go to space without their slaves). Whatever it is that you expect Humans to need in order to develop into a proper 4X faction (FTL and laser weapons, doubtlessly), the Shepherds also develop for much the same reasons - they too want to go fast and zap people with lasers.

Overall, great villains, totally stealing them.

**** As far as their society goes, they'd have an appalling number of slaves, be very much into cybernetic technologies (they invented those before they figured out fire, after all), use more vehicles than infantry in their military, and be impossible to remove from a planet without genocide.

***** I'm following the MOO1 model for most things, so all ground wars are genocidal anyway. Horrible, but it keeps the game moving.

I like the idea of making ground wars slower (span multiple turns) with Shepherds involved. I don't think that's a benefit or a detriment, it's just weird.

**** Wow, these are some great ideas!

Trellises and monjolos are a great idea, those really open things up.

I don't think that being planted on a cart would be healthy - it'd be hard to build a cart large enough for 300 square meters of soil. They could survive smaller if they ate enough meat, but that's even further away from their ancestral nutrition than when humans switched to a mostly grain diet. That's not going to stop them, but I don't think cart-dwellers end up being a high caste.

I don't understand how to use a monjolo to propel a cart.

Planting individuals in industrial contexts opens things up a lot. I think that fills in the gaps I had about how they get through their industrial era.

More guns and less lasers in this setting, and no force fields. Discovering FTL requires space telescopes outside of orbit. Humans discover the FTL effect when Kepler II starts having attitude control issues after a series of black hole imaging experiments. I carefully picked a set of conditions that don't contradict any experimental evidence, but the rest is of course hand-chosen to be as convenient as possible.

Well it's a 4X, so they're only as likely to be villains as anyone else is. They're not as warlike as the Artenids (evolved from pack-hunting squidbirds), omnicidal as the Bestrons (once like a parasitic vertebrate-eating hermit crab, now entirely mechanical), insane as the Humans, or as much of a late-game terror as the Nebulons (goofy looking stork-like things that evolved to sentience to better distinguish novelty in the baubles they collect for their their nesting displays).

One advantage the Shepherds have is that, since they can survive on photosynthesis alone (although adding meat would be healthier), they can sustain about 10x the population that, say, humans eating plants would. On the other hand, they can't fit in small spaceships.

***** I had been under the impression that the surface area requirement was largely solar based and that as long as you had 300 square meters of sunward facing surface area, the soil requirements could be met with a root ball and regular food/water. Instead of a 10m radius circle or a 15m by 20m field, a trellis would let you occupy the lateral surface of a 4m by 25m cone. While individually they might be weaker, they could concentrate forces and pick five- or even ten-on-one fights vs field-bound Shepherds.

For the cart, you'd use a [[https://qxf2.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/crank_animation.gif][crank]] to convert the reciprocating hammer motion into rotational motion along the wheel's axle. Or, once they get the idea of making a specialist design for cart propulsion, by hooking it up to a water wheel directly.

****** Yeah, 300 square meters is solar. I don't think that playing with surface shapes gets any more density though - grass already absorbs all the light that gets through it. The only improvement I can think of is using a slanted surface so they can rotate around to face the sun more of the day.

You're right about the combat advantage of mobility. They'd probably take over despite being somewhat sickly. I think that'd swing in favor of more traditionally planted Shepherds once they invent guns (I imagine they use mortars); carts would fall apart after the first round of shelling.

The thing I don't understand about monjolo-powered carts is that a monjolo is river-powered, and a cart moves.

******* You make your own 'river' using two water tanks and a channel. When the upper tank empties, the Shepherd uses a pulley to pour water from the lower tank into the upper tank. In human terms, this is very slow. But in Shepherd terms, it is infinitely faster than what anyone else can do.

As far as surface areas go, the big thing isn't making it more dense so much as allowing you to make your surface be vertical instead of horizontal. Just like it's easier to move a mattress if you turn it on its side, it's easier to move a Shepherd if it can be tall instead of wide.

** Imagine a binary star system containing a red giant (large bright star) and a brown dwarf (small dim star) with an alien planet in an [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Planets_in_binary_star_systems_-_P-_and_S-type.svg][S-type]] orbit around the brown dwarf. This plane has an orbital period of a roughly 16 Earth-years and a rotational period of roughly three Earth-days. As a result, the inhabitants experience an eight Earth-year long "summer" where they experience day-round sunlight and temperate climates alternating with an eight Earth-year long "winter" where the entire planet freezes over for lack of solar warmth.

The native life has developed a cicada-like life cycle, where creatures live for an entire (eight year) summer before laying extremely durable eggs (or seed pods, or spores, or whatever other form of durable larval stage you care to invent) that are expected to survive through the winter and hatch during the next thaw, completely isolated from the prior generation. Your species, due to meddling precursors, has been uplifted to sapience and gifted with bronze era technology, but has not been removed from this environment. What's your plan for ensuring the prosperity of your progeny, given that they won't come out of their eggs knowing how to read and you can only leave them supplies that will survive being frozen for eight years using only bronze era technology?
