[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6agtna/biweekly_challenge_fanfic_grabbag/][Last time,]] the prompt was "Fanfic Grab Bag", and our winner was [[/u/arenavanera]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6agtna/biweekly_challenge_fanfic_grabbag/dhervca/][their untitled Unsong story]]. Go read it now!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time the challenge is *Low Budget*. Prose fiction doesn't actually have budgets, so pretend that you're writing a short story that's intended to work as a pitch for either a short film or indie movie on a shoestring budget. You don't have money for much in the way of special effects, CGI, etc., you can't have that many locations or expensive props, and you're probably not going to be able to spend that much on costuming. If you want to write a screenplay rather than prose fiction, this would be the perfect challenge for it. (If you think that you can shoot and edit a short film in the next two weeks ... well, good luck, and I'd be interested in seeing the attempt.)

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, June 7th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge is *Gods*. You are free to take this in whatever direction you please, whether the god(s) in question are literal or metaphorical, whether they're actively present in the story or merely discussed by the characters. If you're writing a story that involves a real world religion, try not to be a dick about it. In issuing this challenge I'm largely thinking about Scott Alexander's work (examples [[http://unsongbook.com/][A]], [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][B]], [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/][C]]).

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 6/7.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6dehpl/challenge_companion_low_budget/][can be found here]].

*** That was amazing. I really liked the logic puzzle - it was legitimately challenging, but not so much as to be unsolvable. The ending also plays off very well with the setting.

*** Not the biggest fan; but still well done.

I was hung up on the single-demon problem; that's probably my bad.

But I also don't trust people's memories. I mean, if you had everyone assign their belief in their memory's accuracy, the coffeeshop and the rally would be of suspicion. Pvetre shows strong belief in the existence of Veera, but Ashley only has a (relatively) weak belief in the existence of Pvetre. And Ashley <-> Tom and Josh <-> Graff, so I would have picked Pvetre.

I also didn't anticipate the rector having planted the demon months/years before, but that would only invalidate the photo of Veera.

**** That's a fair point. I've had this problem before too; it's surprisingly hard to put a logic puzzle into a story without it having out-of-band solutions you didn't think of, and it's hard to present the information for the logic puzzle in such a way that it's 100% trustworthy.

*** That was rather interesting. I was drawn in quickly; I love reading about logic puzzles, though I'm admittedly not that good at solving them. I have two questions, one I'm sure you can answer and one you may not want to.

1. Is it possible for us, as the reader, to figure out who the demon(s) was with only the information the test takers had?

2. Who was the demon(s)?

**** It isn't possible to figure out with 100% certainty who the demons are with the information the test takers have. If you grant the assumptions Graff mentions (most importantly, no human conspirators and no demons planted months before), it still isn't possible to be 100% sure that you've identified all the demons, but it's possible to identify Ashley and Tom as demons. The real trick, though, is noticing that the Rector didn't actually say that you pass if you correctly identify a demon. He just says that "the test is over" in that case. (Ashley misquotes him to try and trick everyone into holding a vote, because the "correct" answer is not to hold a vote at all.)

One of the things I kind of dislike about this story is that there are a bunch of clever things stepping on each other's toes. I think if I were doing this again I would pick one clever thing to be the "answer" (probably either "there can be more than one demon" or "the correct answer is not to vote"), change the statement of the rules to be more clear-cut, and remove ~2000 words.

***** I loved the story, but I agree that the "dual clever answers" kind of clashed. Like, it was cool to figure out that Ashley and Tom were demons, but ultimately made no difference in the end (other than to allow Graff to impress the rector); they could have figured out the waiting part either way.

If the test /did/ end in success when all the demons were found, then (a) the focus would have been on Graff's deduction abilities, and (b) it would have allowed Graff to locate all possible demons (after Ashley and Tom are voted out, if the test didn't end, they could have had Graff and Josh vote for Pvetre and Veera vote against).

*** That was pretty interesting, I liked it.

One question though: What is Graff's name an aptronym for? I assume it's a reference to Colonel Graff from the Enderverse, but I don't quite understand why.

**** A graph in the CS sense ([[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/course/Cs163/Graphics/graph4.png][http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs163/Graphics/graph4.png]]). When I was first writing the story I had him drawing graphs on the board while he was explaining things, but I cut that because it was too hard to draw in non-monospaced ASCII art. In retrospect I probably should have considered renaming him at that point.

****** Yup. The in-universe explanation is that Demonologists used to be extremely careful about who they taught, but were forced for political reasons to lower their standards for entry to the Demonarium, so they ostensibly admit a large number of people and then select the most impressive ones to get an actual education.
