Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** Next to you is a button saying "press to restart the 2010s", per [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e3mcuh/you_awake_on_112020_next_to_you_is_a_button_that]]

You press it right away, ignoring the obvious ethical concerns, and suddenly find yourself mentally time traveled approximately 10 years back. You find yourself in a safe condition(ie not actively driving), but are otherwise dropped into your body and world of ten years past.

It's obviously easy to greatly profit off this situation- buy some Bitcoin, get the jump on alexnet, crispr and Uber... But you should be able to do better, influencing world events for the better. What do you do?

Obvious considerations: getting people's trust, lack of recent memories from ten years ago, lack of time to prepare before going back, potential governmental attention

*** Is it against the spirit of the question to use your knowledge of that button's existence? In a scenario where the button is only there to set up the premise you probably wouldn't find it again. It still seems like something worth checking in the first three months or so of the reset, since you can then make more detailed observations for a subsequent restart.

Again, you'll probably be ignoring some ethical questions by dedicating a restart to observations, and there's a chance even if you find the button that it won't work again, so it would probably be worth pressing at the five year point. By then, you won't have affected much, so even if you can't reset again you'd at least have clearer memories to draw from for the upcoming five years.

Priorities if you can restart multiple times include preventable natural disasters (early warning on forest fires, for example) and whistleblowing for organisations that were exposed for wrongdoing in the future.

So if Bill Gates is concerned only with "improving human life on Earth" and you ascribe moral patienthood to animals where he does not, then there might be areas where earlier technological (e.g. accelerating in vitro meat development) or political action could have outsized effect

Mind you, I'm not actually sure how to /do/ that.

I don't know how much of a price difference there was between 2010 and 2013 in bitcoin but if it's significant, I should be able to get in some kind direct contact with Trump by 2013 which could be enough to stop him just by chance. Everything else I would do to stop him from winning would probably be mundane campaigning.

I have a terrible memory, so I don't think I would be able to prevent any major catastrophes, because I don't know when they happened. Maybe the Boston marathon bombing? I don't remember what year that was, 2012 maybe? Calling in a tip the night before might be enough. I think I would call every year from 2011 to 2015 to be safe, hopefully they don't start disregarding it. Or it could scare the perpetrators off to begin with. I could probably stop Andrew Hussie from getting scammed by the King's Quest guys, though. Oh, and was pepe already a thing by then? Maybe I could talk to Matt Heely, who made the comics, and try to reduce the online presence of his comics to prevent that phenomenon. It's likely to be replaced by something equally bad, but at least it'll be different.

I mean, I'm not trying to be mean but these seem so... minimal. 2 and 3 are practically negligible in the scope of a decade. The current presidency, despite the doom and gloom, has not hardly been the foreign policy apocalypse people were concerned it would be. Trying to get a candidate with a demonstrably aggressive foreign policy would be tempting fate.

Frankly, the biggest difference in global economy you could make off the top of my head is to consolidate money and influence for a few years and start campaigning against Brexit, considering the big loss in global GDP that gridlock has caused.

***** They're definitely lackluster, but it's about as much as I think I personally could manage. I think stopping Trump being elected is still pretty good, mostly for the cultural effects because that's what affects me more than the political effects. Definitely changes the tone of the second half of the decade.

I'm not a Brit so I wouldn't feel great about interfering with their government, and I don't find a stagnating GDP emotionally compelling. I also might not have ever thought of Brexit before you mentioned it, so it'd be difficult to do anything about something I didn't remember.

Also, I'd use excess funds for philanthropy but that's not going to be particularly influential. Oh, and hopefully I'd remember about the existence and actions of ICE and start up the movement against them again, in case that doesn't become a political issue of the year this time around.

** Crossposting [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e2h85n/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/f8xr76p/][my question from this week's worldbuilding thread]] since it straddles the line between worldbuilding and munchkinning. (And because I posted late and missed most of the boat in that thread.)

Summary: the Shepherds are a species of sentient alien plant. They're about 300 square meters of grass, have a pitcher-plant like mouth, can also grow twiggy branching structures up to a meter tall, and have weak "muscles" in the bases of their grass and branches of their twigs. Their muscles are weak and get tired quickly, like a venus flytrap's. They can shuffle large, light objects across their grass. They can build scaffolds of twigs to perform fine manipulation. A healthy diet includes meat, soil, water, and sunlight.

What can the Shepherds do to get into space?

(There's one good answer in the linked thread, but more would be helpful to compare and contrast against.)

*** Unlike humans, each individual Shepherd has an effectively unlimited capacity for fine manipulation. They should be able to work on many different things at once. Their primary weakness is immobility, as this will make it difficult for them to prospect and mine vital materials for a space program.

To solve this problem, a large patch of Shepherds could cooperate to move the soil underneath them aside and dig themselves into an open pit mine. Plants are very capable of breaking rocks of arbitrary hardness apart with their roots, so hitting bedrock won't be a problem. They could keep feeding and watering themselves by cycling soil from the edges back through, and draining the pit isn't a problem because they are their own pump system.

Digging a mine this way would probably take centuries, but with a large enough area of Shepherds they could strip mine hundreds or thousands of miles of terrain without expending greater individual effort. I assume their needs for meat would be met by peripheral Shepherds doing actual shepherding, and the depression would feed them more water than they ever needed. They could perhaps trade their abundance of water and vital nutrients from pulverized rocks for meat and revitalized soil, making the whole enterprise worthwhile for everyone involved.

Identifying ores shouldn't be that hard. Plants can already produce and identify a surprising variety of pheromone-like compounds, so they definitely have chemical identification capacities. Some researchers have even posited that real plant colonies might have some kind of sapience, though I don't personally think there's enough evidence for that. The Shepherds could eat into chunks of ore the same way they would normal rocks, then note where the resulting mineralized fluid is building up in their systems.

To turn that fluid into a workable material, they could break off their reservoirs of fluid, dig a huge clay-lined hole, drop everything in, cover it over somewhat with more clay, then set fire to it through any number of means while pumping chunks of coal or even oil in on top. They might be able to keep that process going indefinitely, and they could figure out the layers different metals separated out to through trial and error by poking sacrificial roots into the crucible. Then they could build clay casts for whatever metal pieces they need and pierce the crucible underground to fill them. Their enormous degree of fine manipulation means they should be able to make really solid molds, and they could make that manipulation better by making thin metal rods to manipulate rather than twigs.

Once they have a forge, they can start an industrial revolution pretty easily. With thousands of square miles of mine they shouldn't run out of materials. Industrial waste should be pretty easy to handle, as their workers literally cover the entire work area and all personal injuries short of total annihilation are recoverable. Just shovel waste products into clay ampoules using manipulators you intend to sacrifice, then pass the ampoules across the surface to some safe dumping ground. Climate change could be a problem, but these are sentient plants. More Co2 in the atmosphere means they can grow more thickly and so sequester more carbon.

Once you have an industrial revolution, you've basically got everything you need for into space. Each capsule can probably only contain one Shepherd, hydroponically fed and carefully folded over itself to save volume, but each Shepherd can do the work of dozens of humans. The capsules could have mechanical protrusions containing multitools, so creating a station would be as simple as launching a bunch of capsules with varying materials and passing them out to assemble in space. Landing back on the planet is easier for them than for us, as they could bleed off speed by descending a little bit into the atmosphere and extruding sacrificial roots or blades to create a gigantic surface area. It would be kinda like deorbiting a massive cotton ball with even less density.

All in all, this would probably take thousands of years from the beginning of the first mine to first orbit, but given that the Shepherds are basically in a post-scarcity economy anyway due to the fact that most of their needs can be met with zero effort on the part of other Shepherds, it should be doable.

**** Great answer! I especially like the idea of trying to take advantage of roots for mining, and I like that your version didn't assume they can manipulate things with roots.

Criticism takes up more room than praise; I'd like to emphasize again that I enjoyed your response before we dig into the much longer nitpicking portion of this post.

#+end_quote

Their muscles tire very quickly, like a venus fly trap's, so their fine manipulation is rate-limited by fatigue unless they grow multiple redundant manipulation structure. Those take up space, and they only have so much; they still need to photosynthesize. Also humans haven't ever been bottlenecked on availabile fingers. And I don't think the Shepherds necessarily are great at multitasking; most decisions they have to make in the ancestral environment are about where to grow what, which is not very time sensitive.

As a setting conceit, /every/ sentient species went through a phase where they can casually obtain a huge calorie surplus. This includes when humans evolved the persistence hunting strategy. I wouldn't trust being a carnivorous plant to maintain post-scarcity any more than being able to kill more gazelles than you could ever eat made our society post-scarcity. For contrast, you might enjoy [[/u/grekhaus]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e2h85n/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/f8zc9c6/?st=k3m9n3t7&sh=091f1f24][answer in the previous post]], which includes much more Shepherd to Shepherd cruelty.

***** Because the Shepherds can roughly manipulate all of their grass blades, they can direct the motion of small packages across their entire surface area. Fatigued paths just don't get used until they're ready again, and adjacent paths can take up the slack. That's why I said they have effectively infinite fine manipulation, as they can pass projects along to new patches of grass as the old ones tire. 300 square meters is a ton of space to pass small things through.

I was assuming the Shepherds behaved something like a hive mind because real-world plants do that. All rooted plants known to exist have a deeply interconnected network of [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza][Mycorrhiza]] which massively increase the surface area of their roots. These symbiotic fungi aren't particular about which plant, or even which species, they connect to, so entire forests are usually connected into one mycorrhizal network. Plants are known to send chemical messages to other members of their species and members of other species through this network, so communication and interdependence between adjacent Shepherds should be quite extensive. It is this network which makes some researchers think plants might be sentient. They look and behave awfully like nerves.

For the deorbiting suggestion, I was thinking the falling Shepherd could turn themself into a massive dandelion seed. Parachutes are good at airbraking, but they aren't the only effective design. Air resistance depends on surface area lateral to the direction of acceleration, so any design which maximizes for that will be effective. Once they slow down enough, they could crack open the capsule shell to increase their surface area even more while trailing even more extruded fibers to plop back to land with minimal injury.

*** Are there de-aging potions in DnD? If so, I would set my undead servants on brewing them, then dole them out for free to my living ones. I would only ever need a fraction of an undead servant per living one to keep my entire kingdom healthy and young, and I could recruit new undead servants from anyone who tried to attack my people. I would put a hard cap on the number of undead servants I could control, well below the the theoretical maximum, and like the author stated in the thread I would have implanted myself with a cyst so I could use Suggestion to maintain my obsession with following the flowchart.

I would have put a limit on expansionism. Only invade kingdoms which attack me first, only kill soldiers you can't avoid killing and subdue the rest of them with cysts where able, using Suggestion to keep them peaceful only long enough to end the conflict. After winning, anyone who does not wish to recieve the cyst is allowed free passage out of my kingdom, but may not live in it. Outside visitors are allowed, especially for purposes of trade, but zero adventurers who refuse to take up the cyst are allowed. Nobody without a cyst may stay for longer than a week or however long it will take them to cross my kingdom to their destination, whichever is longer. Anyone who took up the cyst may ask to have it removed at any time, though they would then be required to leave the kingdom the same as anyone else.

If I ever stumble across someone else using this trick or any other which gives them the capacity to observe through and potentially control massive numbers of people, I would require them to adopt my flowchart for themselves or else declare immediate war on them. I can't risk someone who didn't think to create a flowchart with this kind of power, and I won't be able to tell which parts of the flowchart are vital and which are acceptable deviations.

I will send ambassadors out to neighboring nations, but will not allow any into mine. However, my ambassadors will be required to consent to allow themselves to be temporarily puppeted by me (for no longer than two hours at a time with at least 30 minites between periods, no longer than six hours in a single 24 hour period, and no longer than 30 hours in any 7 day period). I will make it known that ambassadors being puppeted are me, and speak with my full authority. This way neighbors can make treaties with my kingdom without ever sending a delegation to it. Any of my citizens may also give revokable consent to be puppeted in cases of imminent, life-threatening injury, and I will not puppet anyone else unless imminent danger to myself or the kingdom may be so averted.

Any living soldiers of mine would be required to consent to puppeting, though I would never puppet my command staff. Any commanding officer who told me not to puppet their subordinates would be promptly obeyed, as soon as I could make sure said soldiers wouldn't immediately die due to my compliance. Anyone who could remotely be considered an advisor would be unable to consent to puppeting.

I would never, under any circumstances, have sex with anyone who has taken up the cyst. If I found I needed satisfaction, I would hire prostitutes from neighboring kingdoms. I would put a hard limit on such behavior, though, and would pay their usual rate in addition to travel fees, with de-aging potion as an additional gift.

That's all I can think of right now.

Edit: Any advisor who has been chaotic good and in my service with zero questions about their loyalty for at least fifty years may suggest additions to the flowchart. Such additions must be ratified by 2/3rds of all other good-aligned advisors. I set it up this way because chaotic good advisors are only ever likely to ask for more rules in the case of blatantly obvious flaws in my system, and whatever they suggest must also seem a good idea to lawful good and neutral good advisors. A true neutral advisor with absolute veto power will be appointed to ensure no suggestions are contradictory or in violation of other obvious legal principles.
