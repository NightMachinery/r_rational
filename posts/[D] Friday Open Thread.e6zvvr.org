Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Often a common theme in fantasy rational or not is that the MC has some level of motivation that is higher than others. I'm trying to translate that into real life for myself because I have such a hard time moving forward. Does anyone have any rational ways of dealing with motivation? I used to use my depression as a driving force but it's stopped working lately and I'm on meds to make sure it doesn't come back anyway. How do you keep doing stuff when you feel lost or inadequate?

**** Thanks I'm working on 13 right now. I used them to distract myself during panic attacks and minimize the feedback loop but now they're adding to my stress. I haven't heard of 2 but everything else was on my radar to at least some extent. Thanks for the confirmation and support.

**** - Use conditions: Can't do X until Y is done. This one is really OP, specially if you really can't do without X.
- Change word usage. Use 'Want to' instead of 'Have to' and 'Get to' instead of 'Got to'. This improves mood and motivation.
- Make rules and laws for yourself and follow them. And respective punishments if you don't. If you're naturally lawful or conscientious this helps a lot.
- Somethings can only get done if you allocate time into them. i.e writing, getting ideas, planning..
- Statistical thinking can be less helpful than positive thinking if you're doing difficult (unlikely) things.
- If what you have to do is uncomfortable (upsets your stomach) the less thinking the better. Pre-plan the task and do it when the time comes, if you start thinking then you will likely procrastinate. Helpful if you're asking for a raise, or asking somebody out..
- Checklists are OP and you should use them for everything. Checklist Manifesto is a great book.

*** A few bits of advice, not really a cohesive thing:

You can only have so many top-level priorities. Maybe three? Society generally expects you to prioritize more things than can be prioritized. You have to ignore some of it to be a healthy person.

Taking care of yourself needs to be really high on the list of priorities, especially if you're prone to any kind of depression. Even if you're off trying to save the world, you probably should put things like eating, bathing, exercising, and sleeping on schedule higher on your list. Naive trade-offs against self-care don't work because slacking off on self-care chains together.

Even if you have a goal that you're intrinsically motivated about, you can't do that thing all day every day, or even all day minus self care. We're not built to do that for more than a few days in a row. One helpful way to maintain long term motivation is strict time-boxing: work on your thing for a set period of time every day, but just as importantly, /don't/ work on it outside of that period. You want that feeling that you really want to cheat and work on your thing outside of the time box, because it means you still want to keep working on it.

*** I posted on this topic [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/748okf/meta_positive_lifestyle_changes/dnwl7vk/][awhile back]] and it was moderately well received. The short answer is that you need to find something meaningful to you and pursue it. The hard part is that you have to bootstrap your way to getting there, either by dealing with issues you already have or trying things out to see if you find them meaningful enough to continue. You might try [[https://80000hours.org/][80,000 Hours]] if you're looking for a group that is trying to commit themselves to a version of the good.

*** I'd recommend taking a look at the book Lost Connections. There's a lot of research showing conclusively ssri antidepressants and most antidepressant medicine are a really ineffective treatment for it and even then they don't last.

​

There's also a lot of research into things that actually help with it. It's really annoying what big pharma did with depression medication and how they sold the world into their bs.

** This is probably better meant for Wednesday World Building thread, but it's a little late in the week to post there and I definitely won't remember my questions in time for the next week's thread.

In cultivator novels, there are spirit stones or something similar that every cultivator can use to either advance their cultivation/power levels or as a form of currency to trade for resources. They also often have the cultivators be able to create the spirit stones (which would cost qi and if consumed at 'full' qi reserves, it advances power levels).

My question is that is there any economic literature, articles, or books on how the laws of economics function when people use currency that can be produced by any single individual member of a nation? Does counterfeiting still make sense as a concept? How does supply and demand for spirit stones work if large sums are constantly being produced and consumed all at once versus a normal central government printing a nation's currency? How does it work when currency has an alternative use outside of trade? The only thing similar is when gold was often used as jewelry outside of trade, but it's not similar to how spirit stones aide in personal development.

The only thing that seems similar to our world is if there was an economy that used food as a currency and I definitely didn't find any such wacky cultures in my google searching.

I would also appreciate it if anyone can suggest cultivation novels that delve deeply into investigating these questions.

*** To me it seems like such spirit stones wouldn't be a simple currency; they would be a resource in and of itself. Since creating them requires effort, spirit stones would effectively be crystallised labour, which can then be used by someone else to advance their power level. So I think that works just fine, it's like any other economic good. The only difference is they're not scarce in the sense in which, say, gold is scarce, so that the work a gold hunter would do looking for it is also limited by the amount available in the environment. However, labour requires time, and in this case probably something to accumulate experience (like monsters to hunt), and both time and monsters /are/ a scarce resource.

So they're not forging currency, they're mining it. Not unlike Bitcoin, with the notable exception that the only usefulness of the work that goes into making Bitcoin is that it allowed the Bitcoin system to exist (which is why it's liable to end up as a bubble), while the work poured into the spirit stones can be reconverted into useful work at any time. It's like buying empty batteries, hooking them to a bicycle generator, recharging them by pedalling for a day, and selling them back charged at a surplus.

*** To my understanding cultivators are typically depicted using the bartering system with monster/demon parts, pills, armor, tools, weapons, formations, knowledge, and the like up for trading.

Spirit stones are like one use battery packs that refill you when Qi is low or when your Qi pool needs to overfill to break into the next realm. It's used as bartering material because having lots of battery packs is a plus while having no or too little battery packs is bad in a potentially life threatening situation or when you need your Qi pool filled fast.

I have no idea how economics would work if anyone could potentially make their own currency. Never read anything that went into the subject either. Bad if the currency isn't regularly and quickly taken out of circulation. Good if... I have no idea.

Counterfeiting

I think counterfeiting would be used as a weapon. Like the reason Spirit stones (SSs) are used is because they are neutrally aligned and don't have any drawbacks. I could see tainted spirit stones in circulation crippling or harming cultivators long term and short term cultivation wise and or health wise. Either messing with an enemy nation's cultivators or messing with an individual in a trade deal. (It would of course be very bad news if someone was tainting SSs and the person in question would very likely get lynched by a host of cultivators.)

Supply and demand

SSs as a resource is typically produced in vast quintiles in many places and could potentially be artificially produced if Qi was concentrated in a limited enough area. Though the artificial SSs are just an idea of mine and I don't believe I've ever seen them in a story. Something close though is sects and clans making formations to draw in the surrounding Qi and making a Qi rich area to cultivate in or to grow resources in. Anyhow demand- the demand for SSs is pretty so so with cultivators sometimes not taking them as payment. SSs are used when in a trade with two parties, one doesn't have cultivation resources (CR) (artifacts, monster parts, pills) while the other does have the a CR needed by the other party or has a service that the other party needs. SSs are used to supplement the lack of CRs or services the lacking party cannot provide. The bulk of trade is in CRs and services.

Currency as a consumable

When a currency is a consumable.... I got no idea. The thing on the forefront of my mind is "Hope it doesn't run out". Doesn't really apply to SSs as CRs are the bulk of the economy in low tech and high tech cultivator stories. Though in high tech and low tech stories the good toys are powered with SSs and not CRs.

One thing of note is that cultivators sometimes have to deal with mortals and as such could potentially have various currencies and precious mortal materials (metal, gems) on hand.

*** The best examinations of spirit stones as a concept I know of are World of Cultivation and Forge/Threads of Destiny. That isn't saying much though. FoD uses them as an excuse for xianxia mechanics in the fundamental magic system of the setting, and are otherwise just stones you can mine in certain sports that don't have any elemental aspect to them. WoC makes it clear that an x level spirit stone represents y average cultivator hours of work. The high end sects have techniques that let them absorb spirit stones with high efficiency, and when a new cultivation system is (re)discovered, people have to find new sources of spirit stones of that type.

*** Either things stabilize and production and usage balance itself or there's inflation or deflation until taking the time to make the currency isn't worth it or becomes so beneficial everybody does it for a while and gradually stop as the value changes.

​

Google ROI, and Opportunity cost. Making this currency would be for the most part a low opportunity cost thing, the time of a powerful or influential cultivator could potentially lead to much better returns than making coins for a few hours, they could make elixirs, equipment, teach novices, have expeditions to acquire resources..

​

It'd likely be akin to mturk for cultivators.

** So I've just read a series of papers by Swiss physicist Nicolas Gisin which I found philosophically pretty interesting:

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06824.pdf][Indeterminism in Physics, Classical Chaos and Bohmian Mechanics. Are Real Numbers Really Real?]]

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01497.pdf][Time really passes, science can't deny that]]

[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08300.pdf][Collapse, what else?]]

These are various musings about the determinism vs. free will, and why the author believes in the latter without necessarily believing in dualism. The argument that struck me the most here is the one that Newtonian classical mechanics are, really, not deterministic at all. The logic goes like this: pretty much any system outside of ridiculously simple toy models is chaotic. Chaotic systems have infinitesimally small information encoded in their initial conditions become macroscopically relevant at long times. Therefore, in order for the future evolution of, say, a system of three bodies orbiting each other to be fully determined, their positions at t = 0 would need to be encoded by real numbers. But real numbers contain an infinite amount of information, and we know that there is a limit to how much information you can pack in a certain volume of space before you get black holes. Bringing QM into it doesn't significantly change the argument because wavefunctions and Hamiltonians still use real numbers. Hence, there must always be some intrinsic randomness due to the universe having limits on, well, numerical precision - just like any computer simulation. He doesn't mention space-time being discrete, but that seems the obvious next step in logic to me.

He then makes an interesting argument that rationality and scientific thinking are only possible in a context in which free will exists. It goes like this: in order to falsify a theory, you must be able to choose which experiments to perform. If you can't choose, then you performing the experiment, and the outcome of it, could be part of a grander, ridiculously complex law. You can never be sure what would have happened if you did not perform the experiment, or what happens when you do not, because your performing or not performing the experiment is as necessary and sure a consequence of the laws of nature as everything else. Basically, you can't rule out superdeterminism, therefore the scientific enterprise is completely moot. I don't think he's wrong there, but then he makes a step saying that the scientific enterprise is actually meaningful, /therefore/ free will must exist, and that seems more like wishful thinking to me. Or perhaps he just means the alternative would make our own lives and work entirely meaningless, so we best work in the assumption that it's not the case, or nothing really would matter anyway.

In general, though, they're fun and interesting reads, which don't require much specialised knowledge. I'm not sure how even proving that randomness is an inevitable part of the laws of nature would then translate into "free will" without some kind of mind-matter substance dualism, but it seems at least an interesting thought to explore. At the very least, something I do like is the idea that quantum collapse is an objective process. I lean towards that sort of belief myself, though I can't discard Many Worlds either. Copenhagen though is just handwaving and pretending the problem doesn't exist.

It seems to me that he's conflating rules that apply within the universe, such as the Bekenstein Bound, with rules that apply to the underlying reality (whatever that may be).

If I created a simulated universe and imposed a limit equivalent to the Bound within that universe, that wouldn't mean that the numbers I used to represent the simulated universe would be subject to that same limit. That argument should apply to our own universe as well.

If there's some sense in which everything is pointless because it's predetermined or whatever, then it's also pointless to worry about the pointlessness, so IMO we shouldn't.

That would only work if that additional information stayed hidden forever, which it doesn't. If the information contained now within a sphere of 1 nm of diameter will be relevant in a million years to the configuration of this entire sector of interstellar space, then that information /is/ real to the universe, and part of it, and thus should obey the Bekenstein Bound. What you're saying applies more to stuff like hidden variable theories of QM, where we hypothesise there is a "true" value for observables, we just have no way to know it to enhance our predictions beyond the Heisenberg indetermination limit.
