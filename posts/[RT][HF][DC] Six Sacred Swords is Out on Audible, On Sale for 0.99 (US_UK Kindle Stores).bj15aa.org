Hey all!

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1][*Six Sacred Swords*]] is my latest novel release, and it's currently on sale for 0.99 on the US and UK Kindle stores to celebrate the launch of the audio edition of the book.

For those of you interested in the audio version, you can find it [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Six-Sacred-Swords-Audiobook/1772309117][here]].

The novel focuses on the adventures of Keras Selyrian, a powerful swordsman who begins a quest searching for the legendary *Six Sacred Swords*. Stylistically, it's tremendously inspired by Japanese games like *Final Fantasy*, *Dragon Quest*, *Ys*, and especially *The Legend of Zelda*. It's also very light, comedic, and optimistic in tone, with a protagonist that leans toward non-lethal combat resolution when possible.

*Six Sacred Swords* is a spin-off/prequel of my *Arcane Ascension* series, the first book of which is [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/][*Sufficiently Advanced Magic*]]. It also serves to connect the *Arcane Ascension* books with my [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKFFR36/][*War of Broken Mirrors*]] books, and has some characters and elements from those as well. You don't need to read any other books to understand this one, but you might understand a few additional references if you do (similar to how Sanderson's cosmere books work, or Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, etc.)

Compared to my other books, this one focuses more on dungeon crawling and adventure. I mentioned *The Legend of Zelda* as the strongest influence because there's less political stuff here than I usually write, and more of a focus on just traveling around and dealing with strange new places and creatures (whereas my other books probably lean more toward the *Final Fantasy* side of things).

In terms of rational elements, this book contains a fair bit of lateral thinking and non-standard problem solving methodology (although not quite to the same degree as my Arcane Ascension books). It also deals with some ethical issues that are relevant to the genre and has some deconstruction and reconstruction of general fantasy and GameLit/LitRPG tropes. Finally, it has a hard magic system with clear rules and world building connected to that. The book is a lot shorter and lighter in tone than my Arcane Ascension books, though, and doesn't get into the same level of general analysis.

I hope that people enjoy the book if they decide to check it out!


** I have been excited for this! On the last book of travelers gate, then diving into this

** So I am in the middle of reading On The Shoulders of Giants. Would you recommend I finish that and then start this?

Also, if it wouldnt bother you too much, what is the War of Broken Mirrors about? It sounds like the Lightbringer series from just the title

Yeah, I'd finish that first, as long as you're enjoying it. There are a couple things from the end of OTSoT that are relevant in small ways.

WoBM is a little more of a Western RPG style, rather than a JRPG style. It's also multi-perspective rather than focusing on a single character.

The first book follows three characters in the city of Orlyn, where the local gods claim to be able to raise anyone to divine status if they earn it through sufficient service.

The three perspectives are:

- Taelien, a wandering swordsman with a powerful weapon he can't properly control. He's searching for answers about his heritage, which may be divine in origin.
- Lydia, a court sorcerer for the city of Orlyn. Minor spoilers since this is revealed very quickly, but she's actually a paladin from another nation investigating the claims of the local faith.
- Jonan, an illusionist and spy from a nearby country, who claims to be investigating the disappearance of a group of children.

There's a stronger component of intrigue to these books than my other novels, and they're generally more serious in tone. It's hard to say if an Arcane Ascension reader will like them, but they're in the same universe.

** I'm really sad that you wrote a spin-off right in the middle of the final book. Could you please just focus? I want to see what happens to Corin!

*** Arcane Ascension is more than a three book series, which is why I'm taking a break (and planning to take more breaks). It was originally planned to be six books, and I expect it to be at least that many, if not more.

I'm glad you're excited to see more of Corin - and there'll be plenty more of him in the future. =)

Thanks!
