** Thank you for linking this.

I'm the author of this story, and I'm glad to see it here because it's quite heavily indebted to the rational fiction genre, and in particular the rationally writing podcast. I'm not sure I could in good faith classify it as rational, as the story starts from a deeply irrational premise. However, I've tried quite hard to have the protagonist react rationally, within normal human bounds, to what is a deeply absurd and irrational situation. That tension seemed interesting to write about and hopefully to read.

This is the first serious attempt I've taken at writing, and I can't claim to be particularly good at it, but I've got no intention of stopping, even if there may be breaks at times (hopefully not as long as the first hiatus).

** I wanted to share this here since the author is posting again after a hiatus. It's one of those rare RoyalRoad gems with good grammar and an interesting premise, so I'm pretty excited to see it active again, and I'm hoping a boost in traffic from you folks might cheer on the author and help keep it alive.

​

Esper: Search for Power is a LitRPG story with a standard setup; our boy is given superpowers and yanked into another world to level up. It has a few refreshing little twists, but it's new enough that saying much more would be a spoiler.

​

Things I like about it, and things that set it apart from others in the genre:

- The protagonist doesn't take unreasonable, unnecessary risks for the sake of power
- The protagonist doesn't forfeit his humanity for the sake of power
- What luck the protagonist has appears to have an explanation
- It doesn't /appear/ to be moving toward a cultivation-style, every-man-for-himself clash of powered civilizations

*** Hmm, sounds good. I'll give it a try soon. I have review debt to that fiction that I'm impressed with, so I can't read this right away. Meanwhile, why don't you tell us about these:

1. Can we, as readers, feel characters has motive and read in the works they actually work toward it?
2. Do the antagonist or obstacle are actually competent or worth a struggle?
3. How's the worldbuilding? I personally tolerate single plot hole every 10k words. Pretty tolerant, I think. But I absolutely despise fiction that betray its premise: you can't say A is true at the beginning without A stays at least partially true at the end.

**** 1. Absolutely. There's a pretty clear goal in sight, and he's established a more sentimental one for himself. So far, basically everything has been for the main goal, but once the story finds its pace I'm sure the second will become more trying.
2. Uh.../sorta?/ It's extremely important to emerge victorious, but there's no single, clearly defined enemy to overcome, and he hasn't had any super close brushes with death yet. It's less like a breathless sprint to get to a gun before a murderer, more like digging people out of a collapsed mine. Hard, dangerous, but maybe not quite as risky or thrilling? (I'm not selling that well.)
3. So far it all seems internally consistent. One author's note mentions an edit to fix "a continuity goof", but otherwise I haven't noticed any problems, and at least he's not shy about editing to fix his mistakes.

**** I am intractably biased as the author of the story, but here are my answers to your questions (minor spoiler warning):

1. I certainly hope so. At minimum I've done my best to create a protagonist with clear goals and the intended primary thrust of the story is about his decisions and analysis of how best to reach them.

2. The stakes are very high, so in that sense I think from the perspective of the character they are unquestionably worth struggling to achieve. On the other hand, I could see where readers could justifiably view them as somewhat forced or artificial.

3. This seems to address both world building and plot cohesion/following one's own rules. As far as the latter goes, I've worked hard to keep things consistent except where there is an organic in-universe explanation for the inconsistency. It is very likely that I will at certain points need to go back and ret-con a few details however. As far as the world building, I don't view that as a particular strength, but I've done my best to create a world with a set premise (perpetual monster attacks, which is a minor spoiler), and then think logically over how that would impact and shape society economically, socially, technologically (kind of), militarily, educationally and in shared values. It's still early on in the story though and most of that is still to come. So perhaps call the world building a work in progress?
