** Glad the story's back!

And wow, that first chapter is /on fire/. I was worried Ana would be stuck in this weird "impersonating Tunnel Vision without any of her personality traits" plan, glad to see this is /not/ the direction we're going in.

I can't wait to see more!

  So I continued, going off-script. “I told you my true identity for a single, critical reason.” I took a deep, slow inhale. “You're not like Commonplace, who wanted to reshape this country. Or the Shenti, who wanted revenge.” My voice turned cold. “All of you care about money.”
#+end_quote

This was already strongly implied in previous chapters, so it's nice to get an explicit confirmation.

Does that make sense, though? The turnover rate in Tunnel Vision's gang is /high/. In the last book we kept seeing mobsters armed with handguns get sent in fights against people who crushed armies for breakfast. At one point TV set up a trap with dozens of mooks made to wear copies of her body, and everyone involved probably knew that none of the body doubles would survive the night.

If the mobsters were purely in it for the money, you'd think most of them would have deserted by now.

(Then again, maybe the higher ranks really bought into the ideological side of it, and now that they're dead the survivors are the greedy types that didn't get promoted)

#+begin_quote
  A flash of light and a peal of thunder rang out from inside the room, then darkness. Stun grenades. Other explosives shot out of the flying humans, blowing out chunks of the roof. The figures shot down into the building, punching holes in the top.
#+end_quote

Huh. Paragon uses non-lethal force now? That's new.

Maybe they're hoping to interrogate prisoners.

#+begin_quote
  “Well,” said Left-Hira. “I'd say that went well. Though I still think the whole idea is whale.”
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what Hira was hoping for. Did she really like the idea of running a prostitution/gambling/heroin operation that much?

#+begin_quote
  I took a slow, deep breath. “This is Anabelle Gage,” I said. “Calling from Grace Acworth's body.”
#+end_quote

Wait, is the henchman they sent to connect the lines still there? That's sensitive intel she's revealing.

(though they could have told him that guardians would be hunting down the payphone, so he needed to get away fast)

#+begin_quote
  “And even at her greatest heights,” said Brin. “Anabelle Gage was never capable of taking you on.”
#+end_quote

Well fuck you too, Brin.

#+begin_quote
  “It's a ridiculous story,” I said. “But it's true.”
#+end_quote

Eh, it was okay, honestly. Lots of dramatic tension and everything.

#+begin_quote
  “And even if they believed it was you,” he said, his voice crackling. “You never got a pardon. There's still a warrant out for your arrest. Rogue projectors are seen as a threat.”
#+end_quote

"Really, it was mostly your fault. All you had to do was win a three-way fight with your two best friends and condemn them both to a life of homelessness and you'd have had the pardon, conditional on living with a psychopath who would mind-rape you if you ever disobeyed her. Can't imagine why you didn't do that."

#+begin_quote
  I turned off the radio. On the other end, my subordinate would hang up the call, set up a timed memory wipe as a contingency, and leave, on the off chance they'd traced his payphone in that short time. But I doubted it.
#+end_quote

Wait, he /was/ still there?

That raises so many questions.

#+begin_quote
  Parliament had made it official, but the newly rebuilt Conclave of the Wise had made the real decision, and would be overseeing the day-to-day operations of the war. A hybrid government, they called it.
#+end_quote

/Glances at Myanmar./

Greaaaaat...

#+begin_quote
  “I got us into this mess,” I said. “I got us to break into Ronaveda's home. I made that radio broadcast and incited the whole country against the Shenti.”
#+end_quote

Honestly, it was just a question of time. Declaring a war on Shenten was always going to be the most convenient out for Paragon, especially once Cao Hui revealed himself.

#+begin_quote
  “And,” I said. “I helped Wes back into Paragon. Got him mixed up in this Egress conspiracy madness.”
#+end_quote

I mean, I don't see a future where Wes wouldn't try to get back into Paragon, and Tasia was barely trying to win at the end, soooo... not really your fault either?

Honestly, this arc should be called Messiah's Complex, not Impostor Syndrome.

#+begin_quote
  She'd made copies of the pages, and individual letters, then tried to read them far away from the original book. Everything she could think of. But nothing worked. Nothing cracked open the secrets inside. The Shenti had already tried those gimmicks for The 99 Precepts, and they hadn't worked then, either.
#+end_quote

I wonder what form "it doesn't work" takes, especially for the "letter-by-letter" part.

Like, at some point you're just copying everyday words that are in a bunch of other texts. Does the block keep you from understanding the block exclusively if the everyday words were copied from the blocked text? At some point the censored information would be indistinguishable from regular information, though?

Maybe the block lets you copy one word at a time, but it doesn't let you understand the words in relation to one another?

(but seriously, I like all the worldbuilding with the Spirit Block)

#+begin_quote
  “Remember last year? Around your birthday, when you worked yourself to death? And you turned into a bitter, desperate fuckwit with no morals. Though you kind of did that year-round. [...] Now, you're a bitter, desperate fuckwit with a functioning moral compass.”
#+end_quote

We found Pith's tagline, everybody!

#+begin_quote
  Vice-Captain Glenham bowed, not breaking his smile. “I look forward to our business relationship.” Then he straightened himself. “Now, what can I do for you?”
#+end_quote

What a nice person who's perfectly fine working for the person who murdered his boss. I'm sure he'll be a perfectly trustworthy ally!

#+begin_quote
  The dorms, with the tiny bunk beds where we and the crew would sleep. Hira and Tasia and I didn't get our own room.
#+end_quote

This is a terrible idea and they'll slit your throat.

#+begin_quote
  “Ah,” said the Vice-Captain, with a knowing smile. “We run on an electric motor when we submerge! If we used the diesel engine underwater, the sub would fill up with toxic fumes!”
#+end_quote

Ooh, foreshadowing!

#+begin_quote
  “And projectors?” I said. “What happens if a Joiner gets close and starts tearing holes in our hull?”

  “I barely know how to swim,” I said. Hira was giving me lessons, but like many things, I was not a natural.
#+end_quote

Ana, please stop reminding the self-interested mercenary whose colleagues were almost all violently killed or arrested about the inherent danger of working for you.

#+begin_quote
  “Excellent questions, madame,” said the Vice-Captain. “I see you are possessed with a keen mind.
#+end_quote

Yeah, he thinks you're an idiot and he's humoring you so you don't think too much about how out of your depth you are.

(hehe, depth)

#+begin_quote
  “And in Shenten?”

  The Vice-Captain's smile cracked. “We have enough fuel to get us there.”
#+end_quote

"I am, of course, perfectly fine with you taking me into a war zone after my aforementioned colleagues were all violently killed or arrested."

#+begin_quote
  “With these specs, and these capabilities, it was likely one of the former Tunnel Vision's most expensive possessions. If you weren't using it, you could sell it for a solid fortune.”
#+end_quote

The fact that Ana and Hira don't pick up on /that/ hint kind of underlines how much they don't know what they're doing.

#+begin_quote
  Not a boy. And not Wes, either. Tasia. Still had to get used to that.
#+end_quote

Wait, so Tasia still identifies as a girl? I guess she could be like Wes where they don't care either way.

#+begin_quote
  “And Sarah found an insight for my work,” Tasia said. “It's impossible to destroy a Null Particle. That's why they keep building up in the Piths of old people.”
#+end_quote

Sounds like a waste disposal problem.

Except, judging from previous chapters, the waste is portals to the Cthulhu dimension.

#+begin_quote
  Tasia shook her head. “Tasia Ebbridge wasn't all that admirable either. She bowed down to a cruel mother who expected the world of her every day. She fought on the side of immoral people.” She hunched over, making herself small. “And she couldn't save her friend, Kaplen, from one of the worst fates imaginable.”
#+end_quote

Tasia, I appreciate that things are hard for you right now but this is /the exact opposite/ of what Ana needs to hear.

#+begin_quote
  “Let's talk about the only thing anyone gives a shit about.” The radio host burped, finishing a glass. “The Shenti. Parliament's declared war on the eastern dogs, and I say: took them long enough!”
#+end_quote

This chapter has a lot of horrifying stuff, but this is easily the most disturbing of all.

"Well, I don't have magic honesty or any incentive to tell the truth, but I have alcoholism and that's basically the same, right? Also, ignore the fact that everything I say conveniently props up the agenda of the new government. I say it in a really crass and callous way, which is also equivalent to honesty."

This is way too real. Both the naked racism and the corporate cynicism of rebranding a show that was known for the personality of its host with a completely different host, agenda and only superficially similar mentality.

#+begin_quote
  Good. If they were here, they might try to stop me.
#+end_quote

Oh no. Ana, what are you doing?

#+begin_quote
  Akhara's Gate crackled before me. A strange, twisted artifact that even Grace didn't understand. That killed nineteen of every twenty that tried to shape it with their minds. My life was disposable. With Hira's codes and passwords, Tasia could easily take my place as Tunnel Vision.
#+end_quote

Ana, /no/. Bad Ana. Step away from the suicide gate!

Holy shit, I didn't realize from the earlier text that she was down that bad. Though in retrospect I guess she got hit by a lot at once.

#+begin_quote
  I pulled a pen and notebook from my bag, ripped out a page, and scribbled a note on it, then dropped it on the floor. Tasia and Hira would find it later. They would be heartbroken, but they would understand.

  I'm sorry. I stepped forward, towards the portal.
#+end_quote

Holy shit. This is... wow.

Side note, this chapter /definitely/ needs a trigger warning.

#+begin_quote
  He made a calculation. Decided that it was less dangerous to betray his new bosses, steal their submarine, and pawn it off for a fat stack of cash. Stabbing us in the back was more profitable, and less risky than diving head-first into Shenten.
#+end_quote

Yup. Same thing Tattletale discovered.

The main problem with hiring cutthroat mercenaries after killing their former boss is that eventually, they'll decide it's time to betray you too.

#+begin_quote
  /The crew doesn't have guns./ My stomach sank. The Vice-Captain must have smuggled some on. Or stolen one of Hira's. Which meant he could slaughter the rest of the crew with impunity.

  The gunshots grew closer, louder. I slid down the metal wall, my vision growing more blurry, and the cracks seemed to echo in the distance, like I was watching the world through a dark, foggy tunnel. My lungs pumped, frantic, to no avail.
#+end_quote

See, this is what I meant earlier. Apparently, the crew is loyal enough to Tunnel Vision to rush a guy with a shotgun with nothing but their bare hands and a prayer, and die to the last man saving her.

If they're self-interested mercenaries, shouldn't they have ran away once they realized the captain had a gun?

#+begin_quote
  The man made of Voidsteel bowed to me, and smiled. His mouth opened, and he spoke with a light Nekean accent.

  “Anabelle Gage,” he said, his voice soft. “A pleasure to meet you.”
#+end_quote

Well...

Hum...

Okay. That's new.

** So, Ana's essentially created a power vacuum in the criminal underworld? I can get that she doesn't want to be a crime boss, and holds a grudge against some of them, but she's opening the door for a gang war here.

*** There's no power vacuum. Paragon is the queen bitch in town, and they're cracking down /hard/. Even before Ana dismantled "her" criminal enterprises, all her people were running scared from the Guardians. No one's going to fight a gang war when Paragon is arresting and mindfucking anyone that looks vaguely suspicious, especially when the public is cheering on the rising authoritarianism due to the one-two punch of Commonplace's failure and the looming war with the Shenti.

Don't get me wrong, there will still be crime, but there won't be wealthy mobsters throwing their weight around and warring with their rivals. Oppressive authoritarian regimes tend to have that effect.

**** If there's no one in charge, that's a power vacuum. Someone will rise to fill that void. And Paragon is fighting a war and sending its best overseas. They're going to be stretched thin on the home front, and they don't have the technology for monitoring everyone. Plus, their crackdowns are going to drive more people into extremism. Not to mention there are now a bunch of disenfranchised people of Shenti descent who have no job/stability and hate the Principality for turning on them.
