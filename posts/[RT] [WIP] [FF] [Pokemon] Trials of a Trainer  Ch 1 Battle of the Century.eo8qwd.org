I'm not entirely sure if my story would be considered rational enough for this subreddit, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway.

I'm trying to go for a more realistic grounded world.

It borrows heavily from Lamora's Game of Champions and several other fics.

** Here's a bunch of pokemon headcannons I have:

​

- It was mentioned that in the ancient past people made pokeballs out of berries which implies that they can be low tech. Some pokemon when they evolve shrink to a small sphere then expand in their new shape (does that actually happen? In some of the 3d games atleast?). So people would first launch a blowdart filled with a berry essence that would put the target unwittingly into a evolution state, since the conditions aren't right it'd just "evolve" into the same form, if it wasn't interrupted by someone putting a specially made container around the sphere that prevents the pokemon from rexpanding. The container would probably have an inner coating to keep the pokemon stable, perhaps another berry mixture? Carved everstone? Mirrors? This technology has of course advanced immensely, with advances such a signal projector instead of a dart, lucid dreaming with a psychically connected programable sim and stuff like that.
- The reason that many pokemon's calls and thus names are so appropriate is that the modern common language can be traced back in part to people imitating pokemon calls to refer to something similar to the pokemon, much like why writing looks sorta like the unown.
- Nobody actually knows what's up with the unown, least of all the unown themselves.
- The reason moves are limited in number is that pokemon need to grow new organs to use many of them like mini evolutions. This is why skitty can use thunder attacks.
- The language used in pokemon is mostly translated exept for that the words "evolution" and "metamorphosis" which are swapped.
- lamarckian metamorphosis works for pokemon which allows speciation to happen much faster.
- Pokemon fossils aren't fossilized like we understand it, they can put themselves in stasis and ended up buried. They've been in stasis so long they usually need a special machine to wake them up again.
- Humans in pokemon aren't quite the same mentality to us, they have an instinctive suitability to leadership.
- Pokemon are as varied mentally as they are physically and smarter/dumber isn't enough to sum it up, for example metagross is difficult to communicate with due to the difference in perspective, durants are about as smart as actual ants though have something of a hive mind and several rock types have no sense of time, waiting for a day as easily as a century.
- A population of rotom possessing the same things and deciding to stick with them permanently is the source of many modern modern pokemon types like klink.
- The golurk line is a case of this being done intentionally. Before civilization rotom possessed ore formations, this incidentally is the source of the metagross line.
- There are more rotom like pokemon of different types and preferred host items though they are rather strange, unpredictable and difficult to study, only rotom is civil enough to have a proper designation.
- A great many modern pokemon come from a sort of organic rotom in the far past, this is also why many pokemon are humanoid, some tribe wandering into a group of these pokemon or making a mistake while trying to train them.
- The definition of pokemon is an aura based lifeform, there are still non aura based lifeforms around but other than humans and most plants the biggest are about the size of a large bug, in this geographic area anyway.
- The first pokemon is considered to be deoxys which made or caused to be made mew. These created a great civilization but due to their high energy needs there are only a few left in the known world living near major energy concentrations. The legendaries are their own things but it's believed every group has their own unique origins.
- The true nature of Arceus and thus the world as a whole is unknown, the few interviews people have managed to get with the entity itself have clarified nothing though the answers it gave remain fascinating and people have spent years pondering the conceptual labyrinths stored in the psychic recordings.
- The civilization consisting of these region-states consists of a large series of islands but is hardly worldwide, there are many strange and glorious places if you go far enough.
- Battling is the traditional and most widely used test of a trainer but it's far from the only one and one that many argue is lacking, there are other formal and important circuits for the traveling trainer such as people competing to train the best team of Pokemon chefs or construction workers.
- There are many training principles and philosophies, for example especially among the higher tier trainer of more intelligent pokemon there is a belief that the trainer doesn't have a place in a battle and should stick to, well, training. Another is the trading culture where instead of carefully building single team to last a lifetime and every situation pokemon are rapidly shuffled around a group of trainers as circumstances dictate, these trainers are often looked down upon by more mainstream trainers but this is generally unfair to this legitimate practice. Frequently traded pokemon should be given far more leeway and independence than ones in more permanent positions for social and psychological reasons.
- Although the porygon pokedexes are destined to be a specialist tool there are designs with special rotom compatibility for general use, however due to the fact that rotom are almost universally unsuited to the role, which requires a mindset somewhere between secretary and clerk it seems unlikely to catch on majorly. The possibly of accidentally having them use the expensive and fragile piece of hardware to fight is another drawback.
- The achievement of creating the porygon line is an impressive achievement but if you look deeper it's creation is perhaps the single most important accomplishment ever. Porygon is a purely aura based pokemon and does not necessarily have a distinct physical form or location. Although it was built using the same basic principles and to be compatible with systems like pokeballs it is the only pokemon that can't be traced to the same origin as the rest, it is being argued that it shouldn't be classified as a pokemon at all. Porygon and porygon2 have very large yet very simple minds arguably not truly intelligent or even alive. PorygonZ however is most certainly both though not in a way even it's creators entirely understand.
- There are many pokemon with no designation or place in the training system, for example ones that have never been caught or studied, truly sessile ones, or ones that can't be trained.
- It's not uncommon for a high tier team to have several trainers, even outnumbering the pokemon, for example tactician, battle director, nutritionist, researcher, publicist and of course the trainer.

** I'm just reading through it now. A few small things: I think the Pokémon names should be capitalized, like Arbok. Also, I think it could do with a few more read throughs because of typos.

But overall, I'm quite enjoying it. I'd encourage you to think more about why things are the way they are in the Pokémon world. You'll get that a lot in this subreddit.

*** I dunno, it makes pokemon feel a bit more real if they're not a Character with a Capital Name like each one is an Important Individual. Better for them to be integrated into the language like dog or giraffe or cockroach.

** I've read 3 chapters now and I'm really getting into it. I hope you keep going with it. I'm enjoying the twists you did to the canon story line as they make more sense, and I'm digging the Pokédex entries too. Keep up the good work. I think you're striking a good tone, just keep to the world building! The characters seem to be getting established in their individuality, which is great.

** Typo thread?

Chapter 3 (I only thought about pointing these out during this Chapter. I might go back and revisit the older ones later if you don't mind?)

"Special designation is given to those trainers that have beat members of the Elite Four. *Fourth ring* has defeated one member; third ring has defeated two members; second ring has defeated three members; and *fourth ring* has defeated all four members."

Fourth ring appears twice. From the context, I'm guessing the second should be "First ring"

"The Youngster Act became dead in the water the instant *Aconite* ratified it"

Isn't Lance the Grand Champion at this point, and as such the one who'd ratify it?

"we never *+had ran+*"

Past perfect. If the To Have verb is in the past, the main verb (To run in this case) needs to be in the present.

"*+Padding+* paws echoed"

Padded

"Nevertheless, it doesn't *+whether+* you have Oak or Ketchum as your last name

It doesn't matter. Or keep whether and remove the "it doesn't"

"battling techniques*+,+* and species biology"

No need for a comma if you're following with "and (last part of the sentence). Actually, take this one with a grain of salt, I might be wrong.

*Other minor nitpicks*

A number of lines end in commas instead of periods. I do believe that even in the occasions where you end a line, followed by some minor narration and return to the same line, there is no comma you just don't use a period. Like here;

*"That is true,"* Davis nodded. "But we are starting..."

Inconsistent accenting in Pokémon. Sometimes it shows with the accent, sometimes it doesn't. I believe that for convenience sake, writers who aren't from a language that usually accent words just don't bother with it and no one sees problems;

Every letter in an acronym followed by a period. This is one is technically correct I think, but there is no strict ruling saying so. And actually, there is a push for using what is more aesthetically pleasing, meaning cutting the periods. Which also makes it more convenient for writers (coincidence, I'm sure).

** Ok, I've finally read all the chapters. Just wanted to encourage you to keep up the momentum. I do indeed get a good Game of Champions vibe from it. I like the relationship between Mimey and Red. I hope to find out more about the brink. Am I right to say that it takes place in a future history of our world? Gotta say, was sad to see that Red didn't start with Pikachu but I understand the motive.

*** I'm glad you enjoyed it. I wanted to try and mash together a bunch of different concepts/headcanons/ideas from different fics I've read over the years. Im a little surprised it fit together so nicely.

#+end_quote

Yup! You're right. It takes place in a post-post-apocolypse world where civilization was torn down completely and repeatedly over the millennia by pokémon coming through the Brink. Which there will be explored more later on in the story.

#+end_quote

I wrestled with this decision a lot, including debating about adding a Pikachu later on in the story, but I was afraid it might be too similar to Game of Champions if I did that. So I decided to go a different route.
