** Good chapter! Also, I hadn't understood from the previous chapter that the mystery author was writing novels in the real world that appeared in other fictional works; although it was said. Bad reading comprehension.

I take an issue with "neural networks can basically do anything", though. As =cio_ci= says, they can't as of yet write a connected story :)

*** Thank you :)

Regarding the neural networks, I did my research (for once), mostly by talking to a few CS students, though none of them were experts in neural networks specifically. If I understood them correctly, a neural network can theoretically solve a lot of problems (including writing a book) by applying what is basically pattern recognition. It's just not practically possible, mostly because a story is a very intricate and interconnected thing. The amounts of both training data and computing power required would be absurd. This is what Cio meant when she said "basically"; as a matter of theory, it's possible. Cio is studying mathematics, not computer science, which might explain her focus on the theoretical.

If there's anything factually wrong with what I said, please tell me. And if you still want to take issue, may I suggest blaming Cio's incomplete knowledge? While she's more tech-savvy than Mike, she's not really an expert :)

**** Well, theoretically, as the number of hidden neurons approaches infinite; a single-layer neural network can approximate any bounded function. And yes, one of those bounded functions is the map from a 100-dimensional vector to a story; but there are many practical obstacles to learning this mapping. There are fancier architectures that can do more things, but still.

Maybe you should say "theoretically" instead of "basically". I'm not a native English speaker so my experience of the word "basically" may not be common let alone universal; but it evokes in me that the concept is a simplification, yet still true in ordinary circumstances.

***** Edited. Thanks for the information as well as your opinion, much appreciated.

And for the record, I'm not a native English speaker, either. I always have to watch out for wonky word choices/grammatical constructs, which makes feedback like yours even more valuable :)
