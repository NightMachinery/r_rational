** All right, Rachel seems to have segfaulted into the Crayak/Ellimist database. That last scene...I'm not sure what exactly it means, but those definitely aren't Rachel's memories, Rachel had no idea that Ax is Helium now.

Note that she hears Marco speak in ten voices, and there's a bunch of morph clones of him running around. Also note that Cassie is in that scene, and if dead Rachel is still in the cloud to be downloaded, it implies that Cassie is, too. It might be that she stumbled into the area where /everyone's/ memories are being stored. Certainly seems to have done a number on her, either way.

Sleepy time.

--------------

That's probably the most optimistic interpretation possible; it means Garrett's alive and they have the cube. In the context of what the avatar said, "The whole point is for you to be put in situations where your decisions are philosophically relevant...", it's interesting that this vision involves V3 offering the kids some kind of choice, with the boys all agreeing and Cassie trying to stop them.

** Well, fuck. Telor sacrificed themself. Wow.

I was /not/ expecting that. At least part of them is preserved through Terra, but still. Wow.

And WTF is up with Rachel. Just like, WTF. Immune to prophecy, weird with the Chee, and somehow getting memories from both the past of this timeline and apparently some sort of alternate timeline... Is that a scene from canon?

I'd like to point out that Rachel shouldn't know that she'd "never see Cassie again" since she doesn't know that all the cassie morph-holders died, but considering how much she seems to know things she shouldn't like Ax->Helium that might actually be intentional.

The description lacks a mention of the ground connector, though (the small metal stick on each socket).

  I'd read somewhere that chess grandmasters are more likely to lose to a total novice than to, like, a chess blue belt, because the novices violate rules and expectations that are so fundamental and basic that the grandmasters have no way to anticipate them, no experience coping with them.
#+end_quote

I get the simile Rachel is making, but that's not actually true.

Novices in chess make very similar mistakes, that are very easy to capitalize on (eg they get their queen out too early, and put it in a position where it can easily be taken), and they are very bad at capitalizing on any mistake a grandmaster might make.

Also, chess is a game where the first ~10 few moves are extremely important and essentially determine how the rest of the game will go; a novice player will either do mostly random moves (eg getting the knights out before the pawns, moving non-central pawns first) or mirror their opponents moves, while the grandmaster will be building a strong position that will give them a lot of offensive possibilities.

AFAIK, the seismic sensors are reasonably likely in the quite near future:

No idea about that last flashback either but since Cassie is there, I think it might have to do with the alternate universes thing hinted at in the last chapter.

** Another great chapter. This one felt like it's own little movie, kinda Bourne-ish haha. Love that Rachel immediately works the problem upon waking up in an unfamiliar environment.

Curious about the seisure visions. I checked, and it doesn't look like old Rachel died in morph or anything like that, so I don't think it's purely morph tech behaving strangely. Plus the whole future vision at the end kinda rules that out.

Poor opsec on Tobias's part with the whole Koskinen thing, though I'm not sure what else he could have done. Good thing Koskinen underestimated them. I'm curious whether morph clones maintain the ability to blow up the cube.

Sorry the writeup is so brief, I just caught up on the new updates, need time to process. I may have more feedback to feed the beast later.

And finally, wrong chapter but too late for the original thread, the Marco death scene in chapter 37 legitimately made me cry. So good onya TK17

** Here's a fun thought: could a Yeerk infest someone without their knowing it?

Either

1. By destroying some of their memories before exiting the brain, or

2. By creeping into their head as they slept, then staying dormant, not taking any actions, only observing.

Of course, 2 would likely be comparable to paralysis. Humans don't have the willpower for it. But Yeerks might, particularly if specialized for such a role when created by their source pool.

Given the seizure, it's clear something is wrong with Rachel. This is probably an overambitious guess, but I wonder if this is not a true Rachel, but a Rachel constructed from interactions other Animorphs have had in their heads with her. That would explain the regular intrusion of imagined voices onto her inner monologue - particularly Marco. Perhaps the Ellimist is unable to model her in any other way, and he is responsible for this? Typically he would massage the resurrected backups to work better than they ought to, but for Rachel he cannot?

We really need an explanation for why the Chee can't see Rachel properly. And that has to involve either time travel, the Ellimist or Crayak meddling, or something beyond even those two. The last is my favorite. Some intrinsic weakness in the simulation process they use, that is then propagated to Chee-tech based on theirs? A choice of one participant to hide their own actions from their future self?

#+begin_quote
  Contempt, or compassion. Disdain, or admiration. I could feel the choice inside of me, the two potential paths, two blueprints of two very different Rachels, one impatient and cynical, the other empathetic and forgiving. I could be the sort of person who looked at Ante and saw only his naïveté, his insufficiency, his overall meaninglessness in the grand scheme of things---

  Or I could see the other thing.

  Porque no los dos?

  No. I wasn't strong enough.
#+end_quote

Good job anticipating my objection, TK.

#+begin_quote
  And then I realized that I was thinking---that I was thinking, the now-Rachel, the Rachel who was demorphing, who was right now in the middle of a seizure-vision, I'd never come awake during one before---
#+end_quote

Does Z-space exist outside normal spacetime? We could get some [[https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1936-borges-ahistoryofeternity.pdf][Borges]] situations going here.

No idea about the last scene's meaning. Maybe something to do with how Visser exists across z-space now? Some kind of Ms. Frizzle shenanigans where the Animorphs go the the Elemental Plane of Z to battle him in his own domain?

The concept of direction and distance seems alien to the Z-plane, as there are numerous simultaneous Z-plane users that never seem to have spacial overlap problems. The Z-space virus at least seems to have formalized a rule that you dont hit your targets in Z-space itself, you destabilize the targets that link to Z-space, using Z-space as a vector. That, at least, sticks to Z-space as a dimensionless void, not a place where you can directly physically find and whack people.

#+end_quote

My intent as author is that the first would be very difficult---a Yeerk piloting the brain is like a human operating a Mac or driving a car; some operations are very easy and others extremely difficult. It's much easier for a Yeerk to simply physically injure someone than to remove a specific memory. I'd expect removing a specific memory to be near-impossible (or like the sort of skill that Phillipe Petit has; a Yeerk could plausibly spend many many years perfecting the skill in a single brain, or something).

I believe the second would be hard because there's pain and damage when a Yeerk crawls in, but let's say the person was drugged or blackout drunk---then yeah, I think the combination of their ability to soothe away the pain signals without the person ever knowing that they /should/ be in pain, plus just lurking quietly in the brain, ought to do it.

I also think it's possible to have something like a very small shard of Yeerk in your head, that will trigger a simple action given a simple stimulus, but is otherwise essentially undetectable (except by something like cancer-sniffing dog).

But I do love the lament of the self-aware NPC. And I liked how you've captured Rachel's ability to explain her revelations, like the difference between saving Ante and giving him a life. It's a lot deeper tie to the spirit of canon than just the plot premise, and in this case, an improvement over when they'd meet some random kid in Alaska or Australia or whatever.

** Wait, 2023 as in the future? I'm confused. Apart from general "I feel like I would have noticed that by now", I have a memory of Marco giving the price of Bitcoin at a time that was past when that chapter was published. And I don't think several years have passed in-universe. Am I misremembering?

  “There was this guest speaker from America---she was meeting with some bigwig in Estonia and came up for the day as a personal favor to Mr. Sotala.  She had these mental techniques, little step-by-step algorithms to help you think through your plans, figure out what you really want and how best to get it, avoid pitfalls, stuff like that.  It was funny---she kept calling the pitfalls ‘failure modes.'  We had to translate for the little ones.”

*** Marco gave a price for Bitcoin that sounds like it's in the past, but it wasn't actually dated and there may have been a downturn. By locking in a specific day of the week to a specific date on the calendar, I sharply limited the set of years in which r!Animorphs could possibly be set; thus far we've only seen about six (continuous) months on camera.

Female guest speakers from America who are meeting with Jaan Tallinn and are competent to give a talk on goal factoring are likely [Julia Galef, Anna Salamon, Kenzi Amodei, Elizabeth Garrett, or __________ who appears sometime between now and then]. I guess it's distantly possible that they could be describing someone like Catherine Olsson or Cat Lavigne or Brienne Yudkowsky. Kaj Sotala is, afaik, uniquely identified (though he's not a high school teacher in a small suburb).

** Minor suggestion here (and I feel bad making a nitpick when I've never found the time to sit down and express my effusive praise for the story), but this part:

"And so I'd followed Dr. Koskinen into another room and laid my hands on a strange girl's arm, acquiring her. Then I'd dressed myself in clothes from the lost and found and followed him down to his car."

jars the attentive reader because it sounds like she gets dressed and gets in the car, where she's in morph, immediately following the acquisition - without waiting hours for the technology to make its first analysis. You do seem to have taken this into account when you give a five-hour timeframe later, but in the moment it seems like a continuity error.

*** Since I went back to check Elfangor's wording, I noticed something - he credits the speed of subsequent acquisitions to the shared ancestry of life on Earth, which implies alien species would not be so quick to process. It seems a fair-enough theory to assume having acquired anything provides some partial speed advantage, which makes it plausible Jake was able to morph his dog quickly enough for a shower to be a natural cover and not a 13 year old running the house at midnight. It does seem to still be an issue with the Marcos in the monster mash, where they swap to their first native morph with such speed and urgency the Marco already demorphed and available to cover them gets left behind to watch himself die. Hahah, sorry to treat the story like some kind of adversarial puzzle! I'm just kind of obsessed with it... I'll find the time someday to write some paragraphs about why

I really wanted to think that maybe V1 was coerced into giving up those codes she was talking about last chapter, but if that was the case why wouldn't the Animorphs take credit for it? That would be a major moral boost and Marco would know humanity would need it.

Also is Rachel all the way stroked out or can she recover? Don't do Rachel like that man, that's fucked up.

When this fic decides to be snarky at canon, boy it does not hold back. I really think that's what's missed the most if you haven't read the source material -- all those moments where r!Animorphs is just completely vicious about something that was, tbh, kind stupid in the original. Visser 3's Disney-andalite reveal was another moment like that, that stood out for how pointed it was. I really like those moments, but they're also slightly jarring.

Other things I appreciate in this fic: the text is fully inside the perspective of the protagonist. I really think this is something that divides the okay fiction from the great fiction, and I think this fic does it excellently. The positioning of the flashbacks to match demorphing and the end sequence where you're inside the perspective of her stroke really drive it home, this chapter. It might sound like a simple, entry-level thing, but I think it's harder than it looks, and a lot of fiction, even serious published paper fiction, will slip into author perspective at times. It also centres character thought processes, which is something I enjoy in rationalfic.

#+begin_quote
  The Yeerk pool, Tidwell and Illim--- ....

  That was all I could remember.
#+end_quote

One of the most unique things about this fic is how the characters periodically get reset to previous versions, completely undoing the character development that happened since. I'm not sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, this means there are real, permanent consequences when things go wrong. On the other hand, it's frustrating as a reader having things constantly undone. In this chapter there's a nice balance because Rachel is getting memories from her other self, and is able to see the path that she would have walked down and deliberately steer herself in a different direction. I've never seen that kind of dynamic explored in fiction before in quite this way, and it's really cool, but still frustrating.

The way Rachel is getting these memories doesn't quite make sense to me. I get that when she demorphs, there's something about the residual yeerk tissue still in her brain that is transferring information as it slowly dies. But why is she getting her own memories? I assume that you get the memories of the person who morphed into you and stayed past the time limit. But this version of Rachel came from a cancer patient morphing her, right? Why wouldn't she get the cancer patient's memories? I guess there's just some information leak from other versions of herself in the morphing tech's storage system, somehow. (So then couldn't she get the memories of any morpher from any time and place?)

#+begin_quote
  There's exactly one review of this story on Goodreads that's longer than a sentence! It comes from user Mark and features many memorable sentences like "the author uses this as a vehicle to mine others' notstalgia for their own self-indulgence and misses what made the originals so appealing" and "themes of loss, dehumanization, and the morality of war aren't really carried over" and "the other changes are just fine, I guess, but don't really serve any purpose in my opinion...at best, they make the main characters somewhat one-dimensional"
#+end_quote

Well, I strongly disagree with this reviewer, of course. I suppose people who aren't familiar with rationalist tropes tend to have these sorts of problems with rational fics, but I think the worldbuilding here is genius and awesome. I do think that this fic /feels/ very different from the originals. When I started reading this, I went back and reread some of the original Animorphs books, and I could barely get through them because the characters were so immature and anti-rationalist by comparison. The major themes of loss, dehumanization, and the morality of war /do/ carry over, I think, but in an incredibly weird and unique way that only a rationalist fanfiction of the already weird Animorphs could possibly have done. Everything about mind sharing / voluntary controllers / character resets / character cloning makes complete sense in-universe and is also completely unique in fiction (to this extent), as far as I'm aware.

I mean, he's not wrong - they could recruit so many more people than what they've done.

Okay, wow, what on /earth/ is this vision, because it's definitely not something that happened [yet]. A flash forward? A memory from an alternate timeline?

*** Rachel getting visions like that is weird, and we don't know why that's happening but it's safe to assume that it's related to Rachel's general weirdness. She wasn't part of the Ellimist's prophecy, she isn't seen as a namable person by the Chee, etc.

Memory injection happening during demorph has happened before, every timestop/Ellimist interaction has been through that. The morphing tech moves the mind from meat to some sort of Z-space emulator (and puts the body in stasis) and unmorphing involves moving that mindstate back into the meat brain.

** With all the other subtle nods to canon (Marco cutting off Helium as he tries to explain Hork-Bajir linguistics a couple chapters ago <3), there's one I've been looking out for: Rachel makes a critical choice that could sway the E/C game. Throughout the later books in canon, Rachel has a standing offer from Crayak: Immortality, awesome power, and eternity as Crayak's right-hand girl, and all she has to do is kill Jake. Given that the game is supposed to be about setting up situations where important events hinge on the kids' choices, and that if she hadn't talked Ante back from the brink the cube would likely be lost (no one to translate Finnish for Garret-morph at the bank), I wonder if the whole "which kind of person do I want to be?" sequence was meant to be a parallel to that?

** Well, now that I've finally finished it, for what it's worth /I/ think this chapter definitely had a reason to be as long as it did, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

One of the reasons I find getting back into this story a little confusing at the start of each chapter is that it's not just a long time between events and characters PoVs, but also because of times like this, when the character isn't actually in the right "timeline" as the rest of the story. This was handled well, however, and I love how the glimpses into alternate-future-Rachel and the effect that had on current-Rachel allowed you to bring up the concept of the Sculptor, and I think you executed on that wonderfully.

Also I'm glad you found a way to not show the animal actually die, and this made me look up what the material might actually have been, and I'm not sure if this is the one you pictured the teacher using but apparently a material that can withstand thermite has the badass name of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlite][starlite]], which allows for something called a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtm_xOtw_r0][starlite crucible]] to actually be a real thing.
