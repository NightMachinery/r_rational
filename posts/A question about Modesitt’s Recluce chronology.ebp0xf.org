I know the Saga of Recluce's chronology has been available online for at least --- as far as I am aware --- several years, in Modesitt's website, in the publisher's and fans' websites, as well as in Wikipedia. However, when did it become common knowledge? I have the e-books, and the first time I entered into contact with the series was about 15 years ago, via a regular book, to which I currently don't have access. Was the year of each novel indicated in each book, along with the map, perhaps? Or, did the author at one point decide to reveal the chronology after several of the novels were released?


** I don't know if Modesitt ever handed down a Word of God chronological ordering, but from what I recall it's not too hard to piece together - the author tends to drop information about when the books take place within the novels.

*** Apart from the information fragments in the novels (which I love, by the way). I wonder how the complete and exact chronology that is currently available originated. Was it all calculated by the readers? Has it been confirmed by Modesitt?

** I think omitting the timeline was intentional (at least to start), as Modesitt has repeatedly expressed the opinion that his books should be read in publishing order, not chronological order.

** If anyone is diving through this subreddit- this question was answered [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ebwl77/a_question_about_modesitts_recluce_chronology/fbao28p/][here]] better than I was about to. Tl;dr: Modesitt sent a chronology to a fansite that he sort of endorsed a couple decades ago that whatever chronology you can find today is based on; there's nothing in the books that would nail down exact years for most of it, though the general order and spacing can be figured out through close reading.
