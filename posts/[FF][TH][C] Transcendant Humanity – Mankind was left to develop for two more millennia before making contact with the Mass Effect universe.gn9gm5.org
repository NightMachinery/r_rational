** I'm posting this since it appears that after some few years of laying fallow that the story has been picked up by its author and completed. They published eight chapters in February and March and ended on a note that feels "this is done"-y.

As the OP description tells you, /Transcendant Humanity/ is a transhumanist story taking place in the /Mass Effect/ setting, but effectively adjusting the timeline to the year 4xxx, adding about two thousand years of technological development for mankind. Something like the Prothean Beacon was found, but it was basically just a warning:

"We came. We Watched. We studied you in your infancy, and hoped to see you grow into kin.

"But THEY came. THEY destroyed us. THEY wiped our race from the stars, until only those of us here remained.

"THEY can trace our technology, so we are leaving. THEY will not find you. You will be safe.

"Trust not the Gates, nor the Keep.

"Grow Strong, Little Ones. Save yourselves, and avenge us."

Thus humankind develops technology like mind uploading and materials far in advance of anything the Council races can field, and it grows, while remaining limited to Sol, until the inevitable first contact comes after unearthing the Charon Relay.

One can easily classify this story as a [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]], due to the large technological disparity between the Transcendant Humanity and the Citadel Council, but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that humankind didn't have access to any eezo until they found the Charon relay, and even then they developed their own, eezo-independent technology rather than blindly jump into mass effect technology. While one of humanity's advantages is its technology, the Council is partly interested---and fearful---for Sol's industrial capability, housing about 100 billion corporeal humans, and close to a trillion uploaded humans. That humankind is in the process of building a Dyson shell, which was the reason Charon and Pluto were being dismantled in the first place, doesn't help either.

I suspect this story is probably known to many subscribers of this subreddit (and I might have found it here, even), due to its transhumanist streak, and while one may argue that characters might not be up there on the competence scale, I feel that they mostly remained believable and thoughtful in their decision making.

Given that some seven years after it started it is now complete (at least I assume so), I figured you'd like to know about this.

** So I've been following this one before the long Hiatus.

It's a good story, but it's always been more of a [[/r/HFY]] story than a pure [[/r/rational]] one.

Overall I would give it a recommendation as a good read, it's got some well executed rarely used scifi tropes, and it plays with a lot more of them. It's a good story for a basic execution of the ideas.

It is not the best story when it comes to characterization, the point of view jumping around and eventually floating out to a view of treating nearly all of Humanity as a nebulous character towards the end.

I do have to commend the author for coming back and at least writing a finish after the long Hiatus, that's difficult to do even if the style does change as a result.

I would argue though that the ending is rational, even if it seems somewhat fantastical. The Matrioska brain, methods of conciousness divergence, networking, and ship methods are familiar to people who follow [[/r/IsaacArthur]] and the long-term transhumanism explored in his video expose's. This story is nice for looking at those ideas from a fictional perspective, but again it's a light touch on the ideas. Some stories like House of Suns and anything Banks has written hit specific ideas more directly.

This isn't a perfect story, but I'd still give it a recommendation.

Thanks for the recommendation. The titles on his Youtube videos sound promising! Here's hoping the content is good.

**** Kinda why I slipped it in, it's a great channel where the videos just casually discuss the disassembly of a solar system, and how to almost live forever. For a few trillions years at least.

I recommend the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef-mxjYkllw&list=PLIIOUpOge0LvT-g_LNsfX_2ld0pn-CDSZ&index=36][Megastructures]] series! Great one to start off on.

** Spoilers!

It got far too abstract with transcendent-techno-upload-hive-mind in the later chapters IMO. I couldn't read it past some point because I completely couldn't sympathize with the characters and everything was full of pseudo-techno gibberish.

*** Don't be silly. You don't read rational fanfic to sympathise with the characters, you read it to stroke your beard while the main character says a lot of things about science and society that you already agreed with

But being serious, the basic premise sounds good enough that I'll at least try this, and I'll see if I just tag out later on

EDIT: Yeah, this is just HFY wank.

** Cons: definitely HFY and not rational. Issues with scale. The tech disparity doesn't really make sense even given 2000 years, after all most species follow Prothean and eezo tech because it's generally the superior option. Pros: Not as bad as it could have been. I rather liked the invasion of the Bartarians as there was actual thought put into the defense by a competent commander. He took the tech asymmetry seriously and leveraged what advantages they had, such as using FTL for hit and run tactics and using the alpha relay to send reinforcements to an unexpected location and considering how politics affects the goals and tactics used. The depiction of cyberspace isn't quite as cringe inducing as is typical.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't really worth reading.

*** I'd argue that the tech disparity is justified because of the numerical advantage. The other races had discovered AI and uploads, and were at that point likely far ahead of humanity. However, their banned AI and decided against uploading, which limited their population growth. On the other hand, humanity was warned about the reapers, which pushed them ahead - which probably contributed to their willingness to embrace the upload.
