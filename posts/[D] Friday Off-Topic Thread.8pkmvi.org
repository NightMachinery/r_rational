Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

** Crossposting from myself:

Every time there's been a series of warfare chapters in A Practical Guide to Evil, I get in the mood to play some RTS or strategy games. A few days ago I found one that /really/ fits the feelings evoked by the Practical Guide's writing.

For those that don't know, Total War games are all about top level turn-based strategy, combined with up close, real-time warfare tactics. I've never really been able to get into the series, but awhile back I happened to get the Warhammer one in some bundle or the other. After these recent chapters, I decided to try it, and Gods Below does it fit!

Setting archers up on high ground to rain arrows down on the enemy? Check. Using siege weapons against infantry to make up for differences in army size? Check. Spreading your formations out so that none of the enemy can break through and pincer your men? Check. Giant monsters that will clobber their way through your lines if you don't have something to stop them? Check.

Let me tell you, the first time you send your cavalry unit around some forest to avoid their defensive pikemen so you can stampede all over the enemy archers without being seen, then use them to plow into the back of enemy infantry as they're locked in combat with your front lines, you'll feel like Grem One Eye himself. If he had mounted knights to play with, anyway.

What made me post this, though, was a recent battle I was just in. The game also has Heroes in it, kind of like the Warcraft 3 RTS, both Lords (who command armies and act as the overworld units that go from place to place) and Heroes of all kinds, who can also act in the overworld or take up an army unit slot and use special abilities. My lands got invaded by some vampire Lord who was sacking one of my cities, and I scoffed when I saw his army size. My nearest Lord had 18 units in his army (each of which contained anywhere between 40-120 individual soldiers that move and fight in formation), made up of swordsmen, pikemen, archers, cavalry, the works, plus 1 Hero, a Witch Hunter. The enemy had maybe 8 units... and though they also had 4 Heroes with their Lord, I figured I'd just have to wear them down once I scattered their army.

It was a massacre.

My cavalry were stopped cold by one of the enemy Heroes, who just shrugged off their charges and kept knocking them down one by one. Some banshee Hero kept flying around and disrupting my archers, and I had no one to send at her to stop the harassment because my Witch Hunter was stuck in combat with another. My army formations kept getting holes blown in them for enemies to spill through thanks to huge AoE spells from some caster Hero, and when I reluctantly dragged my Lord away to try and deal with him, their Lord used some ability to rapidly deteriorate my troops' morale, causing them to start routing. (Normally troops will break and run if they're taking too much of a beating too fast, regardless of how much health they have. Having a Lord or Hero around helps avoid that but normally it takes a little while)

I walked onto the battlefield with ~1800 troops not counting my Lord and Hero, while they entered with about ~700. I was forced to retreat with a scant 1/3 of my army, while they lost only half their forces. I managed to kill one of their Heroes, but they killed my Lord and wounded (temporarily incapacitated) my Hero.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still new to the game so probably screwed up royally a few times. But since then, I've had immensely more sympathy for Cat and Juniper's current difficulties. The alignments may be reversed, and she rarely has the numerical advantage, but fuck, being outnumbered in Heroes is a /nightmare/ to deal with when all you can throw at them are mere mortals who'll get cut down or tossed around like toy soldiers.

Sadly, though there are like a dozen different factions and races with their own unique units, you can't make an army out of orcs, goblins, humans, etc all at the same time. Still, 9/10, would recommend.

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

Well.  Well well well.  It's been a while since I've posted anything.  I stayed in my cave doing nothing much of note for several months, in spite of feeble attempts to get something worthy of an update post up on here, which fizzled pretty hard.  However, the moment that it started getting 70 degrees outside, I suddenly found my motivation back with a vengeance, which makes me wonder if I'm affected by seasonal affective disorder or something adjacent to it.

I have to say, it's /nice/ coming home and working on stuff for hours on end again.

I'm probably not going to pretend to attempt to keep a weekly update schedule, and just stick to posting interesting things as they come up.  Most of the design has at one point or another come up in these updates, and besides minor course adjustments as new people come into the Discord channel and spark new variants on old arguments, it would get a bit repetitive to keep bringing them up here.

--------------

In the first couple of weeks after my sanity returned I pulled out a machete and dove into the XGEF code, which had been left last in a state of minor disrepair.  

(As a reminder, XGEF is the modding framework that I've built for the Renegade game itself to be built around.  The name is short for eXtensible Game Engine Framework, and is basically just a modding library. One of the core tenants of this game's design is the ability for me to walk away from the project at any time (in spite of the fact that I have managed to keep from abandoning it for nearly two years now) and have it still be in a state that can be maintained, even by those unable to take over the codebase.)

But so after fixing some long-standing bugs, biting the bullet and rearranging some core organization that I shied away from last time I worked on it, and finishing up the remains of the last TODO list I had made for it, I got XGEF running again.

(DON'T EVER leave a codebase in a state that doesn't compile.  You never know when you're going to take a 9 month break and have to decipher stuff that you were /sure/ was only going to take a night's hacking to fix.)

With XGEF fixed up, I began to take a look at the server/client setup that it will utilize.  While I don't particularly care to figure out how to make Renegade a viable multiplayer option, I don't want to unnecessarily hinder anyone who feels the desire to mod it in.  A more relevant requirement, however, is that I want to support multiple clients, as in, different programs that Renegade could be ran in. This requires completely separating the game's logic from its presentation, which is good practice /anyway/, and just gives me an excuse to enforce it.

I [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/444606832837787649/unknown.png][drew up some pretty diagrams]] trying to work out how exactly I wanted the division to work and spent some time reading [[https://gafferongames.com/categories/building-a-game-network-protocol][the /excellent/ “building a game network protocol”]] and other blog posts series over on gafferongames (I can highly recommend both of the major sequences on that site; they've been invaluable for wrapping my head around the mechanics of real-time game networking).  

This eventually lead me to a model where the client attempts to connect to a server at a known address and, if successful, immediately requests the current networking mod to be downloaded and reconnected with.  If no server responds, then the client spins one up and tries again. All inputs from the player are mapped to actions which the server can respond to/correct/veto as needed.

Eventually I got a simple demo together that has the client moving a character around a command-line hex grid.  The server only cares from a logical perspective about which hex a given unit is occupying, but always moving diagonally or zig-zagging or whatnot in a real-time movement would be a colossal pain for the player.  Thus, the client can permit slightly freer movement using the familiar WASD, only updating the server when the player crosses hex boundaries:

[[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/230041937984487424/453401451465539606/command_line_grid.gif]]

In the above gif, the user controls the X via WASD in the client.  The server's record of the player's position is marked with the dot, showing that logically it doesn't care about any sub-hex quality of life movement.  It also controls the wrapping--when the player attempts to move to a hex that doesn't exist, the server corrects the movement and pushes the player to the opposite end of the map.

My current task is to take the existing prototype and rewrite it to use actual networking now--the gif above shows the setup with fake networking.  This will be a function of XGEF itself, so it's back into the framework to find a good way to divide the organization up.

--------------

I'll try and make these updates more frequent, which is to say, I'll try and have things to actually show off.

It sounds like your issue is not the speed of your words but talking before you have fully-formed ideas? I do that sometimes too but never really have a problem with it. I think you might want to work on techniques to address nervousness/anxiety rather than talking speed.

** I went on a two day training course that was an introduction into a traffic modelling program that I regularly review output from in my job.

It was really interesting and the technical aspects reminded me why I love my field, even if right now my boss is... suboptimal.

So now of course I'm considering signing up for this master's degree: [[https://www.monash.edu/engineering/master-transport/course-details]]

But... I'm already studying nutrition part time (and super enjoying it). A relevant master's degree is something my work would probably give me paid time off for (AWESOME). It would take me 2 years, max, to finish and I'd possibly get it done in one year if I got two days a week off for study. And if I decide I don't like it I can actually exit early with a lesser qualification, so it's not necessarily even any "wasted time".

I see myself at a crossroads: either ultimately becoming a researcher or programmer (I /do/ have a computer science degree hanging up somewhere gathering dust, but I hated cutting code, was more interested in management/documentation/QA/etc...) in the transport space, or continuing as a (generalist?) project manager, or doing a complete 180 and becoming a nutritionist / dietitian / similar sort of public health officer (which probably would require a pay cut).

I have so many options, and it's exciting to think about, but it's also terrifying because I could make the "wrong" decision. I've been studying nutrition for nearly 3 years now and I've gotten so much out of it, but there's still another, like, 4 years before I get my bachelor degree unless I study more units at once (which I could do, my HD average means I can afford to put less effort in), take more time off work (I take one day a week off already, and it obviously involves a pay cut), or like quit my job or something. Really with nutrition I'm quite happy to keep studying at a snail's pace since it'll take so long anyway.

I guess I'll finish my nutrition study for this year, and if I still am excited about getting a master's in transport engineering, then I'll change over. See how I like it after six months.

** Today in CouteauBleu's wacky love life: Online dating baffles me on a deep level.

I see a lot of people reporting their experience of getting ghosted, harassed, ignored, disrespected, etc, and a primal part of my brain thinks "Great, I don't ghost, harass, ignore, or disrespect people, I'll probably have a ton of success" (which is totally something stories condition you to believe with the "emotionally wary girl who thinks all men are jerks learns to open up thanks to the caring respectful male protagonist" archetype), which is not how it works in real life.

But... why? Like, people do online dating to find dates, and I know for a fact that lots of women mostly get a majority of obviously copy-pasted messages and complain about it, so what statistical sorcery makes me get no attention?

Running theories, with some overlap:

- I'm a fine introverted, socially isolated young man with niche hobbies who spends most of his time on the internet, which is as high-supply-low-demand as you can get on dating apps. No amount of clever message writing can get me past the "uuuugh" factor most women feel when looking at my profile / photos.

- Women on dating websites don't get more non-crappy messages than I think, it's just that the ones who only get crap are more likely to report it.

- There's like 10x more men than women in online dating and I'm not especially attractive, which means I'm in a "waiting line" kind of spot where women have an abundance of more attractive men they want to try their luck with first. The dating algorithms may even have noticed this and given me a low priority on women's swipe lists.

- The major difficulty in online dating isn't weeding out harassers and ostensibly bad people, it's that two randomly selected people (especially on a dating app) are unlikely to be mutually interested in each other, even if they're otherwise good people.

Mh.

Bonus theories, unknown plausibility:

- There is an ocean of invisible jerks permeating everything both among men and women. Dating is therefore a coordination problem where the non-jerks try to reach each other but end up only ever reaching jerks and getting a skewed perspective. (it goes without saying that any lady who's uninterested in my romantic attention qualifies as a jerk; also, every guy who isn't me)

- I have a bad model of people because I'm way more self-aware than average. People like to /signal/ how virtuous they are and rail against eg ghosting and copy-pasted messages, but when you look at their actual incentivized habits on dating apps where they have relative anonymity and no consequences, people are perfectly with ghosting other people, and don't make a sincere effort (besides complaining) to get or reply to pertinent messages.

(I don't actually believe in these two theories, but I'm curious how you'd argue against them)

*** Collectively, women rate 80% of men as having 'below average' appearance. So if you are competing on looks (eg swipe apps) you must be in the top 20%. Otherwise, you have to find some other ground to compete on (wealth, fetish, 'makes me laugh', subculture trait, etc).

*** Turn the table around and look at it from their perspective. Suppose online dating apps were instead flooded with women and 90% of them are very interested in sex, perhaps almost solely interested in it, and would absolutely sleep with you if you just gave them a date, time, and location. You now have the option to be picky, and you might as well be. Each new partner is of course a new STD risk, so you might as well try to get someone you'd be happy with in a long-term relationship.

Ideally, you're trying to get that dream situation, a long-term relationship with a smart, funny, emotionally stable, slim, and attractive woman who shares your interests, is working a decently-paying full time job, and will not have terribly high expectations of you, so you can occasionally cook, do some chores, and not necessarily have to go to work. This is generally not a thing for men. For women ... it's unlikely, but it happens, and often enough to keep the hope alive.

It's not necessarily that you're up against 10 or 100 other guys. It's more that you're competing with the /idea of a perfect or near-perfect guy/ in the mind of a person who has every reason to be picky. The picky mindset only goes away when the interest declines, which can come with increased age and weight gain/obesity, where the mindset gets closer to yours, that it will be difficult to find anyone to have a relationship with.

You basically have four options:

1. Wait a very long time, possibly indefinitely. You can continue using dating apps, and trying to meet up with people IRL, but just be aware that it may be a very long time before something works out.

2. Improve yourself, become more attractive, learn to be more sociable and funny, get whatever education you need to get a job you like that pays well, and see if you get better results.

3. Lower your standards, pursue women that most other men will not go for. This is quick and theoretically easy depending on your interests and tastes.

4. Pursue women in a different demographic. You could try building friendships with women in developing countries like China, South Korea, Thailand, etc. In those countries, more people walk rather than drive, take stairs more than elevators, and generally eat a diet with more vegetables, so weight tends to be lower if that's a big factor for you. You will also be relatively taller than you would be compared to men in most English-speaking countries, so overall attractiveness may be higher in both directions.

***** Honestly, I feel like dating apps by themselves are skeevy and crass. I interpreted your use of dating apps and your concern about your own appearance as "Looks matter. A lot." and went from there. The first, most prominent factor in every dating app is the picture of the other person. That's a tool you use when appearances are a high priority, if not the top priority. If you're looking for someone who is smart, rational, level-headed, mature, etc. and you don't necessarily care about appearances, then dating apps may not be the way to go. You might have better luck ditching the dating apps and trying to meet someone like that at a university.

*** I agree that an example of a first message would be very helpful, and are you still using OKC? Maybe try tinder and use the right-swipe proportion that articles recommend (too many and they think you're not paying attention, too few and they don't want to risk showing people your picture if you probably won't be swiping right to your right-swipers). Tinder also has the benefit of automatically working out which of your pictures are the best by the proportion of right swipes (my husband's tinder ended up with a photo that had our dog in it but not him as his best photo: thanks for showing I have good taste, swipe app!)

OKC's changed recently so that women are only showed messages from men they've "liked". I only log on to OKC very rarely nowadays so I'm not sure what women who actively use it are doing with regards to messages.

EDIT: OK, I went on OKC to see what it was like, and just logging in and responding to a couple of match questions, I got a message in my inbox. Great, and now trying to find who messaged me on the "match finder" thing I instead found someone who seems really interesting and I guess I'm going to message him and if I end up getting married to him because of this then you will have somehow managed to in a fit of irony got someone /else/ romantically connected.

I guess in the interests of potentially maybe helping you, this is what his profile looked like:

[[https://i.imgur.com/Carge2c.png]]

The self-summary is what got me interested.

EDIT 2: I found the guy who sent me a message. Empty profile and the message is: "Hey have you ever wrestled someone?". I am swooning over here.

EDIT 3: And another guy had apparently sent me a "hi there".

*** Simpler solution that I can't know is true: you have a subpar profile page. There's only so much of yourself that you can show in a short conversation, and much less that you can show without seeming incredibly desperate, but a profile page is the method of showing people who you are. It's not just a way of expressing yourself, it's telling people what aspects of yourself that you're willing to publicize. As a woman, it would make more sense to weed out potential dates based on what men choose to show in their profile, because you don't have to spend multiple minutes on every guy asking what his hobbies are, career, general personality, etc. It just isn't worth the investment to ask all those questions to the people who haven't put the effort into making a decent profile in the first place.

Also, photography matters. A good camera is correlated with matches last time I checked, but even besides the camera your ability to make yourself look good in your profile picture is important. Good lighting, camera angle, framing, etc. I think women learn these things more often than men, and the lack of them is more noticeable.

Similarly, dressing well is a good way of selling yourself. While I don't think that most women have special insight into men's fashion that could be expected from interest in their own fashion, the lack of fashion is usually fairly obvious. Well fitting clothes, decent color matching, outfits that seem cohesive, just general thought put into your outfit is a good way to make a better impression.

Working out and being/looking healthy I think is sufficiently obvious as to not warrant further discussion.

Generally, I would try to look at the simple stuff, and try to fix that, before making any wider conclusions about either yourself or other people. If my mouse isn't working, I check that it's plugged in before filing a bug report for the mouse drivers.

*** additional, the profiles you are writing are inactive or fake (depending on the site you are using).

I got somewhat 1:20 responses when I tried online dating. (And I did use a cartoon picture as profil pic.) And I only wrote active profiles. Still they needed always a few days to answer.

I also opened a fake profil with some random female picture (not a model). And got like 15 responses without filling out the profile in a month. I asked all what they get for replies and most couldn't/wouldn't answer that question. Some only wrote "Hello" and didn't respond to anything else.

Also I heard someone made a profile with the same info he had on his but with a male model as pic and got the famous "hello" from females. So looks count.

So what you can do:

- Change your posture (in RL and on your profile pic). I assume you have a bad one because you are saying you are introvert. Try to have an open body language.

- If you have pets, on the pic with them.

- Change to a site for some subculture you belong to. Maybe try niche hobbies with more females in it.

- If you get a response, ask for a meet up fairly quick . Like a coffee shop you go to or some niche hobby location.

Anyhow I found a gf in my friends group and had only bad dates with online dating (three). So not sure how much you should listen to me.

  [W]hat statistical sorcery makes me get no attention?
#+end_quote

Do you want math? Probably not, but here we go, starting with the following assumptions:

- A lot of people get “ghosted, harassed, ignored, [or] disrespected”
- “[W]omen mostly get a majority of obviously copy-pasted messages and complain about it”
- “There's like 10x more men than women in online dating”

First, I note that the second point is much stronger than the first: A lot of people may still be a small fraction, especially online, where there is a selection towards those more likely to speak up. Depending on the origin of your data, your analysis could end right here. But that is not very interesting.

We are interested in the fraction of ‘jerks' of your competition. If, say, 90% of the messages sent are ‘jerky', then we can assume 90% of your competitors to be jerks, right? Well, that depends on the amount of messages sent. I do not think it would be a stretch to assume that copy-pasting messages leads to a larger volume of them. The break-even point here would be at 9x, so if they sent 9 times as many messages, you could conclude them to be 50% of the competition. Obviously, the exact numbers are guesswork.

Still, I think that the combination of selection (disrespectful messages can generate a lot of complains even if making up a small fraction of messages, also it does not take a lot of them to ruin one's day) and asymmetric amount of messages sent should lead you to the conclusion that the fraction of jerks is not that large. Personally, I would believe them to be a minority, but for the sake of argument, assume it to be 50%.

Hence, any non-jerk is in the top 50%. Now the third point becomes relevant. There is a disparity of the number of competitors and potential matches. Your 10x wasn't meant literally, of course, but I don't think the number is too unrealistic. You would then have to be in the top 10% of the competition to beat out the supply-demand imbalance. But non-jerkyness only gets you to the top 50%.

All of the above is very much simplifying, based on flawed assumptions, and the numbers are pulled from thin air. However, I think they are more on the conservative side, and can certainly inform one's intuition. /My/ intuition certainly tells me that not being a jerk is at most a slight advantage.

Final note: I would strongly recommend against analysing social interactions using numbers, intuition is much better at that. Trying to understand one's intuition is fine, though.

*** Not disrespecting or harassing people on dating sites is often a necessary but not sufficient condition for success --- though those you're interested in might receive majority such messages, just being in the preferable minority does not guarantee response. A few years ago a friend I was crashing with was trying the online dating thing out and complained about her failure there. Having had good experiences in that sphere myself (my then girlfriend, now wife was met on OkC) I offered to look through her profile and offer suggestions. Turns out, her profile was pretty lame (pretty much just a copy+paste of her CV lol) but in the hour or two we spent chatting about it she probably received hundreds of messages (and also complained about having to delete-all to make space in her inbox constantly). Most of the messages were 1-word or copypasta, but probably a few dozen were the generic 1-2 paragraph thing cleverly commenting on an aspect of her profile and sharing something relevant about themselves, closing with an open ended question. But there were still just so many of those that even reading them would be too laborious, much less responding to them all! So the first level of filter was usually just having an interesting thumbnail (and then that would warrant a read of their opening message, but the effect of its quality on response probability was balanced pretty evenly with remainder pictures and decent profile). So have you considered those are simply not to the liking of your target audience?

** I re-read HPMOR a few weeks ago and had a theory. How prevalent among the community is the theory that everything that happened at the end was part of voldemort plan? That he actually wanted to be killed/defeated, or that possibly he didn't actually get killed and it was all a fakeout of some kind? I did read the discussion threads at the time (three years ago!) and I don't recall whether this was discussed as a possibility or not.

I think the crux of the issue is that it is too far-fetched for such a smart character as Quirrellmort is purported to be to leave Harry possession of his wand after the unbreakable vow, or for him to do so and also stop checking for betrayal in parseltongue. It doesn't make sense if he wasn't holding the idiot ball, which Yudkowsky promised he wouldn't do. Also, not really his style, IMO.

So what does that leave, if not an obscure interpretation?

One thing I thought pointed to this theory was that when Quirrellmort went "full voldemort" and started making those horrible sadistic threats in parseltongue, he mostly used conditionals, not statements. Even if what he said was strictly true, he could still say these things if he was strongly committed to precommitment(heh). "If you don't do x, I'll do y to the world". And he did say earlier during the Stanford prison experiment arc that he intended for Harry to rule magical Britain in parseltongue.

The only explanation that I can think of that doesn't make him into a dunce with his over the top voldemort act and breaking all his villain rules is that he was trying to "decondition" Harry of his affection toward Quirrelmort, so that harry would go through with killing him. IIRC, the part where he mentioned that he had lost count after hundreds of horcruxes was not in parseltongue. In fact, he switched on and off parseltongue a lot, for no apparent reason. He had all the power, and he expected to kill Harry soon. Why so much careful misdirection when he was in the midst of monologuing(another villain rule broken, btw)?

+Another thing that points to this theory being true is that the three wishes with 1 plot promise was almost certainly carried out. Now this one is just conjecture, because I think Eliezer didn't want to spell it out too obviously and so just let it happen off-screen, but he did make give a few clues that make very strong circumstantial evidence. Quirrell disappeared the snitch in order to distract people and abduct harry. So all the students were at this overlong quidditch match when they learn of voldemort's rebirth/redeath and Quirrell's death. They might even associate Quirrell's martyrdom with the interrupted quidditch game--probably never resumed--which had in the balance the house cup between ravenclaw and slytherin.+

+I think we're supposed to conclude that due to the students putting Quirrell on a massive pedestal, the school honoured him by realizing his plot to make Ravenclaw and Slytherin win the cup simultaneously, and that the students would also consider changing Quidditch on their own. All in a single (unrelated) plot.+

PS. This post was partly prompted by listening to the podcast Yudkowsky did with Sam Harris about AIs, which was pretty good. Go listen to it.

*** This theory is being re-discovered with various variations fairly frequently. Its main problem, in my opinion, is the way it overrides Riddle's canon motivation.

Riddle wanted Harry as an eternal opponent initially, true, but he abruptly changed his goals when he heard the doomsday prophecy. After that point he no longer cared about installing him as a nemesis, or his totally-not-friendship with him, in comparison to the existential threat he posed.

This theory's Voldemort has a reason for leaving Harry his wand, but /doesn't/ have a reason for /not/ doing his best to kill Harry the apocalypse boy. Which is a bigger problem. You may say that he realized that killing Harry was impossible, that the prophecy created a stable time loop --- but no, there are canon precedents for foiling prophecies completely (e. g., Dumbledore vs. omnicide), which is what Riddle was aiming for. It was supposed to be hard, yes, but Voldemort acknowledged the possibility of a failure, and responded to it by installing more countermeasures (e. g., Hermione the immortal morality chain), not by giving up.

In summary, this theory tries to explain Voldemort's mistake by postulating a discontinuity in his motivations, which doesn't seem satisfying.

... Or, well, that's how I see it.

*** Just writing not living up to standards.

The scene on the cemetery was planned from the beginning. So some mistakes came from that.

It would have made more sense if Harry had a second wand hidden (transfigured?) somewhere and Quirrell didn't think about it, because wizards have only one wand. Would make more sense than the rock in the ring.

Still would be a big Batman Gambit, what Harry would do. Maybe Quirrell thought Harry would kill him and he made a new Horcrux somewhere and didn't expect a mind wipe. Harry could also have learned the True Imperius Curse secretly (You get controlled without any saving rolls) and a decoy would have been discovered that way. If I remember correctly we didn't know Harry learned the Memory Charm in secret either (but it was hinted at I think).

But yeah it was stupid to let Harry keep the wand. I don't know if anyone mentioned Quirrell faking his defeat, but I didn't follow fan theories. Everyone was happy to be correct or why their prediction should be correct.

The problem is ad-blocking on mobile (android).

As far as I can tell, I can't just install the ad-block chrome extension on android chrome (although I'm not entirely sure why---I guess mobile chrome just doesn't support extensions).

I found that I can install an "adblock browser" app, which does block some ads, but it is slow and buggy and the experience is just worse than chrome with ads. (Incidentally, I did realize it /is/ convenient to have two browsers installed on my phone, so just so I can have multiple "tabs" open at once, but that's a separate issue.)

** I have a new kitten. That makes four cats in total now (I'm a 29 year old dude and I'm already basically an old cat lady, but whatever). I wasn't planning on getting another cat, I just found her and felt emotionally compelled to rescue her.

I'd like to know if anyone here can come up with an alternate explanation for how she came to be where she was when I found her, because she was only 5.5 or 6 weeks old and she shouldn't have been separated from her mother and littermates yet, and my running hypothesis is that someone may have thrown her out of the window of their car.

Six days ago (last Saturday), mom came home from work and then we left to go to PetSmart to get cat food and kitty litter. We had to get on the highway to get there.

It's hard to judge distance in a car, but if the on-ramp is like 1,500 feet long, Lyra was maybe 300 feet from the beginning of the on-ramp, and if it was (let's see... road lanes are about 12 feet wide on average, so...) 25 feet wide, she was on the right/passenger side of the road about 7 feet from the grass, so not in the middle of the road but still in severe danger of being run over.

I thought she was roadkill at first and I normally avoid looking at roadkill, but some unconscious intuition noticed that she wasn't flattened in any way whatsoever, and then we passed her, and I felt compelled to look back and it looked like she was rolling over. I screamed at my mom to stop and turn around, and she reversed a little bit of the way, but you're going about 80 feet per second at 60 mph, so we were already like 600 feet away and we could see cars starting to come, so I got out of the car and ran in the middle (not quite the middle, skewed left from my perspective and skewed right from the perspective of oncoming cars) of the road back to her, waving my arms up in the air to my right (oncoming cars' left) to direct people away from her, then saw her up close.

*Observations:* There was fresh blood on her nose and on her mouth and around the claws of her front two paws. She was dirty, and covered (well, not /covered,/, but, y'know) covered in flying/biting insects that looked kinda like smaller/angrier mosquitoes (I'm a bit concerned about how many times I got bit, but I'm fine now so I'll just assume it's fine). We continued to PetSmart (because they have a Banefield Vet office inside the building), but it was after 5pm so the vet was closed, so we took her to an emergency vet clinic whatever thing, and they looked her over and said that, other than the blood and a flea infestation and being slightly malnourished and probably having worms, she was fine, no broken bones or internal bleeding or anything (/obviously,/ since it was after 7pm at that point, they couldn't actually /do/ anything).

The blood was fresh, and she was clearly in shock, so whatever caused the blood had almost certainly happened extremely recently on the road itself.

While it's theoretically possible, I think it's extremely improbable for her nose and her mouth and her hands to have all been perfectly aligned to be /just barely/ grazed by the side of a tire without anything being crushed or broken. I'm pretty sure that any amount of contact with a tire at all whatsoever would have led to significantly more damage than what was observed. The pattern of the injuries is consistent with what you'd expect from landing face first with the arms extended.

I don't think it's likely that she was the new kitty of some little girl who due to age and inexperience rolled down the window for her new kitty to look outside and then kitty accidentally fell out, because 1) she was too young at 5.5/6 weeks for it to be likely for her to have been adopted and 2) this kitten was clearly born outside due to the fleas and biting insects and being skinny enough to see her ribs and worms.

(She /does/ have roundworms for now, but we took her to the vet the next day and got her $150 dollars worth of medicine and shots (god, we've already spent like $400 we don't really have on this cat), and she's got a followup appointment for another round of shots/meds; most kittens have worms anyway, and I've been feeding and touching (oxytocin is incredibly important for not growing up to be neurotic, and she's not getting the physical contact she should've had from being groomed by her mother and from sleeping 16 hours a day in a pile of 5 or 6 kittens) her religiously, so she's basically in "perfect" health now.)

Basically what I think is this: She was right around the age when she'd be starting to venture out of the nest with the mama cat. I think someone had a cat living on their property, and that cat had kittens, and then the kittens reached the right age and started coming out on the prowl with mom, and then whoever owned the property noticed the kittens for the first time and decided that wasn't acceptable and that the kittens had to go.

There's the issue of her being a singleton, and Whoever would've gotten rid of the entire litter, but there's a guardrail followed by a steep drop-off at the edge of the on-ramp, so it could just be that Lyra got lucky and was kinda dropped while the others were fully thrown. It's also possible that I unknowingly passed a few kittens on my way back to Lyra and just didn't see them because they'd been thrown farther into the grass and didn't hear them because they were in shock and not making noise, but if we all spent all day thinking about all the death in the world we'd go insane, so I'm going to assume that these theoretical kittens were thrown farther into the grass instead of landing on the road and so had more time to orient themselves to land correctly in the grass instead of landing nose-first on the pavement and that because of this they weren't in shock and ran into the woods out of fear of the cars.

Another issue is that I don't know why someone would go to the trouble of throwing kittens out of the window of a car - not even on the highway itself, but just barely at the beginning of the on-ramp where they could've easily been seen - at 6:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday (the blood was fresh and she was still in shock, and a lot of the people who live in this area are ignorant rednecks who might think it's funny to purposefully run over an animal, and a lot of people are stupid and don't pay attention while they're driving; I'm assuming she couldn't've been there for more than 3 or 4 minutes when we found her), instead of dropping the kittens of at a shelter/pound or a farm or something.

Can anyone think of a more likely explanation for how my little Lyra came to find herself in that situation?

*** Based on your description of how skinny she was, and the issue of roundworms, my best guess is that she was born as a stray and got separated from her mother. Unable to find her way back, she ended up severely malnourished and dehydrated along the side of the road. My best guess as to the blood on her claws and face is that a bird might have mistaken her for roadkill, like you almost did, and tried to start picking bits off of her, except she fought back causing the bird fly off to wait a bit longer.

**** Kittens of that age tend not too wander particularly far from their mother and the nest. A large enough bird would've carried her off or killed her, and a bird too small for either of those things would've backed off as soon as Lyra fought back.

I guess didn't really describe the damage well enough. Her left eye had a bit of a scab on the bottom eyelid, right where you'd apply eyeliner. The area between the eye and the mouth, where the whiskers are, looks a bit scabbed on the left side as well. Her bottom left lip is the only part of her mouth that's still a little swollen.

Her injuries don't look like a result of a bird pecking at her, they look like a result of friction, and there's a pattern to her injuries. The nose is the only central injury, the mouth and the whisker area and the eye injuries are all on the left side of the face.

*** Possibility - she was a stray, on the side of the road, and was injured by a stone thrown by a passing tyre?

**** I don't know. They /really/ don't wander any meaningful distance away from their nest/mother at that age, and I feel like it's unlikely for a mother to have made her nest near there. And she wasn't on the side of the road, she was full-on in the almost-middle of the road; it's just that that particular on-ramp, near its connection with the main road, is close to twice as wide as a single lane. I suppose it's possible that a stone could've been launched at her face, but I really think it's improbable that she was in the middle of the road because she walked there, I think she was there because someone put her there, and I think she would've gone into the grass almost immediately if she wasn't in shock.

** Quests usually work by people voting on choices. Is there room for a quest that branches in many directions?

Basically, the QM gives three optinos, A, B, and C. The audience votes as normal, and A wins, so the QM writes a chapter/post for A, which gives options A1, A2, and A3. But where we do things different is that /options B and C are still there/. The audience can vote for A1, A2, A3, B, or C. And if they voted for B, they would have A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, and C, and so on until there was a whole decision tree.

This would have a lot of obvious problems.

1. The QM would run a lot of risk of repeating themselves. In theory, some of this would be avoided by audience voting, because the audience wouldn't vote for a branch that looked redundant. In practice, I don't know if you could actually avoid things like introducing characters two or three different times when different branches first encounter them. You could do some copy+paste on that stuff, but it seems lazy and unsatsifying, because part of the fun would be seeing the different possibilities.
2. The audience would have foreknowledge. As an extreme example, something learned in branch A1B3A2A3C2 could be used in branch B to bypass some of the plot or metagame.
3. Quests are typically done on a forum, which doesn't really favor branching. Custom UI would solve the problem (and help solve the problem of ever-expanding choices, all of which need to be voted on).
4. You'd need a fast, competent author who's planned out a lot of things ahead of time, or is really good at working within constraints.
5. Voting is a problem all its own. Ranked choices? Approval voting? Something else?

I was thinking that one interesting thing might be to work the branching into the story itself; the first time your audience selects a prior branch, the protagonist remembers things from the other, later branch. In that way, it's not so much exploring other branches as it is a form of time travel, which then creates a meta-narrative. But if you have to lean on meta-narrative, maybe it isn't such a good idea after all.

*** [[https://www.writing.com/main/list_items.php/item_type/interactives][Interactive stories on writing.com]] are kind of like that, except that anyone can add a new branch. As you would expect, the result is a mess.

*** This might be low effort on my part, but this sounds a lot like a multiplayer visual novel. Apart from the voting/quest part of it I would say the rest has been done. If you weren't already aware of this consider looking into it. If you /were/, then yes I would say there is room for it? You would probably need a "better" author but voting doesn't seem radically different from normal quests so whatever works there I suppose.
