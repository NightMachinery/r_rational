Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** *Skysong Worldbuilding Part II: Resistance!*

Hi! I posted a couple weeks ago introducing the world and got some great input. Hoping for more productive discussion!

First thread can be found here:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dshiqf/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/f6pcz0m/?context=3]]

*Short Background Summary:*

A continent of floating islands orbits a massive crystal obelisk high above the clouds.

The islands are inhabited by the Kipii, tribes of sentient flying squirrels.

In the past few generations, they have been invaded by the Azkhal, a warlike civilization of Dragon Riders. The Azkhal drive the Kipii out, burning their forests and establishing strongholds. Over the years, the Azkhal grow rich and prosperous, finally putting down roots in the lush, resource rich islands. Their culture shifts from warlike to aristocratic and luxurious.

With the Azkhal came the Gragir, dwarven thralls that build their weapons and armor. The Gragir have lived as slaves for generations, but are starting to industrialize and wake up to their potential.

*New For this week: The Forsaken*

The floating crystals that give the islands life and hold them aloft thrum with audible power - and exude magical radiation.

Over the past few decades, Gragir craftsmen have learned to harness larger Crystal Shards for power, anchoring them in factory districts to run their machines.

While the dwarves working closely with the crystals protect themselves with lead and iron suits, radiation from the crystals seeps into the surrounding slums and water supply, causing sickness in the poor serfs who live there.

Among these people it is most common for the Forsaken to be born- twisted babes with tiny horns and tails. The superstitious and fervently religious Azkhal cast these children out, leaving them to the wilds, or worse, simply throwing them from the edges of the islands like so much trash.

But, over the years a few have survived. For a generation they lived as woods-witches and reclusive hermits at the fringes of society, outcasts from the rigid Caste structure of the Azkhal.

However, with time they learned their curse comes with power - they are closely attuned to the crystals, and can sense the network of Ley Lines that run through the lands connecting them. Tapping into the crystal's energy, they can wield the same force that holds up the land, creates fresh water from the air, and even produce intense heat and light.

Their greatest discovery, though, is that the Ley Lines form paths and connections through the world that they can move along at right angles to reality, teleporting long distances in an instant. However, this magic all has a cost - life force must be paid, either by the caster, or a sacrificial subject.

*Questions for this week:*

1. What are some resistance/guerrilla tactics the Kipii might employ to slow the Azkhal advance? Hitting supply lines and convoys at night, harassing outposts, assassinating scouts...How might the Azkhal adapt to these?
2. What tactics could the Forsaken employ, given limited telekinesis and teleportation, but very small numbers and few natural resources? Their top priority at first is saving other Forsaken children - what networks or underground societies might develop to foster this?
3. What might some of the terms or limitations of Forsaken magic be? The Crystals are fragments of the original creative force in the universe, and still echo with the will of that first act. They contain the shadow of consciousness, and respond to Attuned minds - but there is some conservation of energy at play. To manifest matter has an equal cost in mental energy or life force - ie you might have to kill a bug to cast a cantrip.

** So, what if you have an isekai world of the basic type, like, say, the world konosuba is making fun of. It occurred to me that the important people follow basically the Dudley Do-Right model of characters.

The Summoner is Nell.

The Hero is Dudley.

The Maoh is Snidely.

Let's take this as read. So, ok, it would follow then that the heroes defeat the villains, who kidnap the princess, who summon/order the heroes. We seem to be ok in terms of still being what the readers will recognize. Say each archetype has many members, lots of officials leading up to one summoner, lots of heroes up to one Chosen Hero, etc for the Maou.

What does the world look like, if the Rock Paper Scissor structure holds true? Say you defeat anyone of lower level, lose to anyone of higher level, and if the levels are equal the outcome is determined by the RPS system, with squiggle room for plot/willpower.

Well, the first thing I notice is that the roles have no reason to stay fixed if they are identical. So let's nail them down a bit by giving them special powers that encourage them to do what they are supposed to (officials lead citizens, heroes grind mobs, bandits perpetrate evil). Still feels squishy, so let's say in addition to having powers useful for that, let's say that doing the 'proper' thing for your type is how you gain levels.

Now everyone is inspired to do what we want them to do, and rewarded as well. So the world ought to look roughly 'right' for the classic Dragon Warrior dealy. You have people led by officials, mobs being hunted by slimes, and antags doing nefarious stuff.

What are some hooks to pick at this concept with? Anything interesting coming to mind, in terms of stories to tell in a world like this? My web serial is approaching its end and I'm starting to ponder the next topic...

*** This might be a bit meta, but what about if the powers for each group are different unrealistic parts of the cliche setting? For example:

- Officials are able to perform long rituals that create and maintain large-scale magical effects. Two of the most popular are safe zones - warded regions within which violent conflict is prohibited, typically encompassing the insides of the city walls, and resurrection points - floating glowing gems that can restore people to life. This encourages holding a fixed position and gives them a legitimate claim to rulership, and without their support the heroic lifestyle is impossible. Based on save points and the player's inability to attack NPCs around town.
- Heroes are able to grow stronger by defeating enemies, rather than by training. When they defeat enemies, they are also converted into useful raw materials or items. This allows them to quickly grow strong enough to defeat demons, provided they have the motivation to endure the constant painful battling this growth requires - otherwise they can generate enough income for a luxurious lifestyle with little effort and have no need to become stronger. Based on levelling up and monster drops.
- Demons have the power of temporarily breaking the rules of the setting, bypassing impassable obstacles and killing experienced adventurers with a single attack that prevents their resurrection. The most powerful can even briefly render bystanders incapable of action. Because this can't be used often, it is most lucrative to take infrequent, high-reward actions, like raiding warded villages, kidnapping princesses, and breaking in to steal magical artefacts. This of course makes them the natural enemy of Officials. Based on the unreasonable effectiveness of villains in cutscenes.

As for story ideas, the first one that comes to mind would be following the people who don't use their roles in the ways their powers encourage.

- The brave ritualist always wanted to be an adventurer, and learned the magic of officials with that in mind. She lives as a hero with her trusted bodyguard and has weaponised the standard hero-summoning ritual by shortening the cast time so she can summon her ally multiple times in the same fight, effectively teleporting them out of danger and into advantageous positions. Later on she arranges another summoning contract with a giant/her pet boulder, who she summons directly above her opponents.
- The evil sorceress was kidnapped to be a sacrifice to a demon lord but somehow managed to slay them. Now she rules over his city, each district covered by a different safe zone that she can lift whenever she wants the rest of the city to fall on that quarter to pillage and murder. Her trusted subordinates have access to her save point, enabling them to take on missions with no chance of survival, and she maintains their loyalty by summoning heroes into slaughterhouses in bulk for them to feast on.
- The entitled hero always felt he deserved more from the people who summoned him to this world, and trained furiously so that he could prove that to them. Before he became strong enough to defeat the Maou, he realised he was powerful enough to lord over his starting village and has taken over. Now the rituals are going unperformed and the wards around town are falling apart, turning it into a safe haven for scum and villainy, and attracting true heroes to bring an end to his reign.
- The warrior king grew so powerful after slaying the Maou that no-one could hope to challenge him. Each day he delves to the deepest level of the local dungeon and returns with enough loot that the economy of the entire region is structured around him. With this much influence, his ascension to the throne was inevitable. What happens when he ages and can no longer keep up the pace of his adventures, or when a demon finally gets lucky and manages to slay him?
- The demon heir always chafed at the injustice in the demon realm and wanted to rule it as wisely as the officials. They can't create sustained magical effects, and so make do by instead stalking the night as a vigilante, slaying the worst offenders with dramatic and poetic executions until the capital is as peaceful as the best human cities, for criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot.
- The edgy avenger is a demon who aspires to heroism. They can't stay with their party for long, for fear of them discovering their heritage, and so lurk in the shadows to save them from impossible situations using their natural magic, only to return to hiding until their magic recovers.

#+begin_quote
  let's say that doing the 'proper' thing for your type is how you gain levels.
#+end_quote

You could also have the roles possess levels so while you can switch careers, you have to start over.* (And going back is easy.) Thus people specialize because they'll do better that way, while allowing for rare shifts - the town of starving citizens might turn to banditry, or if a bandit becomes a regular citizen, they may still be viewed with suspicion because they can go back to their old ways, and still be about as good at it as they used to be. While this might enable weaker combinations (people who fight monsters during the summer/when the slimes attack, but are citizens the other half the year), the strongest heroes will be the ones who just do that.

* This is imperfect in that there is reasonable overlap, and with the right transitions, you might want to allow that. Heroes and bandits both fight, so a hero who becomes a bandit should at least be good at that. Heroes might lead, say in emergency situations (especially those involving monsters), so if a hero (particularly a leader) retires (from hero work) and becomes an official that should work okay. Also, since bandits perpetrate evil, if someone turns them into monsters maybe there should be bonus (a lot when compared to citizens, less so compared to heroes).

*** interesting basic concept.

first, why do only the good guys get summons? the bad guys get their own summons as well. now we can have a system where both sides need summons, and now its a conflict focused on the resources needed to aquire and maintain summons.

summons are from other worlds. its kind of a crapshoot of what you get, but the summon should always be on the summoners side (unless they mess up the ritual badly). summons from high-tech worlds mean that you get occasional tech boosts, so the entire world has schizo-tech and spies looking out for new tech from summons.

heck, why do we not see more stories where the summons change the world with their tech? the 'guardian of the flame' series does this with gunpowder. its an older series of novels, but quite good. you could have a mechanic enforce the status quo, but that will just punish the summoned hero for trying to be clever.

**** My guess as far as why you don't see more stories where the world is changed via tech is that stories tend to work in the other direction.

That is, evil gets an unfair advantage, and good has to work desperately to counter it. Going all Connecticut Yankee lacks drama, yeah?

I liked the first of the Guardians of the Flame books a lot, "Definitely and Ohmlin", hehe. Been a long time since I thought of that, thanks for the reminder!

** i asked this in a different sub's misc thread

--------------

this question might be better for [[/r/rational][r/rational]] or the SSC sub but they don't have catchall threads rn so i thought i'd ask here:

say there's a group of people who never get sick, and live to the maximum of their window of longevity. so if they come from the type of people who live to be late 80s, that's typically when they pass. if they come from the type of people who live to be 100 or older, that's when they pass. they just in the meantime have completely healthy lives, so they only ever need to receive medical attention when they've suffered severe trauma.

this group is distributed equally, functionally identical in proportion to population. it's a very small number of people, but as a trait a person passes it on to all of their children.

at what % of world population do you think it would pass from being unknown, to becoming rumor, to becoming accepted fact?

in this hypothetical the world wouldn't notice until the present so when the phenomenon starts doesn't matter

is it 1%? Less? 5%? More?

--------------

i received only one response, which was useful for my consideration but not a solution, i'm including it and my own response:

#+begin_quote
  Doesn't matter about world percentage of population, there would simply be different assumptions about disease prevalence, the higher the percentage, the less likely you'd notice by pattern matching

  What really matters is plague incidence near families who carry. It would be instantly recognized if there was a family or multiple families that didn't get sick in the middle of a plague zone

  When it starts matters because if the gene is passed 100% reliably to all children and is not a recent de novo mutation, it's quite likely that the totality of the population has it, especially since it's a major fitness adaptation
#+end_quote

*my response:*

#+begin_quote
  it's a detail of a story i'm writing

  after world war 2, a very small percentage of children who are born don't ever get seriously ill or perhaps sick at all, and as the trait passes on to all immediate and subsequent progeny, the population of these "healthful" only ever grows

  what's the maximum amount of time that it's plausible to say it takes before the phenomenon is studied? where the standard goes from "this person never gets sick" to "there's a group of people who never get sick, what's up with that?"

  like obvs you can imagine a person who noticed it early on and started studying it but i'm trying to stay away from that sort of contrived observation and instead go with: every year there's a % chance they're noticed as a population group, right? how many, and what % chance of being noticed, would it be to reasonably take 70 years to notice them?

  a big event in the story is US and European society learning of the "healthful" and i don't want readers to wonder "why'd it take so long for them to notice?" without a plausible answer

*** 5% actually seems pretty safe.

My childhood medical records probably still exist somewhere. But my current doctor doesn't have them or ask about my childhood history with the flu.

And once you get to adulthood, it's actually reasonably rare for people to get a flu that's so severe it puts them in the hospital.

So, from the medical systems perspective, a typical person shows up as "patient present for checkup. Reports good health in last 5 years,"

I think you might catch this effect much later on in life, as the non-perfectly healthful people who were born in 1950 start dying.

But then the medical paper might be something like, "people who had childhood chicken pox or cold sores are at 50% greater risk of death by pneumonia in their 70s"

(Figure that 95% of adults had chicken pox as kids in our world. Your change would decrease that that to 90%, with half of the no-chicken-pox people being "normal" and half having immunity to all disease"

*** I feel like you are kind of solving this from the wrong end. Like, the only answer for this kind of thing is 'when author says it is".

Like, don't let the tail wag the dog. If you want the discovery to be in the 70's for story reasons, then explain how it happened then because of X Y and Z. If you want it in the 90's, same. You can't avoid 'contrived observation' in a world you are just making up. Everything is contrived, by the author. Whatever the % chance you come up with, you are the one rolling the dice. You can say a 1% hit instantly, or a 99% missed a bunch of times in a row.
