The main character was a demon-summoning blood mage with a spider demon ally, and there was a girl who could control metal she touched. I'm having trouble finding it, any help would be appreciated.


** IT is indeed Void Domain, but the other commenter didn't post a link to it. So here's a link, and also an impromptu review of it for anyone interested (note that it doesn't really fall into rational fiction, more rational/ist/ - rational characters, irrational world type thing):

--------------

[[https://towercurator.wordpress.com/][Void Domain]] is slightly inconsistent in what exactly it's trying to /be/, and as a result comes off to me as being slightly generic. On one hand it's a story about people using magic (a "weak" magic system) to solve problems. Set in the present, it mentions the problem of magic being superstitious and mostly hidden from laypeople, but doesn't really explore it. Similarly, it touches on social acceptance, using demons as an analogue for minorities in a sense, but doesn't explore this theme in a nuanced way. That said the overarching thread is morality, and how that develops in different characters with different motivations (and how different personal systems of morality conflict with each other). It's competently written and moves at a reasonable pace, and is also complete, so you won't have to wait on any cliffhangers.

*** I prefer the author's other work, [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][Vacant Throne]]. The MC is refreshingly likeable IMO, and it's a better take on the isekai idea than most. In Void Domain, the whole "magic is hidden from laypeople and nobody really knows about it despite it being extremely useful" turned me off the story a bit, but it was something else I can't really put words to that has made me drop it. Just wasn't enjoying it. Maybe how it was generic, like you say.

**** It's actually not, in that the story has aspects of the masquerade being broken in the climax, but it's just unexplored as the MC is more interested in goofing off and powering up than interacting with literally anyone. Even the characters she's "friends" with are people she doesn't want to interact with if she can.

Not only that, Literally none of the main supporting cast care a single iota about anything but themselves and one or two other things, and because of that, it means they default firmly to jerking off in magic circles instead of being interesting.

The author has vastly, vastly improved so much, and I think the biggest thing to note is that in Vacant Throne, unlike Void Domain, they decided that when they chose their MC, they made sure she wasn't going to spend the entire story only interacting with people to make them go away.
