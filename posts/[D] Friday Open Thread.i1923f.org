Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

*** I think this is related to the observation that [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/09/23/survey-69-of-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-infographic/#7b8c0ac81ae6][69% of Americans have <$1k liquid savings]] sitting around, which has always struck me as rather strange, but maybe most of those people just have high limits on the credit cards and it only takes 2-4 days or w/e liquidate investments (esp. stable ones like bonds)? It's always seemed like a headache to have to manage all that, though, so I've always tried to keep $5-10k sitting around in a bank account in case I need it in a context where credit cards are not accepted. As a result, I never really notice when paychecks come in, and otherwise have alerts to notify me of suspicious or esp. large activities.

**** I'm trying to say this as nicely as possible, but your comment is incredibly naive. 45% of Americans don't own stock. I would love to own stock, bonds would be ok too! Unfortunately having a roof over my head is nicer.

Think about it this way. The Median household income is $63k. So after taxes, families are getting $48k a year or $4000 a month. The median home price is $320k, that's $1600 a month 30 year fixed at 4.5%. So your monthly income is now $2400. The Median car price is $31k (this figure is unreliable and hard to find); about 600 a month. So now that's down to $1800. Next we have groceries. The USDA says that a moderate plan for a family of four is about $900 a month. So now we're down to $900. Then there's health insurance. CNBC says that the average is $9600 a year, or $800 a month. Then we have car insurance. NAIC says that is on average $1k a year, or $83 a month. Now you're down to $16. Then, Forbes said the average family spends $1700 on clothes per year (average again, seems unreliable). That puts us below zero.

I stopped at zero, but there are other payments like house upkeep, homeowners, gas, student loans, phone bills, haircuts, home appliances, furniture, etc.

So we can quibble here or there with the fact that most places offer average instead of median, like I prefer. Obviously median results will be lower. Of course there are people that spend unwisely, but they are a fraction of the people (like me) who have no wealth because income can barely (or can't) pay bills.

But hopefully you get the impression that for half of families in the US, life is on the margins. You get sick often, have a lot of mechanics bills, or a broken fridge, and a year's savings go out the window. And if more than one happens, you can get into a liquidity crisis spiral.

***** I appreciate the clemency, especially in response to a perhaps too hastily written or tone-deaf comment. I was mostly speculating as to why I personally might keep so little in savings, only weakly generalizing to the broader population.

Otherwise yeah, what I'd be curious in is a finer grained breakdown of Americans' spending habits. How much of paycheck-to-paycheck living is due to financial illiteracy vs. informed variation in priorities vs. unforeseen, faultless emergency expenses kickstarting positive feedback loops that further and further entrench poverty? It's also unclear to me how much "personal responsibility" to assign to different sources of financial struggle, when it comes to e.g. eating out vs. meal prepping at home, recreational drug use, lifestyle-related health expenses, and insolvent pregnancy. And difficult not to view example budgets as lower class versions of [[https://twitter.com/MarketWatch/status/1178369905244229633][this]].

In the breakdown you gave, it sounds like the primary investment vehicle in play is real estate, which is inherently rather illiquid. If one prioritizes that over e.g. index funds, it seems straightforward to not have much intermediately available cash. I guess refinancing a mortgage is always an option, but I'm not sure how long that takes. I am a bit surprised at the car number, too, since I'd expect the majority of cars to be used econoboxes. Even new those tend to sell much cheaper (a few years ago we bought a brand new Toyota Corolla for ~$16k, largely because of recently introduced safety features; otherwise, we'd have opted for something costing even less, as the cars we'd owned in the decade prior were were quite reliable and purchased for $4k and $2k each). And clothing too -- I've always wondered what people are spending these sums on, esp. when they don't appear to be dressed all that lavishly. Is it, like, extortionate uniforms for their jobs? I've found I can generally outfit an entire wardrobe for maybe a few $100, and with care and upkeep it can last several years.

(fwiw, I'm nearing 30 in the US and have never made more than the low $40k's each year before taxes, mostly making like $10k-$20k annually throughout my adult life, which includes the last ~2y. But it's always felt like a rather lavish income, since it affords me a lifestyle way in excess of what I had during childhood, and big expenses have been easily cut via stuff like having roommates, not eating out, and taking cheap vacations by e.g. primarily sleeping outside and hitchhiking everywhere. This is also admittedly without any major health expenses or children)

****** So first off, vehicle numbers are horrifically hard to parse. I found a blog post with a breakdown that seemed decent but no way authoritative. I think mortgages are an inferior investment opportunity, but one that immediately improves your life by granting you control over a place you spend half your life.

All that said, one aspect of poverty that doesn't get talked about much is that poverty literally makes it harder to make rational decisions.

[[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/analysis-how-poverty-can-drive-down-intelligence]]

That plus liquidity crises make it very hard to get out. Liquidity crises are a real source of drain on many people. A lot of time your options are financing or payday loans; either of which increase the cost of living.

A lot of people develop a sort of monetary nihilism. If nothing seems to generate wealth, trying doesn't make sense. Short term gains then provide a "virtuous" feedback cycle. Buying things helps you feel good and ignore monetary problems, which makes monetary problems worse, which leads to short-term thinking, which makes wealth generation harder, which makes buying things seem like the only possible source of comfort, etc.

Each time they pop up and get good reception they remind people of their own fanfiction idea and encourage them to go for it. So the surge is due to a couple of feedback loops that encourage people to make, find, and post the content right now.

I'm pretty happy with the trend, the first few were "disappointing" in that I thought it was a main story update but the stories themselves have been good.

This has also made me realize the WtC update plan is my favorite, we get big chunks of content and huge amounts of discussion at one time. It let's us get really good discussions that I don't think we would have if the content was more spread out.

***** Here's my friend's response:

#+begin_quote
  1) Resources that homeschoolers/unschoolers use vary widely from person to person. Many unschoolers reject the notion of "providing avenues" and prioritize free exploration, using the world and everyday life as their "toolkit," over everything else. A major part of a lot of unschooling/homeschooling is to have the student take the lead in determining what they want to learn and how they want to learn it. If they want, they might use resources like textbooks, TED talks, workbooks, people to talk to, novels, articles, etc. The amount of freedom the student has in choosing what they want to focus on varies from case to case -- e.g. some parents might be totally fine with it if their kid wants to do art all day and rarely/never practice handwriting, some might try to get the kid to do both.

  Some good resouces I've used are Junior Great Books, the workbooks You Decide! Bill of Rights and Editor in Chief from the Critical Thinking Co., the Murderous Maths series, the Horrible Histories and Horrible Science books, and the Life of Fred math book series. Be warned LoF takes a conservative, religious tone occasionally, but if you don't mind or can ignore that, it's nice and covers everything from arithmetic to calculus and beyond. The websites edX and Coursera are great for children and adults of any age who want to take interesting courses.

  2) Right so this can be hard. Facebook posts can help you find other people. You could post that you are looking for other unschoolers/homeschoolers to form a secular group with. Indicate the kinds of activities (e.g. go to the playground, have a math circle, have a book club, sing songs) you want to do in the group and where you want to meet. We tried this and it worked! There's also something called an umbrella group that would provide guidance and maybe a social network, but I don't know much about those.

  3) I don't know.

*** I'd never heard of "unschooling" before, thanks for bringing it up here! The name reminded me of people who homeschool their children to avoid letting them get "brainwashed by the liberal/athiest/satanist education system" I'm really glad that isn't what this is.

I've always had a theory that a lot of the geniuses of the 20th century were due to a similar learning philosophys/realities. A lot of them were taught by private tutors for individual subjects, which I'm sure let them mostly go as fast or deep into subjects as they wanted to up to a college level (like their tutors) early on. A lot of them also learned by default from books, meaning that their upper limit for their own learning would be sky high.

At one point I tried to figure out how to check this but realized the population would be tiny and massively confounded by other variables. These people largely came from families/cultures that highly value education, and are extremely wealthy. The cost of those tutors would be extremely high so a lot of the benefits would probably wash out by trying to compare equal money spent on other education styles.

I'm not optimistic about how the sudden switch will work out, but we are living in a golden age of widespread education resources through the internet. I just hope the sure to be poor management of online learning doesn't set back online education as a whole after the pandemic.

The American education system is composed of a lot of things; teachers are not the people who serve as the primary driver of its behavior.

I'll go further: teachers are by and large the only thing in the current US school system that I don't think is a tire fire. Everything else, from how things are funded to how things are structured to how they're administered and how staffing is done? All of those things are not about teachers on an individual level.

When I shit-talk the system, those are the things I'm shit-talking.

I'm on vacation and notice this a lot eating out. A diner for example with $7 pancakes that chargers $1.50 for fruit on top like a sliced banana. A ice cream place with $5 shakes that charge $0.50 per tablespoon of each topping added in.

Put a rod of this material reaching from one planet to the other, and push it up and down just like a Morse code tapper to transmit information. The force is transmitted through the rod instantly, and the movements are therefore instantly repeated at the other end and can be decoded.

However, if you can break down people into information and reconstruct them from it, this material could be used to transmit the information describing a person faster than light and so enable FTL teleportation by using the information to reconstruct them at the other end.

*** I've been on this sub long enough to generally believe any breakage of physics can be exploited for FTL. At first glance this appears to be easy to use for limited range FTL travel. That being said, I'm sure you could leverage that material into more physics breaking materials.

Maybe post it on Saturday's munchkin thread? Or look for munchkin discussion of "dungeon keeper Ami adamantine" for a fantasy material that sounds similar. I'd appreciate links if you find good discussions, I'm on mobile so digging is difficult.

The idea of FTL cable lines is pretty cool for a setting too. Attacks anywhere on the line would be devastating to reception and broadcast points...

**** would a simple, but stupidly long catapult (basically, several miles long lever) made of Indestructium, not work well enough for an FTL device? Accelerate one end to near FTL speeds, the other end goes FTL.

*** *make a catapult out of it?* If you had an indestructible material, you could say cast a 100 mile long, one micron thick rod out of it, with a hinge on one end and a giant bowl on the other end. (I assume that the indestructible material is cast and then settles into indestructibility, or it would be useless).

Now, grab hinge end of this super giant lever, and apply some incredible force to it to make it swing at as close to the speed of light pas possible (use nukes perhabs?). the opposite end of the lever would swing at several times the speed on the hinge end, thus being FTL.

Now the problem is, the sudden acceleration would probably absolutely crush anything that sits in the bowl, unless also made of Indestructium.

*** I mean, unless someome here is a secret super scientist no versions of ftl would require that.

The mechanisims we think about preventing ftl would not be aleviated by that.

Might have been in a game that way though
