** (from comments looks like this might be an unpopular opinion) I feel like Leaf came off really badly in this chapter, and I am on the fence about how intentional this was. The entire conversation about battle sense, the emotional mapping, etc, all had Leaf coming in from the premise that she just *cannot* be anything but moral and logically perfect on these issues. She attacked Red's stance on Sakki from a position of Red being emotionally biased on the topic without ever considering (or Red raising) that she might have the same kind of biases in the opposite direction. She never stops to go "ok, let me listen your stance and map out how you feel on this issue, so I can understand", but instead is always on the offensive, while Red writes down a map of his own reasoning for self reflection and proposes the psychic sharing to try to understand her stance. And she gets constantly angry at him for his disagreements with her, while also sortof...looking down on Red, like her statement that he is guileless - should could have said honest, or emotionally open, but she instead portrayed it negatively. Leaf was ignorant of her own weaknesses and did not respect Red as an equal in this chapter.

Red himself never calls her on this or thinks these things, but instead keeps trying to resolve things to her liking while easily caving on her own reasoing. Now he obviously has some hella motivated reasoning going on, his feelings for her blind him and he isnt standing up for himself, thats all valid. But almost nowhere in the chapter is there any sense that Leaf has any self awareness of her own faults here, and combined with Red's lack of awareness I am suspicious that perhaps there isnt *intended* to be any, and I am supposed to see Leaf as being "in the right", which I cant get behind.

The future will tell though, I am sure! If future chapters involve some level of Leaf going "damn I was being unempathic/self-absorbed with Red" then 10/10, you made me acutely feel Leaf's internal biases ruling over her and Red's feelings letting himself be run over. If that is not at all the intent of the chapter, though, I guess you can count as one small data point of "this chapter made me think very poorly of Leaf" for the purposes of feedback.

Edit: I think it jumps out the most on the Sakki because Leaf is talking about something she knows *nothing* about. Its a psychic-battle-technique, two things she has little to no experience in, and yet her confidence about how dangerous it could be is absolute. She has a very strong bias against any form of battling, but cannot herself condemn it, so she overcompensates on subtopics where such strong condemnation feels safer, and also with Red who she knows wont say no to her.

*** I don't think this is entirely fair to Leaf. I get the impression that Leaf doesn't realize how much power she has over Red, so it's not exactly bullying when she goes on the offense here. After all, she's seen Red and Blue go at each other in a similar way, so why shouldn't she? I also don't think that "guileless" is necessarily a negative sentiment. I've heard the term used positively as often as negatively, because "guile" implies dishonesty and is not always a desirable trait. I don't see her looking down on Red, just strongly disagreeing with him.

On the whole though... Yeah, Leaf isn't really being fair. I hope she realizes it or gets called on it eventually. Neither of the viewpoint characters see it though, so it's understandable why it doesn't show up explicitly in the narrative. We do seem to be heading towards a sequence where she may see the /sakki/ used to help people, so I'm hopeful.

**** I certainly dont mean to imply that Leaf is some terrible person or anything, just that she is being unfair right now. If that is the narrative, then its totally fine for people to have those flaws, I am just commenting on them. Though I think there is some level of authorial intent I am interested in - like, there is a gap between a /character/ judging a person and a /narrative/ doing so, if that make sense.

While Leaf doesnt know about his romantic feelings, I think friendship feelings are enough for her to push harder than she normally would. I would have to read archives, but I dont think she has ever pushed Blue or Aiko the way she pushes Red, and I think its because her and Red are closer than the other two so she feels more comfortable pushing. Which is fine on its on, but combined with how her topics are about his morality and her aggression on them, to me comes off a bit as taking advantage of their friendship. Red and Blue do and have fought, but its not normally about 'you /must/ do this', its about tactics or ideas (and they have hurt each other when its not, they arent paragons!).

Good to know about guileless though! I always read it as a nice way of saying "sucker", but if thats not the universal reading I will adjust my read of that scene accordingly (though its not solely that word choice that gave me the read).

***** I feel that the reason she pushes Red so hard is because at her core she is pragmatic and realizes both consciously and not that Red is the only person she knows whose views she can potentially change. She probably has a lot of experience of failing to change the views of others with regards to her views on Pokemon and so shys away from those arguments with anyone other than Red. Red is so uniquely self-reflective that even without the friendship I think she would treat him differently than others.

Right after she feels his deep-seated and realistic distrust of Pokemon, she targets, subconsciously I believe, his most emotionally vulnerable point and tries to leverage it to force him to view his own emotions as incorrect. Regardless of whether she was correct, throw that at someone when they are feeling what she knows he was just feeling is incredibly manipulative and pragmatic as a method to change someone's mind.

I don't think that she realizes that deep down she is more pragmatic and cut throat about human emotion and beliefs than Red or Blue, but I feel that she has always acted as such subconsciously. After all, we see time and time again that she holds her cord beliefs sacrosanct while trying to change those of Red through subconscious emotional manipulation. After all, she makes unsubstantable emotional claims rather than logical ones (since those are also the only types of claims she can make) as her bassis to make Red change his behavior and worldview.

I say all of this while not thinking poorly of her. I think that she is earnest and means well, but is severely lacking and self-reflection and wow she has much self-doubt, she doesn't attempt to target her own moral superiority or core beliefs with it. We can see the gap between them in perspective in this chapter with Red's openess to changing his core beliefs if he concludes he is wrong and her unwillingness of attempting to do so.

*** I got the vibe throughout the chapter that Red was caving super easily, and that his feelings for Leaf had resulted in him wanting to be proven wrong not so that he would learn, but so that it would mean that she isn't wrong.

I don't think the intent of the chapter was for us to be on Leaf's side, and I also don't think it was for us to be on Red's side. Both of them were very clearly fucking up on the whole being-rational-thing. Leaf wasn't caring to examine her own beliefs, and she wasn't paying enough attention to notice the...it felt almost like desperation, coming off of Red. And while Red was certainly willing to entertain the notion that Leaf's mindset had an element to it that could be valid and unknown, he flinched away from his own base biases so hard that I think he might have whatever the rational equivalent of whiplash is.

What I got out of the chapter is that both of these characters are trying to be rational, but neither is there, and honestly, neither are even trying hard /enough/.

*** I feel like that fits the characters we've seen built in them. Red is always doubting himself and reanalyzing his own views while not necessarily questioning the core held views of others especially Leaf. Throughout the story Leaf hasn't really tried to examine her premises at all, so I feel like this is very fitting for her. She often times asks if there is something wrong with her, but it always comes from the perspective that she inherently is more moral, whereas caring about Pokemon as much as she does might be the inherently less moral position since it positions humans less important compared to Pokemon than others do.

This is not meant to denigrate her, merely to point out but she has not practiced self-reflection in the way Red has. She has realistic human faults just like all the characters in this story.

*** I think since the author is capable of writing Red, he's aware of how he's portrayed Leaf in this chapter. What I got from this chapter is he's trying to characterize Red as more self-aware than either Leaf or Blue, and how sometimes self-awareness means fully considering someone's reasoning when they aren't willing to extend the same courtesy.

#+begin_quote
  Red feels like there's an iron ball in his gut. He wants to insist that he is different, though clearly he's not, or that there's nothing wrong with her, but he can't think of a way to show that rather than just say it. "Maybe if... if you try to explain again, from the bottom... like your base values, what you're building from and why they matter?"

  "It's no use, Red. I think you just have to feel it yourself, or it won't matter."
#+end_quote

Leaf is clearly just shutting down at this point. I don't think it's possible for the author to write this dialogue without recognizing that.

The question of "is the character acting irrationally because the author is irrational or just good at portraying what irrationality looks like?" is a fair one. Up to this point, I feel the author has done a good job of demonstrating that he knows what a self-aware character looks like, and so it's easy for me to give him the benefit of the doubt here.

*** Popular enough of an opinion to me. The entire first half of this update had me thoroughly /disgusted/ with Leaf. There's no way for me to see her as being "correct" here, but she just assumes that her way is right and that Red is 'wrong' or 'broken' somehow because he disagrees with her, even after he goes through the process of detailing his own feelings and reasoning.

I don't know whether to credit the author or not, because I don't know if this is intentional--are we /supposed/ to agree with her views? Or is she being setup as the crazy person she seems to be? She seems to be a caricature of those hardcore vegan/PITA types who view all animals as perfect and any human who would use any product of them a monster. She neglects the massive cycle of life that is nature and she looks down on the "sakki" without realizing that it's just a temporary removal of training and allowing them to act fully on instinct. Either she doesn't grasp that such is the nature of things, or she willingly disbelieves it because she can't accept any other way but her own.

I also find it amusing that she doesn't want Red to 'change himself' with his psychic powers, but she /absolutely/ wants him to change his mind to her way of thinking based on her persuasion. It's like it doesn't matter whether he even is her kind of 'right' unless she is the one making him that way.

So, yeah, congratulations to the writer. I thoroughly despise the character, and she's arguably the least "rational" of the lot.

**** I think it's rather the oposite. She thinks pokemon are just trying to make their way in an unforgiving world juts like humans are. She doesn't think they're perfect, but she does empathize with them.

Leaf isn't the person who pets the lion because "kitty". She's the person saying the dumb-ass who tried to pet the lion deserved what he got for provoking the lion when the ranger want's to hunt down and shoot the "man eater" before it "strikes again".

She understands that pokemon are dangerous, and that the only effective defense against wild pokemon are tamed pokemon. What she doesn't like, are how most people are so selective and arbitrary about their empathy. A trainer can love their Pidgey, and cry over its loss in a battle, but also order a plate of roasted Pidgey for dinner. What she hadn't realized until touching Red's mind is that otehr trainers aren't actually empathizing with their pokemon, and that what they're feeling is more like when someone anthropomopizes their car. She also dislikes battling for sport because she thinks it's an unnecessary risk, and the difference between having a trained guard dog vs dog fights.

I think that's why she thinks Red is broken. She was taught that empathy for your trained pokemon was good, and she knows Red is a lot more sad over-all than she is. So (correctly) thinks that his objectifying/othering of pokemon is a consequence of his grief, and that he'll never be able to empathize with pokemon the way she does unless he deals with that first, and (incorrectly) concludes that most trainers are more like her than like him with regards to empathizes/othering their pokemon.

Also I think her dislike of red's sakki (and Aiko's replication of it) is actually based more on a perceived lack of informed consent. Leaf doesn't think Red is adequately impressing the risk on the trainers he's having help him with it, and that he's possibly under estimating said risk himself. She thinks it's similar to agreeing to a fencing match when one side is secretly using a real sword instead of a practice sword. What Aiko is doing is even worse as one of the few safety mechnisms in red's approach is the real-time monitoring of a Psychic which Aiko's method lacks.

**** It's not that she thinks that Pokémon are perfect, or that any use of them is wrong. It's that it's a temporary remove of training that allows them to act on instinct, just like you said. And the reason they have training is because Pokémon acting on instinct ends with dead humans that often. If he's misjudging the risk at all or the ease and speed with which he can reimpose the training, he could easily be responsible for a Pokémon killing a human. We've already seen that that's a capital offense, and there's no due process involved. That's definitely something that should arouse concern. Spreading the concept without at least going it over with a more experienced psychic is absolutely irresponsible.

***** I disagree in pretty much every way.

She doesn't like them being used as food. She doesn't like them being used as tools. She doesn't like them being used in battle when trained. She doesn't like them being used in battle when the training is suppressed. Her 'inner view' of them is of these happy, loving, fluffy things. There are plenty of people in reality who have this sort of view, and when they put it into practice, they get eaten by lions (because "KITTY!") or mauled by large grazers (like moose and cattle) or even get a nice dose of rabies from a feral cat or dog. And, honestly, they deserve it.

Despite her worries about Red and his fear, at least his fears are justified. He uses those fears as a motivator to not screw up. She's making up things to be afraid of. She has numerous examples of Red's careful testing. When he has failed at testing something, he revises his parameters. She knows nothing about psychic powers, but is willing to trust random psychics over his word. She literally lives in fear of something he has discovered and acts on that fear by urging him to stop testing. He made a point to not test it on humans. He did not intend to spread the concept until he could provably make it safe. He is handling it in a mature and rational fashion. She is not.

She is the irrational to his rational.

He minimizes exposure and duration to the effect to the mon he has tested it on, and always ensured there were other people around to help. No one else has demonstrated the technique.

Therefore, Red *IS* the expert. He is not acting from a motivation of fear. Leaf is.

Which she vehemently rejected, factoring into his instinct to withdraw.

**** Sure, he ran away because he was ashamed of scaring her. But before he knew that, Red still rejected Leaf's assessment instantly. He offered to send a different emotional state to prove that the grief is always there, because he wasn't taking her seriously enough to realize that that was also Leaf's prediction and the "test" wouldn't actually discriminate between their ideas. She outright tells him that immediately after she refuses. Even when he was reflecting on it on his own, it's always "My powers scared her," without a single thought about “My mindset scared her."

***** Ah, that's a good point that his offered test wouldn't be effective. I didn't give enough thought as I should have into that part.

Mm, I still want to say it's a little different from what you're describing; I sympathize with that snap reaction where if I see something that seems obviously off, I'll just reach in quickly to adjust it (and of course, I'm pretty sure there's been many times were I was the one who was wrong). So I don't think Red's reaction means anything in terms not respecting Leaf's opinion as much as he should, given that he did try to step through it after Leaf's insistence, and he was allowed to only partially step through it before his emotions made them separate. I guess it's arguable whether not taking the time to curb that first instinct yet counts as "being twelve", though.

And uh, I don't think you can say he was thinking "my powers scared her" more than "my mindset" if it was the grief he regretted unloading onto Leaf. I'm pretty sure the grief isn't a metonymy for his powers, in this case.

#+end_quote

To Red, I think it /is./ His literal first explanation is, "That's just how it always goes with my powers. The grief isn't related to what we were thinking about." To him, the grief is from his powers, not from his thoughts.

I'm not criticizing Red for messing up the mindmeld, or for not communicating well, or for needing some space. That's all understandable. I'm criticizing Red's post-mortem analysis:

#+begin_quote
  he didn't think to stop and recognize how his grief might feel to her, how unused to it she would be.
#+end_quote

Leaf just isn't used to it the way Red is. Red is familiar with the grief, and he has it under complete control. Red's mistake is that he didn't predict that it would falsely look out-of-control from the outside.

#+begin_quote
  He should have gone slower. Should have taken the time to examine what was so hard about mimicking her state of mind, recognized that his partition had weakened too much, insisted on waiting.
#+end_quote

He'd been using his psychic powers a lot, so his partition was weak. Use psychic powers, get grief. That's just how it works. Sure, it's a bit troublesome, but the pain isn't a natural part of his thoughts, if his partition weren't so weak.

#+begin_quote
  He can't leave her. Not like this. If he does, she'll just... go on thinking that he's a monster. He has to stay, to show her... show her how he can stop eating pokemon, how he can stop using the /sakki./
#+end_quote

If he leaves, then she'll just go on being wrong about him. He needs to appease her in those obvious superficial ways. He could have thought, "He has to show her how he can control his negative feelings," and he didn't. That's what he should have thought even if he's sure she's wrong, because that's the actual thing that hurt her. This is the most damning omission that makes Red look immature to me.

Red regrets that he made Leaf experience the completely normal emotional cost of using his powers. At no point does he consider that the grief might be a part of his self, even to dismiss the idea. He deflects her concern at every point.

I gotta say I feel like Leaf was being kind of unfair to Red. Here he is, willing to accept and potentially incorporate aspects of her beliefs to his own and she can't even be bothered to do the same. It isn't even a matter of letting bygones be bygones, she feels like she HAS to change him. I really hope that Red doesn't just drop everything to impress a girl.

** It was interesting to see the different thought process in Leaf and Red's evaluation of pokemon. The way that Leaf thinks about pokemon is very inwards-out. She thinks first about her own pokemon and how they make her feel and expands those feelings to pokemon in general. Red on the other hand is outwards-in. He takes a more objective approach listing qualities about pokemon first and then brings that back to his own experiences.

This was very good characterization by portraying how and why they value what they do.

Leaf feels such joy from her own pokemon that she understands that all pokemon can possess those qualities thus all pokemon deserve to live and be respected.

Red sees that pokemon are amazing creatures. They are lovable and dependable but at the same they they are different from humans and these qualities that make them different are cool but dangerous, a danger that has caused the death of loved ones without any moral reason and therefore there must be boundaries.

Overall, great chapter!

On the other hand, I cannot imagine the story continuing in such a way, since it'd feel like interrupting the group's Pokemon Journey..unless something like Aiko's helping out at the ranch in the evening could be arranged for him?

Leafs anti-battling attitude is just wrong.

***** Okay so first of all: whether Red is right or wrong is irrelevant to the fact that from the evidence of this chapter, Red's /thinking/ is warped. I wasn't talking about whether Red was right, I was talking about how the chapter just /told/ us that he views Pokemon as threatening, misshapen, alien, harmful and resents them for killing his father...which is a warped reason to be okay with eating Pokemon. What Leaf saw in his mind was something scary, not something well reasoned.

Secondly, I think it is actually very possible for an entire society to be warped by cycles of abuse and trauma. I would argue that many of our real-world social problems are actually caused by precisely this. In-story, the entire society could irrationally hate pokemon due to the danger and death they cause, and it would still qualify as warped moral reasoning.

Finally, when you compare them to animals, I think you might be dismissing the real moral questions a bit too quickly given that there are serious real world moral philosophers who object to various real world arguably practical and necessary uses of animals as well.... and then consider that Pokemon seem to be at least as capable of affection as dogs and at least as capable of performing tricks on command as cetaceans (and the jury is actually still out on whether or not cetaceans are sentient, they do pass the mirror test).

#+begin_quote
  most Pokémon we see genuinely like their trainers.
#+end_quote

I mean, they do get a lot of simulations of love from their trainers in the pokeball. It's not really real. I'm sure dogfighter's dogs display affection to whomsoever feeds them too, yet many societies /do/ condemn dog-fighting (although of course, dog fighting has no compelling link to human safety)

** From the standpoint that it feels like Red's general attitude to pokemon seems closer to the norm than Leaf's - acknowledging that that this judgment mostly goes off of gut instinct, and the sense that not many people at all are vegetarian like Leaf - yet people can't all have been chronically affected by deep grief and loss like Red has, I'm inclined to say that Red's right, and that while his mental powers had difficulty copying Leaf's mental state - whether because the powers themselves can't work with two polar opposite emotions at once or because Red's mind couldn't intrinsically comprehend Leaf's state of mind, and so can't pull of a good copy - I don't think the grief had much formative influence in Red that contributed into making up what he is now.

Though I do think it can go either way, really. I would say it just depends on whether that mental partisan of his is more akin to the stone walls or to the hired guards of the asylum - it's one thing to see that creepy building in the distance, it's another entirely to be surrounded by the people who's seen what got locked up in there.

*** Hm... not a typo per se, but I thought this exchange was confusing and I had to read it a couple of times:

#+begin_quote
  "How long?" Blue demands. "How long before it's ready? I... damn it, I already wiped Kemuri's ball... why haven't they already announced this?"

  "I don't think they know." Red notes his own surprise; he hadn't expected Blue of all people to want to bring back his pokemon instead of get a new, top shelf mon. But after further thought, it makes sense: Blue has never wanted to be seen as taking an easy route. That he proves he has what it takes himself to train and raise the best pokemon. "Honestly, I'd be surprised if they even know what's wrong. If it turns out to be trivial, maybe they'll be ready in a year or two. If it turns out not to be, well... a decade, maybe a bit more?"
#+end_quote

Blue asks two questions; Red answers the first one (with no acknowledgment of the second), but then his thoughts about his "surprise" immediately turn to the statement about Kemuri, and only then do we go back to his thoughts about when the tech will be ready, showing us what his first statement was referring to. So first I thought he was answering the second question (wrong); then I thought he was surprised at his own answer to the question (also wrong); then I read the rest of the paragraph and was confused and had to reread the whole thing.

** This doesn't really belong here, rather [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8v078q/rst_pokemon_the_origin_of_species_ch_57/e3fz1gz][here, in the previous chapter]], but I've come soliciting help from people who have finished the previous chapter:

I've stopped reading at the problem about =the story of how General Hideyoshi fooled the Mori clan's undefeated psychic warlord at Himeji Castle into falsely believing that he was surrendering?=. I don't want to read on and =admit to ignorance without at least trying to figure out the answer=. But I must ask before hand - is it even possible for me to work out the answer? And important follow-up question - does it rely on mechanics of the story so far, or if I happened to know a perfect psychic in our real world (no Pokemon world), would it work there too?

**** Ah, I'm allowed a messenger. I guess I'd lie to the messenger then. Although if I was a psychic I wouldn't accept anything except the word of the general - is there a solution involving the general themself?

***** No, you got it right. And it's pretty normal for a general to do things through subordinates. If sending a messenger will work better than going in person, you can do that.

** This is a really interesting chapter.

I find myself really disliking Leaf's attitude though. She pretty much assumes that her opinion must be right, and that Red is lacking something. I'm not sure I agree; especially since in the psychic link it seems as if she reached into the "other side" of Red's partition. Kinda like if she'd just encountered a kid version of Red who'd just lost his father in the most traumatic incident of his entire life, and she was judging who he is now based off of that kid version. I'm really interested to see how this one plays out, since I really do feel that this is a really interesting character conflict. Red seems really willing to discuss and bend to other's views when they present them right, but I feel like Leaf was, and now she...isn't. Gonna be really interesting to see how Leaf's attitudes to pokemon hold up after an encounter with a Storm God.

** Honestly I'm disappointed in Red's behavior, willing to throw away his Identity for the sake of a "Love" that's not willing to accept HIS Identity... I've has acquaintances who entered relationships like that, one specifically with a Vegan girl, and it always ended tragically.

Disappointing, but I guess he'll grow with time, experience and pain.

Change isn't the same as throwing away, though. From his perspective, seeing how Leaf feels is simply a way of gaining new data that can inform his worldview, albeit an unusual kind of data. Updating your viewpoint based on new information is not throwing away your identity at all.

***** I read it differently. To me, his motivation doesn't come across as "This will give me a better chance of dating Leaf," but rather "Leaf is an amazing person, so her worldview is probably a good thing to have more of."

** Loved the chapter. The way that Leaf thinks about Pokemon brought up something that I don't know will be touched on much: Are all Pokemon subject to the same legal protections?

We saw that Blue would have gotten in serious trouble for doing harm to his Shiftry (cutting off its arm), but would the same be applied if he did so to a Beedril? Are bugs and mammals given the same protection in this world, because they certainly aren't in our world.

Then there's the inorganic Pokemon like Gastly and Beldum. Are there laws against Ghost-Type Pokemon abuse? Are Beldum and other Machine-Based Pokemon viewed as lesser animals than Organic Pokemon? I know i'm posing a lot of questions right now, but I really think it'd be something that wouldn't be brushed aside in this world.

It would be especially cool to know how Leaf views the non-fluffy/ non-vertebrate Pokemon, as most people who care for animal rights in our world don't typically ascribe those rights to animals such as insects and arachnids.

This part... their talking and arguing... their feelings... it all felt so real. And magical. I just... And then Zapdos. This is too... this is more than I could have ever hoped a pokemon story to be. I swear, if you get to finish this story, I will print it into a book just so I can have a hard copy

** I love this chapter, because it's the first one to really, truly bring up *that I can remember) what I was expecting to be a much bigger issue; how do normal people live comfortably in a world where psychics exist? Leafs fear of having her views unnaturally swayed seems to me like a phobia that should be a lot more widespread, especially if it turns out that psychics actually can do things like that. Psychics are already a seemingly required part of their criminal justice system (if I remember a renegade chapter correctly), so a psychic conspiracy could, from the get go, already wield significant influence, and so far it seems like the only viable counter to a psychic... is another psychic (unless Red's assumption on how the Silph CEO kept his mind safe, and all of Red and Leafs conclusions on why all those psychics were on the boat, are wrong).

This was touched upon in the chapter about Red's mom, and now again by Leaf, her protege, but I would be surprised if psychic-phobia isn't a big in-universe issue that Red doesn't begin to run into a lot more as his powers develop.

Unless of course I'm wrong about all of this, and little telepathy-detecting gadgets like the one Bill had are actually really common, and/or there's a really easy move Dark Pokemon can learn that can completely block mind-reading, or something like that.

**** I think it's more like, in our world, there's very, very little popular fiction (especially for kids) about evil jew-like characters manipulating the banking system. From Leafs comments about how psychics were treated badly in one of the regions, I'm guessing stuff like that used to be thing, and now talking about it again, or even exposing kids to it, looks incredibly racist, because it's something the 'psychists' use to say to justify their actions, or something like that. Though if psychics could change view unconsciously, it could help explain how the people in the pokemon world got so damn pro-social. But I don't think psychics can do that, to be honest. Or at least, I really hope Sabrina told Giovanni if they could, before he decided to experiment in making human-pokemon hybrid god. Also, if psychics could do that, how could they have a history of being treated badly? If Leaf can think of it pretty quickly, without even being psychic, then I can't imagine it taking very long for an early psychic to do so as well, and quickly start making people be at least "ok" with psychics.
