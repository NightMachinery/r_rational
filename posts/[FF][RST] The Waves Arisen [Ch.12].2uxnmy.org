** From here on out I'm just going to assume that if a named, canon character is introduced in place of a generic character they will be killed off bluntly, shortly after.

Just so we're on the same page, is nature chakra in the context used here of the same type as nature chakra used by Sennin/Sage Mode, or will that be referred to as sage chakra?

Naruto's obliviousness to Hinata's attraction to him is starting to seem a little forced, though. Given the short life expectancy and the fact that apparently only ninja-ninja pairings are likely to produce "viable" offspring, I'd expect that young ninja would be encouraged to pair up ASAP. Guy is only ~26-27, and Lee at least ~14-15 given that he was ahead of Naruto and at least in canon delayed in his entrance to the academy, so for Guy to be plausibly romantically linked to Lee's mother, pairings would have to be expected in the 13-16 range. Without a cultural taboo against relationships and sex at that age, Naruto being so bookish and nerdy that he analyzes her motives and possible courses of action when she discusses things with him seems a bit much.

Did you read/watch canon? This level of density is nothing!

More seriously, starting a romantic relationship right now would be a pretty bad idea anyway, so he may be willingly ignoring the hints. Even if he is not, expecting a nerdy kid, who did not have that many friends, to pick up on this, when he has a bunch of significantly more important issues (like staying alive) occupying his attention, is a bit optimistic.

**** Nerdy kid or not, Naruto should be hitting puberty relatively soon if he hasn't already, and the effect that would be expected to have on his priorities shouldn't be ignored. One recurring criticism that's leveled at HPMOR is that HJPEV simply isn't a normal child, he's mostly an author avatar Fixer Sue with a few instructive character flaws, and the story is saved mostly by the problems he's facing being much harder than canon.

Rational fiction seems to be drawn to young adult/shonen-like stories because they exist in worlds where individual skills and abilities can have an outsized impact on the world, and at least in the case of fan-fictions, canon-established focuses on growth and self development along those lines.

I'm worried that there may be a tendency to pattern off of HPMOR and take it as simply okay for the protagonist to be strangely devoid of any of the usual foibles or downsides of youth because HPMOR did it.

HPMOR is obviously not the kind of story, where you'd expect to see an average Joe as a protagonist. It's a story about extraordinary people wielding extraordinary influence over the fate of humanity, so this kind of criticism puzzles me. It's like criticising stories about Miyamoto Musashi on the basis that he's simply not a normal adult, but mostly a Swordsman Sue.

Perhaps this is because extraordinarily rational people are expected to keep a handle on their hormones and not allow them to skew priorities to catastrophic degree, when matters of survival are at stake? I'm no expert on child soldier psychology, so I can't say how true to life Naruto's behaviour is, but I did not see anything terribly implausible so far.

***** His character flaws are not instructive. Rereading HPMoR let me see exactly how flawed and mistaken Harry has been. The first time around, it seems OP because Harry is simply smarter than a majority of the readers and knows it, but retrospectively you can see the flaws that Harry has both overcome and fallen to. He is actually very childish at the start, and he's remained quite childish.

***** No. It sounds like a simple Mendelian inheritance where one gene is responsible for all of the ninja-chakra abilities which makes sense if such a gene is artificially engineered (there's a couple of chapters in HPMOR about the same idea about a single gene being a marker for magic).

From the comments about ninja-ninja pairings producing ninjas and ninja-civilian pairing producing mostly civilians, it sounds like the ninja gene is a recessive trait. Recessive traits frequently skip multiple generation and act as if they will disappear in a few generations which is why we have people who think [[http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/genetic/redhead-extinction.htm][blonde and red hair will vanish]] from the gene pool despite the hair colors being around for centuries. One way to confirm my theory is to check whether or not civilian-civilian pairings has ever produced ninjas. This does occur, because otherwise the Academy would be only training clan children and Sakura Haruno wouldn't be in the Academy at all.

*** Gen is presumed to be Orochimaru, one of the previously mentioned Sannin. He is a legendary ninja, incredibly similar to Voldemort (they both have a snake theme going on, a lust for knowledge and immortality, and the whole ability to body snatch thing). In the manga, he stole the body of Gen and used it to found the Village of Sound (though in canon I believe he didn't hold the deception very long). In canon, Orochimaru gives Sasuke the curse mark to tempt him into coming to Sound for a powerup, so that ultimately he can jump his soul into Sasuke's body and finally gain a Sharingan (the others being in Itachi's face, a difficult place to get them from, or previously killed by Itachi).

Orochimaru's goal is to learn lot's of jutsu. Sharingan is very useful for learning jutsu. Orochimaru (in the manga at least) can jump his soul into another persons body. I'm sure you can see the implications.

Note, the fact that they're going /too/ Sound /away/ from Leaf and that Naruto thinks this is their /best/ option is a huge bit of dramatic irony. The audience is, I suspect, supposed to know that Orochimaru/Gen is bad news bears.

**** Given that /everyone/ in this universe seems to be at least a bit more rational (except maybe Lee), I wouldn't be surprised if Orochimaru was actually Naruto's best hope for Fixing Everything. Correctly persuaded, he's a Library of Alexandria of lost jutsu, where any one of them used alongside "nigh-infinite chakra capacity" might produce a foom.

If that was what was on the table, I can imagine Sasuke could be easily convinced to give Orochimaru one of his eyes in trade. (It's not like Orochimaru actually needs both of Sasuke's eyes, let alone his whole body.)

(And that's just Orochimaru on his own. If Naruto manages to "get through to him" in the way he frequently manages with various villains in canon, I could imagine getting all three sannin on the project.)

Orochimaru always seemed to me like someone who was just resorting to "evil" methods for lack of anyone who appreciated his goals, and would cooperate with him. In this much more grey-and-grey morality universe, where Naruto is already a missing-nin, Orochimaru wouldn't be a villainous foil to Naruto's intent; he'd be more like a failed-at-the-same-quest mentor, in the Mazer Rackham sense.

Well, Sasuke also copied the motions of writing in the exam, but that could be by the original, 'automatic' ability or just by being able to see detail so well as to be able to copy the movements.
