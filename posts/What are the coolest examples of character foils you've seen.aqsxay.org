I put myself into a corner where I need to come up with 21 "foiling" connections between characters and it's a little overwhelming.

What I have now:

Immortality seeker v. Suicidal immortal

Absolute trust in parents v. Hate for parents

Planner v. Improvisor

Individual love v. Duty to family (two couples, one starting out dating, the other in an arranged marriage for 20 years)

Traditional v Progressive

I have some gaps in what I want some of the remaining characters to be like and Im trying to use this to decide.


** On the topic of well-executed foils (as opposed to just laundry-listing ideas), one of my favorite set of character foils is Bean and Peter from the Ender's Shadow series. Both Bean and Peter stand in Ender's shadow; Peter because Ender was his brother, and Bean because Ender was his commander. Bean doesn't particularly mind working from the shadows, but for Peter, working in the shadows is a necessary evil, and he eagerly anticipates the day when he'll be able to debut on the world stage.

Bean detests status games and hates politics. He is always single-mindedly focused on accomplishing his mission, and because he's not particularly charismatic, he's found that allowing other people to take credit for his ideas results in them having a better chance of being accepted.

Peter recognizes that status and political capital are resources that can be used to further his long-term goals. In pursuing his short-term goals, he often takes the route that will cause him to come out looking the best, sometimes allowing situations to grow worse so that people will be truly desperate for his help and he will receive greater praise for his success. Peter is committed to his "mission," but he thinks a generation ahead while Bean is thinking a week or a month ahead.

Bean grew up as an orphan on the streets of Rotterdam, often unsure where his next meal would come from, so his optimization for short-term outcomes seems pretty natural for him. Peter grew up in a relatively affluent American suburb, where the norm was "study to get good grades so you can get into a good school and get a high status job," so his focused on long-term thinking (optimizing for what his career will look like in 30 years) seems like something he was similarly conditioned for.

One of the reasons that Bean can get away with ignoring status games is that he's a military leader, and the military follows a strict hierarchy: there's no need to try and pass yourself off as high-status when you always know who your superiors and subordinates are. Soldiers will obey him because of his rank even if they don't particularly like him. Peter, on the other hand, is a civilian leader, and is immensely concerned with what the public thinks of him. Playing politics is an inevitable part of being a politician.

Bean is sometimes perceived by others as a bit of a misanthrope due to his lack of willingness to glad-hand and engage in false flattery, while Peter oozes charisma. However, because Bean is so sparing with giving out compliments, people who respect Bean treat his praise as something rare and precious. Bean has few friends, but those within his inner circle are fiercely loyal. Peter is great at charming people, but the better people get to know Peter, the more they tend to find themselves questioning his motives -- even a number of people who are his strongest supporters do so with a sense of misgiving.

Peter and Bean are pursuing the same long-term goals, but because of their differing values (and approaches), they frequently butt heads throughout the series, and characters in the story react to them completely differently. If you try and reduce that dynamic to how they differ along a single axis (like how Peter is a civilian while Bean is a soldier, or how Peter was a child of privilege while Bean grew up in abject poverty, or how Peter is obsessed with prestige while Bean hates status games), and focused on that to the exclusion of everything else, I think you'd be losing something important about what makes those two characters such perfect foils for each other.

If you have a dichotomy of "poor character vs rich character," it would probably be more interesting if their conflicts revolved around the second-order effects that result from their levels of wealth, as opposed to just making the conflict about how one person has more money than the other. For example, "nouveau riche vs old money" could make for a more interesting contrast than "poor vs rich," because the conflicts that arise there are less about "one person has money and the other doesn't," and more about the second-order effects of being born into wealth as opposed to having earned it.

*** I'd never thought of the series like that before, thanks for putting in the effort to write all that up! I think that's legitimately changed how I look at the characterisation of those two.

** One way to generate these is to pick a personality system, then pick 2 of the types within that system, and identify something basic that they disagree on.

For example, Hogwarts houses.

Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff: decisive moments vs. gradualism. Great things come out of a key heroic moment vs. out of a gradual accumulation of efforts.

Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw: action vs. thinking. You get good results by doing the things that matter vs. by thinking about what to do.

Gryffindor vs. Slytherin: virtue ethics vs. consequentialism. You get good results by embodying what's right and good vs. by scheming about what actions will lead to something good.

You could try coming up with contrasts between all the pairs of houses (not necessarily limited to one contrast per house pair), and you could try with other personality systems.

** World weary v. excited for the future (usually with old v. young respectively. I don't remember an inversion of this offhand.)

Skilled/experienced in self defense/armed v. pacifist. (Haven't seen, but it seems a reasonable contrast. Similar: Military v. civilian.)

People who focus on physical strength v. acquiring knowledge/honing 'mental' skills. (Common enough to be subverted occasionally.)

I'm also curious about sets of 3 or more v. just 2.

** I adore it when traits of the main character can be found in either the main character's friends, or their enemies.

Full spoilers for Worm and Ward: Goddess was an awesome foil for Victoria. They are described very similarily: Powerful women, with several superpowers, among others flight, strong defenses, and an emotion-affecting power that pre-disposes other people towards liking them. They both like to take charge of situations, and act as leaders. However, while Victoria mostly thinks of herself as a Coach or a guide for the younger heroes, Bianca explicitly wants (needs) to be in charge. Years of people bending to her will have left her unable to stand any criticism. It's possible Wildbow wanted to explore how a more authoritarian version of Vicky could have looked like, minus the trauma from Amy of course.

Spoilers for Twig: Sylvester's foil is Jamie/Jessie. They are the only member of the Lambs Sy has trouble emulating, predicting, or manipulating. Sylvester is fluid, impermanent, unable to retain memories for long; J literally doesn't forget anything. J is always the voice of reason, reining in Sy's exuberance and his more self-destructive traits. Sylvester relishes in causing pain and terror; Jamie even felt sorry for Sub Rosa when they had to kill her. And despite these oppositional traits, their friendship is basically the best thing Sy has in his entire life.
