** Oh, for fuck's sake, this is the worst timing possible.

Thanks for the link. Really, there's nothing that makes a writer's day like knowing that people are actually reading their work, /like/ their work, and even want to /share/ their work with other people, /but/ aside from the fact that even though I asked for some feedback on this story in this subreddit, I really feel that it doesn't belong here (admittedly, most of the stories submitted here don't belong here), the real issue is that I'm posting today the last chapter of what is essentially a long-winded, pointless, badly written prologue /and then I'm going to rewrite the whole damn thing starting tomorrow./

So thanks. Really. It feels /awesome/ knowing that someone likes what I write. But your timing simply happens to be horrible. Also, it's not rationalist fiction. Korra's fucking /stupid/.

** Legend of Korra rationalist fanfiction -- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uatnn/developingscientistkorra/][original post here]].

I have been following this story for a while.. By far the best Avatar fanfiction I've ever read. I loved how writingathing portrayed Korra's isolation in the South. The realism they brought to the story exploring the full potential of the setting.

They've also been rewriting the chapters based on the feedback, so you might want to read from the beginning instead of where you left off if you've read before.
