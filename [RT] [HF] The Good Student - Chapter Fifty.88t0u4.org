** Simole and Nic going on wacky adventures could be a series of its own and I would read the shit out of it. Hands down my favorite duo.

With the revelation that dragons are, in a way, empty husks that can be inhabited, I'm wondering if they're related to how mages are made. Maybe a demon is split in half, with the primal instincts and body becoming a dragon, and the spirit fusing with a human, giving them magic?

Okay, so that seems consistent with our speculations regarding demon-powered limited-resource mages, [[/u/MultipartiteMind][u/MultipartiteMind]]. Female mages die during childbirth (N=2), because they're actually demons with mind transplants, and they get transferred to their children. The biggest question here is the connection between Winnum Roke and Simole... there's quite a few similarities, actually. Simole is talented in a lot of things but doesn't bother with theory, and Nic said about Roke that "everything had come so easily to her, she never bothered to try and understand what she was doing". They're both very powerful mages, obviously, not sure if the gender is relevant. Assumedly their mage mothers died during childbirth and they were mages from young age. With all of that taken into account, why would mages not want them near the Royal College?

That bit about possessing dragons feeling "like coming home" was really interesting, especially in contrast to possessing humans. Being a dragon feels more natural than being a human? Hmm. To whom? To human minds/souls, or to demons/Arcanum entities?

Assume dragons are demons. The ease with which Nic possesses the dragon is explained by the demon in him, then. What about Simole? Is she just naturally good, not requiring any help, or...?

Assume mages are demons. Simole-the-demon and Nic-with-the-demon are similar entities, then. Why are they at home in dragons, if dragons are not demons? Or does the process somehow split the demon in two, with one half turning into the dragon, and another --- into the mage? Is Simole just naturally good at possessing humans, then?

What if it has to do with human minds, not Arcanum? Humans are naturally good at possessing dragons, better than at possessing "human" bodies. What would that imply?

** Wow, ok, that was unexpected. So the Allfather is a former human as well?
