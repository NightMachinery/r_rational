** Eh, I don't particularly agree. "Having a strategy" and "Doing Game Theory" are not at all equivalent. Everyone, Absolutely Everyone, does things that they think will result in good outcomes for themselves. Game Theory, or Rational Thinking, is about figuring out the rules of how those outcomes follow from strategies at a basic level.

"If Elizabeth goes on horseback and it rains then she will have to stay the night. If she stays the night she has a higher chance of getting married." Uses logic to gain an advantage, but that's just ordinary thinking. A Level 1 play using Yudowsky's definitions.

A game theory approach would involve some amount of probabilities, or people reacting to a strategy and knowing that it is in fact a strategy. Game Theory with only one player immediately deteriorates into "pick the strategy with the highest score." It's not really Game Theory.

*** I agree that Jane going on horseback to Netherfield wasn't the best example. I think there are some better ones in Mansfield park. For example, Maria is in love with Mr. Crawford, but has already been engaged to Mr Rushworth. Mr. Crawford may love Maria in return, or he may just be flirting with her to stave away boredom while visiting his sister. On the other hand, even though Maria can't stand Mr. Rushworth, he is a sure thing and he's far more wealthy than Mr. Crawford. Maria decides to marry Mr. Rushworth, but then Mr. Crawford decides to run away with Maria- who actually loves him- rather than wait for Fanny Price to return his affection. The strategies get a little higher and more complex the more you read.

In any case, I think applying game theory is an interesting way look at any interactions where strategy and decision making come into play.
