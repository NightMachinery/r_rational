** "You solve unsolved cases. " um,,,, i would hope that EVERYONE only solves unsolved cases... xD what would be the point of solving already solved cases?

hm~~ yanno, i kind of feel bad for hector. all he ever seems to get from heroes (that aren't spinner) is either "thanks, but why aren't you doing more", scathing comments about his pay, or getting thrown under the bus if things go south. i mean, dang. even if he /could/ do more, why would he? they bitch at him the whole time and it's tedious work. and instead of praise he gets brow beat for every person he doesn't manage to get to. you would think they would understand, being heroes and all~

*** It seems to me that that is a result of Delphic's unique relationship with the other heroes.

He is independent, while the others are all part of the system. Having joined it, they naturally have suspicion as to why he won't. Unless I missed something, there isn't the focus on wages within the super groups.

Furthermore, they think of him as a super-AI, and a supercomputer that can do what Delphic can, and at the same speed, would be incredibly powerful. Certainly more powerful than Hector is in real life.

There is a TON of room for misunderstanding and suspicion, but I think that over the years, Delphic would become one of the team.

**** that is a thing, but even if delphic /was/ an AI entity, there are very good reasons for him being a mercenary:

computer hardware costs money, and if he lived in hardware that was not his exclusive property he would be giving up /his body/ to his patrons. unacceptable.

his contractor status allows him to only take as many cases as he is able and not be forced into more cases than he can handle.

the bounties also limit the kinds of cases that are given to him. if you hand the fbi the google of investigations they'd start relying on it for a lot of things that they could do themselves.

he has always been forth coming with his abilities and the FBI practically thought he was an employee... so,,, idk why he's considered "unregistered" anyway~~

the wage comment was mostly about pereguine (i.e. LL's besty) being strongly against him taking money and also the whole interview thing claiming he's profiting off tragedy.

actually I'm pretty sure this whole conversation was brought up by lady liberty. refraxx did say that /harmony/ told him that delphic only worked a handful of hours. so she's just stiring up more crap. after allowing him to be blamed for the bank fiasco. hmph. i really dislike her.

** 'unreversed the flow of time' is an option.

(I like the relation of the title and initial part to the final part!)
