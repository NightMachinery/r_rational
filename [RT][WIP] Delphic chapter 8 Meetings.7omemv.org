** The story itself is tantalizing, though short. One part I found unrealistic was the main character's failure to make a move on May. It would be realistic that the reason they aren't having sex is she said no, but not the way it was described.

Another problem I found difficulty suspending disbelief with was that the main character is one of the greatest computer experts who ever lived? Yet he has to waste time each day with a day job as a cable installer? He has a superpower that perhaps allows him to steal passwords, but nothing that would allow him to type faster or analyze data faster or any of the other things you'd need.

I finally will note that it's rare for the same techs to work on both electricity and internet. Also not realistic for a lone tech to be fixing things like main power lines.

I feel weird with these nitpicks. If you'd said the main character /also/ can interface with computers with his mind, that part of my disbelief would be suspended.

You, uh, don't know many nerds, do you? It's entirely in-character for him to confabulate a reason for her to not want sex or a relationship with him, and then believe that. If he uses his powers on her, he could even be correct - but the power imbalance of using his powers (and fighting the urge to use his powers) to pursue a sexual relationship makes the whole thing fraught.

Hector is probably sexually messed-up in all kinds of ways, just as a side effect of that superpower. Voyeurism is the obvious outlet.

It's a "cover job", to stop him from being outed as Delphic. Presumably he's laundering Delphic's money somehow ([[/u/9adam4]] - the TV series Ozark is excellent for ideas on this).

I do agree with you in principle - he's wasting his time with a cover job. Even if he can't look forward in time, with his powers it would be trivial for him to day-trade the stock market based on shorting or going long on major decisions made in boardrooms far enough away that news of the decision takes a few hours, or a few days, to propogate to the rest of the market. He could make enough money as a "lucky" day trader to build up a modest stake for himself, say $2M, and then live off the interest. $2M will make $40K at 2% withdrawal more-or-less indefinitely, investing the rest to CPI increase. A person can live modestly on $40K, if they don't have to do anything at all for it.

He could even move to a low cost-of-living country, say Peru or Thailand, and probably be physically safer. His powers would let him "keep contact" with his few loved-ones, although they can't keep contact with him.

Hector's probably socially messed-up in all kinds of ways, too.

I personally know several small-business electricians who do that sort of contracting, mostly for commercial and residential property managers, builders, etc. There's a lot of these type of businesses around, usually one or two guys and a van, maybe the owner's wife does the invoicing. It's a fairly standard business model for all kinds of things - plumber, refrigerator tech, aircon tech, etc etc, and it works very well with business networking groups. (Hector doesn't seem like much of a networker, not that he really needs to be.)

***** It occurred to me yesterday that just as physical supers with a major power (speed, strength) get a bunch of unconscious and overlooked minor powers as well to keep their major power from destroying their bodies and the environment, to let them see while running, etc etc - supers with mental powers should get unconscious minor powers also to let them have that ability and stay more-or-less sane and functional.

It would be very easy for someone with Hector's ability to just descend into catatonic dream, remaining forever an observer, watching the interesting lives, the interesting places. The ultimate couch potato tourist, not even needing the physical TV. Even a moderate interest in a sport could be indulged endlessly.

You haven't covered but I expect you've thought about his limits, in terms of space and time - can he look at the moons of Jupiter? Can he watch dinosaurs? Could he solve all of the archeological mysteries of the world? Does his power automatically compensate for the rapid movement of the Earth through time and space (rotation, orbit around the sun, sun's orbit around the galaxy, galaxy around the local cluster, etc etc)?

** Thank you, I'm enjoying this story!

A question: Police training involves quite a lot of team and partnered physical training - they practice takedowns, team catch-and-carry, firemans' lift, first aid including revival of unconscious people, they are tazed and pepper-sprayed, they practice combat with batons, etc etc. It would essentially be impossible to make it through police training without being manhandled, for want of a better term. How did Paris make it through this without someone else noticing that she feels like a "warm, cloth-covered statue"?

Couple of proofreading pickups:

Ch 6: "We came to a pretty quick decision, and I pulled a small handheld unit and *a* bit off my tool belt." (Otherwise it reads like he took a bite out of his tool belt.)

Ch 6: "“And Mrs. Anders *has* been watching Deb during the day so I can work. "

*** Am not the author, just speculating, but Paris could theoretically have a fellow trainee or two she confided in who kept her secret. That's at least possible, my nitpicks are more towards things that aren't.

*** I agree that the questions regarding how Paris made it through training undiscovered are interesting ones. I have answers, but I'm loathe to go into them because they may come up in the story later (some aspects almost certainly will be, while others may not depending on how her arc progresses).

I presume it's not too frustrating to leave the questions open until I either cover them or get past any spot where they might be covered?

Are you sure it wasn't Lamarck? A weird way to describe them both dying.

Took me a bit, but I think you mean "Lamarck had flown in the previous day for a visit..."

Though I'd also be happy if "flying to in the precious day" became a saying.
