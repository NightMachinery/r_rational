[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena/chapter/435999/chapter-thirteen-teamwork][Chapter 13]] just went up. This work by [[/u/Gilgilad7]] is a tale of survival in a litRPG setting. The "players" need to optimize their decisions to live through the day. They also must struggle with their own natures, and expand their knowledge of the world and its sufficiently advanced technology through trial and error.


** The skill system looked pretty ideal for a wiki, so I've [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Arena_Wiki][started one]]. Feel free to add in!

** Opening another thread here to discuss the system that we've seen so far.

The game encourages specialization. For example, EPs get a double hit from a player's Prime Element. Due to the way EP recovery works, this amounts to an extra 1 EP recovered every hour, when compared to other elements.

- Some skills are also restricted to a Prime element. If a group of players want that skill, they must include someone with the right Prime.

- Helping other players with their injuries enables the First Aid I skill and awards NPs.

- Honoring a fallen ally results in 1 NP (it isn't clear if this is a one time bonus).

While the Tutorial Guide offers players the option to go at it alone, the system itself seems to heavily favor team play.

It seems that gathering food for others does not generate NPs, however, making this task suboptimal for personal growth, and therefore undesirable.

It may be that there's a different intended method for acquiring food.

Maybe Nathan should try planting some nuts, yams, or such? This seems a likely equivalent Wood-themed skill to the /Ignite I/ skill Maya acquired in Ch.12. In effect, turn surplus EPs into food.

*** I don't think you need spoiler speculation, or things that have happened in previous chapters. It's only when discussing events of a different work that they're necessary.

Gathering food may not be optimal, but I do not think it is as burdensome as you make it out to be. Considering that neither Nathan nor Asahi received additional bonuses from their continual uses of their skills, and the general trend in what earns skills and NP, the nanites are primarily interested in novel actions and feats.

Right now, they only have discovered a few different ways to earn accolades outside of combat, as you've mentioned. Healing another, communicating across a language barrier, starting a fire, using a polearm, and making a shelter. Once everyone who can meet their requirements acquires those skills, it will be a matter of creativity to figure out what else will grant bonuses. As long as they continue to share their skill unlocks (skill hoarding will probably be how trust breaks down in the group) then people who focus on foraging won't be at a disadvantage.

Once their healer gets enough MEN to use their skill, the most interesting question will be whether skill effects stack additively, multiplicatively, or at all. The answer to this will really determine ideal builds, both individually and team-wise. Nathan briefly mentions in Ch12 that he doesn't want to waste a First Aid on Zheng when he already is buffed with it, so we can at least assume another application of the same skill only refreshes its effects, and doesn't add another instance of it.

The most idealistic interpretation would be that different skill effects stack multiplicatively. The 3x healing rate from First Aid and the 6x from Advanced Healing would become 18x healing, so over the course of its 12 hour duration a wound would heal for the equivalent of 9 days. Power Kick's 1.5x attack power and Attack Up's 1.2x would make a 1.8x bonus.

Somewhat worse would be an additive stack, where a 12 hour duration from First Aid + Advanced Healing would heal a wound for an equivalent 4.5 days, and the attack skill combo would only be a 1.7x bonus.

In the former situation, it would be better in the long-run for players with self-targeting skills to distribute their upgrades equally, double-dipping in EP for significantly more power. In the latter, there would be less incentive to do so. And in the worst case of skill with overlapping effect categories only applying the most beneficial/earliest effect, it would further cause players to specialize into their most powerful skill, since upgrading another skill with the same effect would be pointless.

**** Nathan experimented with /Attack Up I/ skill and determined that this skill, at least, did not stack with itself. That said, I think your idea to experiment with /First Aid I/ has merit. It would be worthwhile to see if the same buff from another player can stack as well.

** Damn, I wish serials like this would provide character sheets. Once a week is just long enough for me to forget everyone's abilities.

*** This is a reasonable request so I'll start doing it for Nathan. Thanks for reading. :)
