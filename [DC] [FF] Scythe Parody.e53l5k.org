Okay, none of the below will make sense if you haven't read Neal Shusterman's [[https://www.storyman.com/books/scythe/][Scythe]].

Despite the relentless mocking of its premise below, I actually love it. The characters are gripping, the twists are thrilling. The insane worldbuilding is all in service to the story, and you probably couldn't tell the story if you demanded it all make sense.

Its just the most anti-rationalist setting imaginable. Strange rules and institutions exist because they are needed for the story, even if there are strong reasons for it to work differently. Its explicitly pro death, of the "Death gives life meaning" variety. Those scythes that I describe below? They aren't the bad guys, they are the protagonists, defending the noble and sacred institution of Sythedom from a new wave of scythes who are doing their murdering in an insufficiently somber manner.

But the big thing is that I just can't imagine how the system was ever initially put into place.

--------------

The president had ran on a platform of firsts. Be the first to put a human on mars. Be the first to institute a particular policy. Instead, the only thing that matters was that he was the last. Well, the last president that was going to matter. Thunderhead might let people hold elections. He just wasn't going to let the president hold any power.

Thunderhead couldn't be stopped without scouring the whole earth clean of everything with a circuit board. That wasn't going to fly. Not when he was so benevolent. He had, after all, beaten death. The revival centres could cure most fatal conditions, physical age could be set to whatever number you felt like.

Concerns about overpopulation gripped the world, as did a rabid conviction that Thunderhead would not be the one to decide how humanity dealt with it. A machine would not, would never, decide how humans were born, or how they died. Such a sacred duty must be left to humans.

So the Mortality conference was born. All nations attended. There were no computers whatsoever. Thunderhead was coerced in supporting the results of the conference, but he wasn't allowed to show up. The representative from Norway had to get his age reset, because his electronic pacemaker was deemed unacceptable. There weren't even any phones.

So when the United States Ambassador returned to the Oval Office, to give his report to the Last President, the Last President had no idea what he was going to hear.

PRESIDENT: Report.

AMBASSADOR: ...

PRESIDENT: *Report*.

AMBASSADOR: You know, at the time, when we were drafting this plan, everyone was really excited about everything, really proud of what we were doing. But looking back, I can see how an outsider might be, uh, confused at some of the particulars.

PRESIDENT: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. Are there death panels? There are going to be riots if we try to install death panels.

AMBASSADOR: No! No.

PRESIDENT: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. That's a relief.

AMBASSADOR: There aren't death /panels/.

The president glares at the ambassador, who has suddenly found the walls and ceiling to be very interesting.

PRESIDENT: What am I about to sign? Because we both know that I have to sign it. Refusal to sign would put America at war with the whole world, and at war with the strongest thing next to god. I told you that before you went.

AMBASSADOR: There will be... individuals... who can tell the revival centres to not revive specific people.

PRESIDENT: That's a death panel! They are denying life saving medical care! It will jeopardize an awful lot of the goodwill Thunderhead earned if people don't know that the revival centres will bring them back!

AMBASSADOR: Technically, its not a panel, because its just one person. Each death will have a personal touch.

PRESIDENT: If I have to explain that technicality to the people, I'm going to have to do it again to the senate when they remove me from office. How does this individual decide who does and doesn't get revived?

AMBASSADOR: In an unbiased manner! We were pretty happy about that part.

PRESIDENT: ...

AMBASSADOR: ...

PRESIDENT: Okay, I'm gonna need you to describe that unbiased manner.

AMBASSADOR: What do you mean? I already have. "In an unbiased manner."

PRESIDENT: That's it?!??!

AMBASSADOR: That's it! Its too simple to subvert!

PRESIDENT: Who decides if they are "Unbiased" or not?

AMBASSADOR: Don't worry, there is a process.

PRESIDENT: Okay, we will get back to that in a minute. How are these individuals even selected?

AMBASSADOR: They take apprentices, who then have to pass a test.

PRESIDENT: What! How long do they retain their powers?

AMBASSADOR: For life! Which is /forever/ because we're all immortal now. So really, it lasts until the despair of killing people drives them to suicide. Its poetic as [EXPLETIVE DELETED]

PRESIDENT: That's an aristocracy. What you are describing is a new aristocracy with the power of life and death, and to choose its own successors. I literally can't do that. The constitution prohibits giving noble titles, and this position is functionally one, even if it isn't actually one.

AMBASSADOR: Oh, it comes with titles as well. They're called "Scythes". We thought it was the right mix of respectable, mysterious, and badass.

PRESIDENT: Okay, your minute is up. I'm going to need that process for determining if a Scythe is "Unbiased"

AMBASSADOR: The Scythdom will be a self policing organization! They will meet in their conclave, that no one besides them is allowed to enter or see recordings of, and popular vote among the scythes will decide all internal punishments and policies.

PRESIDENT: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]!

AMBASSADOR: Hm?

PRESIDENT: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]!

AMBASSADOR: Okay, you definitely said [EXPLETIVE DELETED], but I'm going to need you to explain yourself.

PRESIDENT: You've created some secret society of murderers who aren't accountable, even in theory! I can't even call it corrupt, because the abuse of power seems like its the /point/ of this system. They're basically above the law!

AMBASSADOR: Hey, chill. First, they are /explicitly/ above the laws beside their own, and second the Scythe commandments have like, three whole sentences about how they aren't supposed to be corrupt. They are barely allowed to own things!

PRESIDENT: So they are just supposed to sit in their supervillain lairs all day, living like monks, deciding which patients shouldn't get revived?

AMBASSADOR: Oh, hmm, you seem to have misunderstood something rather badly.

PRESIDENT: Oh thank god.

AMBASSADOR: The scythes take a more... active... role.

PRESIDENT: What.

AMBASSADOR: These aren't cloistered bureaucrats! They are walking out among the people, they decide who to kill, and then do so, personally. People they kill can't be revived.

PRESIDENT: h-how?

AMBASSADOR: How do they kill them?

PRESIDENT: How did you agree to this, but I will take that too.

AMBASSADOR: They do it however they feel like. knives, guns, plane crashes, fire. Whatever they think is appropriate, or are in the mood for.

PRESIDENT: but that-

AMBASSADOR: I know what your thinking. "What if someone resists being murdered by fire?" We thought of that too. If someone does resist being murdered, the scythes permanently kill /all of those persons loved ones!/ Its a fantastic deterrent.

PRESIDENT: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]!

AMBASSADOR: ...

PRESIDENT: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]!

AMBASSADOR: ...

PRESIDENT: [EXPLET-

AMBASSADOR: Look, you may not like it, but this is what humanity has chosen.

PRESIDENT: I... am *never* letting humanity decide anything ever again. From now on, the AI is going to call all the shots.

THUNDERHEAD: All according to Keikaku.

** I only read some of that book and I also got out with the impression they really should have let the ai handle it.\\
I even thought the setting was so stupid it could only be parody with the intention of making people realize death is bad but that didn't really seem to fit.

** Generally-speaking I love Neal Shusterman. He tends to take very non-rational premises and expand on them in super rational ways.

/The Schwa Was Here/ is my favorite. It's basically about a kid with Imp's power.
