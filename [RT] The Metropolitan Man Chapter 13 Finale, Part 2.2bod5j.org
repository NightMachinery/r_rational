** And that's the end. I'm submitting this one late at night after editing took longer than I thought, so hopefully I haven't missed anything too major and the number of spelling/grammar errors will be low. If you've got any questions that aren't matters of interpretation, I'd be happy to answer them either here or in a potential epilogue. I tried to think of everything, but sometimes it just didn't get put into the text because I didn't think anyone needed to have three paragraphs of Superman talking about how he stole a piece of kryptonite from a research lab.

Edit: And thank you so much to whoever gave me gold for this post! Also for all the comments over the last two months, and the help with fixing typos!

***** Define near future. I have some original stuff that I need to finish up, but I'm not sure whether I want to serialize any of it. Not making it serial means the whole thing would be released as a lump sum a few months down the road - serializing would mean that the first chapter would be up in a few weeks. I haven't really decided which one I'm going to be working on, but it's either:

#+begin_quote
  *The Timewise Tales*

  Fantasy. The world is one giant stable time loop, and some people can traverse it with varying degrees of ease. Follows: Ellebeth, a coffee shop girl who gets stuck in a patchwork city following one of the time storms; Wendel, her boyfriend, who vows to reunite with her; Issah, a scholar who has seen his fate and wants to avoid it. First draft is complete at 90K words, but it needs serious editing and some plot tweaks.
#+end_quote

Or ...

#+begin_quote
  *The Wayward Souls*

  Fantasy. Detective Jan-Fong dies, and two hundred years later his soul gets put into a new body so that he can help solve the attempted murder of the king. It's a fish out of water story that takes place in a pseudo-Chinese setting, with a lot of focus on souls - which actually exist and are readily apparent as this white glob that falls from your mouth when you die. First draft is at 46K words - I know what the end looks like, but I'm having trouble with the connective tissue.
#+end_quote

Or ...

#+begin_quote
  *Vampire, Wizard, Robot*

  Fantasy. Set in 1970s New York City, where vampires have the headquarters of their new world government. The story follows some young wizards, the last of an ancient order, as they combine arcane knowledge with computer science to make robots that will hopefully beat the undead. First draft is at 20K words, meaning it's got the longest time to completion.
#+end_quote

One of those three, but I haven't decided which, or whether I'd want to write it all as one lump sum or split it into chapters to post once a week (or faster). I'd appreciate any feedback on which of those sounds most compelling - my hope is to actually get one of them published in dead tree format at some point, and that means looking at marketability.

*** Maybe a good epilogue would be a conversation between Jor El and Luthor on their respective visions for the world? The whole technological advancement thing is somewhat ominous, given that the whole theme is that one man having unlimited power is dangerous for the world.

So my question would be what sort of technological advancement would Luthor pursue? Is the world going from having a moral but apathetic superhero caring for it from an immoral involved supervillain?

**** I just realized that I never answered this question. Sorry about that.

At the end of the story, Lex has a huge number of research facilities, a super suit, a spaceship, and possibly some samples from Superman's corpse (it should be assumed that an autopsy was conducted while the body was surrounded by kryptonite, but I didn't really want to lose the narrative focus by making that explicit).

The research facilities go to work on all sorts of areas, with a preference towards those areas that can help lay the groundwork for future science or multiply labor. That means agricultural research, engineering, materials science, and communications. Beyond that, he'd put a heavy focus on getting into space as quickly as possible, since the existence of Superman implies the existence of other aliens (though the fact that this is the first time in a very, very long time that an alien has visited earth means that there's some breathing room). Atomic research is a focus, both nuclear weapons and nuclear power, especially given that other people are bound to be following those paths. Same goes for cryptography, which eventually leads to computing.

But most of that would get delegated to other people, since Lex has a bunch of stuff that he needs to keep very careful about sharing - the Kryptonian technology. It's got a working computer that wasn't actually shorted out (Superman lied about that for his own reasons) which can be used to communicate with Jor-El, materials that are foreign to Earth, the ability to slide through space at higher than light speed using the Phantom Drive, the creche that was used to fabricate baby Superman (and also the suit), and some other stuff like the sensors used to gather data about the planet. Much of it has been intentionally limited, but some of it can be reverse engineered. Lex would go about this carefully, and not share any of the technological advancements unless he was certain that they wouldn't lead to some other dangerous technology (balanced against the need to get humans onto a second and third planet as fast a possible).

I hope that's a complete enough answer for you.

*** One is tempted to ask why Superman overlooked putting Kryptonite in the lead walls. After all, this involves a moving a fairly large amount of something bright as sun into Lex's house and sudden vanishing of it.

One can argue that Superman isn't able to overlook this even if he tried to; Kryptonite just is too noticeable.

I'm not that person I'm referring to; I'm playing a Devil's advocate here. But still, I would be interested in some handwaving addressing this.

PS. I greatly enjoyed your work. The characters are intelligent, interactions are believable, both Luthor and Superman look like people who belong at LW meetups, and I still unsure about Bad/Good Guys of the story, which is something you were clearly aimed to achieve --- and succeeded.

**** The kryptonite was put into the lead panels and then shipped to Metropolis for installment during the renovation. Lex doesn't discover kryptonite until after Superman has dropped into full-time Clark Kent mode (where he was waiting for his nemesis to make a move), and since the research facilities in Blüdhaven and Dos Rios are beyond the horizon, Clark never saw them, since he spent most of his time either keeping a careful eye on Metropolis (mostly Lois, who was a likely target for his nemesis), or delivering stuff to Floyd.

So Superman doesn't learn about kryptonite until after some random guy walks past him, at which point it becomes incredibly obvious to his eyes, but by that point the new lead panels have already been put in, so the only way for him to know that they have kryptonite in them is to figure out that this is the sort of precaution that Lex would take. Lex also has a convenient excuse for the renovation lined up; he got word from a source within Wayne Industries that they had made a breakthrough in non-x-ray imaging (which is of course a piece of disinformation that he fed to himself).

Hope that answers the question to your satisfaction.

****** A few reasons:

First, geography in the DC universe has always been a little bit screwy, so the exact location of Metropolis and Bludhaven is up for debate (and never made clear in the story, especially since Bludhaven is only mentioned by name once). Most of the time, Bludhaven is somewhere in New Jersey or possibly Delaware, but it's supposed to be adjacent to Gotham City, and I'd decided that was taking the place of Chicago (because in the DC universe as it's usually presented, Metropolis is more or less where New York City is, Gotham City is where New York City is, and New York City itself still exists - which means that there are three very large cities that are basically right on top of each other, and the audience is just expected to not think about that too much). Depending on the exact location of Floyd's hole and Bludhaven itself, the flight path didn't need to come all that close to it.

Second, I guess I never made it explicit, but I always thought of Superman's x-ray vision as something that he could turn on and off. This fic owes a lot to Tom De Haven's /It's Superman!/ which describes Clark as feeling his eyes go gummy when he uses x-ray vision or heat vision - as if there's some brief physiological change going on when he exercises it. /Most of the time/ he doesn't use it, and there wouldn't be a real reason to while in transit from Metropolis to the prison. (Note that he says "What do you think it would look like to my x-ray vision" instead of "what do you think it would look like to my eyes".) I figure most of his spare time in transit would be spent listening in on conversations instead of watching the ground beneath him. He's treated as though he has total information awareness by other characters, but that's mostly because he's a mystery to them.

(Legal differences basically don't mean anything to me, as far as fan fiction goes.

He judged that if Superman ever snapped then the world could end, but didn't counter balance this with the good Superman could do. Was he right? In this story, Superman does kill one person and leave another in a hole in a ground. He is not necessarily to be trusted. But Lex does spend a lot of life to find a way to kill Superman.

Superman was, effectively, working for Lex in order to maximize utility. Unless Lex really thinks Superman was working anywhere close to his maximum QALY output, I think it's clear the benefits outweigh the risks here. (Heck, Lex himself is working in nuclear power!)

Worse still, Superman's existence implies highly advanced aliens - with Supes himself as the only weapon we have that could come /close/ - unless Lex is going to singlehandedly create the singularity over a century early, which seems ... unlikely.

** Now what I'd like to see: post end plot twist, superman's father/designer actually prepared for this contingency. Fusing the engineered organism of Superman with kryptonite only triggers the second layer of the plan, elaborated in case the original plan fails. In this second plan, Superman becomes one with the planet, and reaches his full potential as a quasi omniscient and omnipotent being, becoming some sort of oracle and source of magic for a selected few who will drive humanity forward.

Then Lex becomes Voldemort and everything goes awry again...

Anyone else very conscious of how big a loose end Mercy is, though? I was more than half-expecting her to feature in the last few paragraphs in some twisty way.

*** This story had been brewing for a while, and in the very early plot sketches, Mercy got revealed to be something other - another Kryptonian, a secret identity for Wonder Woman, Raven, or something like that at an appropriately dramatic moment (and in an appropriately dramatic way, with plenty of foreshadowing that doesn't actually exist in the text). But while I kind of liked that twist, the story needed a pretty tight focus on just the three main characters (Lex, Lois, Superman) and so I just left her as this enigma, which hopefully works well enough.

Aside from never having full insight into Jor-El and the Kryptonians (a scene that I cut because it didn't really add all that much), she's the biggest question that goes unanswered. Hopefully that works - you never get inside her head, and she never really expresses herself, but ... if there was a scene where Mercy was walking down a dark alley and some thug started to approach her, you wouldn't be /entirely/ surprised if she quickly and efficiently dealt with him, or cast unnatural shadows behind her before revealing her True Form. But the story isn't about her, so she'll remain as this mystery that sits at the periphery of the plot. Maybe she's just very good at her job.

***** Oh man, there were like ... four different cliffhanger endings that I was ready with, but I really wanted to avoid people messaging me about when I was planning on writing the sequel (because the answer to that is "whenever I get struck with an idea that I really like", which isn't really satisfactory). The short versions of the cliffhanger endings, in order of how likely I was to use them:

- Mercy and Lex are in his study, which has been renovated. Lex is reading from the Metropolis papers, while Mercy is sifting through the ones from other cities. As she's reading the Gotham City newspaper, she tells Lex that there's a masked vigilante there. Lex doesn't think this is worth his attention until Mercy reads that there are reports of the vigilante somehow creating constructs out of hard, green light. (Which would set up Green Lantern Batman for the sequel, with a layered conflict between Wayne Industries and LexCorp and an introduction to the wider galaxy.)
- Luthor connects in with the spaceship's "brain" and gets some information from Jor-El. It would probably have to be set years later, but I liked the idea of one of the computing pioneers getting their hands on ridiculously advanced technology (Alan Turing, shortly after publishing a paper on his novel "Turing machines" gets introduced to a ridiculously advanced computer). Jor-El gets bypassed, and the fic ends on "Welcome to the Brainiac system - what would you like to know?" (It never made it in the story, but Krypton was doomed by the Brainiac system - UFAI that shut down the species without them really realizing it. That was a thought I had when watching /Man of Steel/ and hearing that all of their many colonies had died on the vine. Three times, it's enemy action.)
- Mercy makes an uncharacteristic request for time off, which Lex readily grants. She goes down to the docks of New York City and boards a ship that has all female sailors, and the final words we hear are that they're sailing back to Themyscira. (Probably raises a few too many questions about what her motivations actually are - why she would help Lex, what she actually feels, etc. and would need to have just a touch more foreshadowing. I also worry that it would destroy some of the grounding of the story - introducing more of the metahuman DC universe might make it feel less like the real world)
- Someone shows up (Supergirl, Zod, Darkseid). Probably too bleak of an ending, given how fucked the world would be - I would probably have had to change current ending around to be more optimistic in order to allow for that to be acceptable. And the ending is already pretty damn bleak.

** That was...still quite well written, but I think you fumbled it a bit.

So, this whole story we've been moving closer and closer to Superman's demise. Inexorably, Luthor continued his advance. We were made to see Luthor's point of view quite well, even to the point of thinking he was in the right. Superman was going to die, and we as the audience had accepted that.

...But then an alternative path presented itself. Superman was learning, he was ready to use his power for the greatest good possible. He could trump Luthor's efforts, he could overcome his weakness and be the Superman that everyone deserved. A Superman that transcended the comic book version, that transcended cynicism. A Superman that showed everyone that it's alright to hold your morals high and have faith in a better future.

Two paths. Either Luthor kills superman for the sake of humanity's safety, or Superman survives and does his best for humanity. For the majority of the story the Luthor path seemed unavoidable. I was fine with it, it would've been a fitting conclusion to a powerful story. But when that alternative path presented itself, I so dearly wished for you to pursue it. And you came so close to pusuing it. So very, very close.

But then Mercy pulls out the Kryptonite, and it's all over. And what's worse, judging by Luthor's thoughts, he thought he'd lost. He didn't have any contingencies left, Mercy wasn't told to execute this plan, but instead did it on her own. So what would've been a masterstroke, a last ditch effort that resulted in the death of superman, comes off as blind luck. That's quite unsatisfactory.

*** It's almost definitely that way by design. It's a downer ending, because the whole thing is a tragedy. Luthor has his flaws, and Superman has this whole speech about how Luthor is really driven by his fears rather than cold emotion. And you get this whole bright future stretching out in front of you as you realize that Superman really is offering a truce, only to have it snatched from your hands and smashed to the ground.

Luthor wins, but it's not clean or pretty, and from how he repeats to Mercy twice that it was the right thing to do you get the sense that he's trying to convince himself. I maybe would have liked for it to be more explicit than it was, but I don't think I'm reading that much into things there.

If it had simply been a masterstroke by Luthor, you might have felt that he was right to have done it. The way it played out, the reader is denied the satisfaction of seeing Luthor win, and that adds to the bad taste that the ending is supposed to leave in your mouth - which is probably why the whole story ends with a man laying at the bottom of a deep hole with a broken leg and nothing but certain death.

If you're gonna write a story with this sort of moral, it doesn't seem right for things to seem so very hopeful up until the last minute.

Deconstructions are all well and good, but it burns me that we were so close to going beyond that, but didn't. More than just deconstruction, there could have been reconstruction. Tear Superman apart and show him for all his flaws. Then, at the point where it seems foolhardy to believe in Superman, turn around and build things back up. Show us that, just maybe, he can be the hero that we always wanted him to be.

He outright says in his comment that he won't answer direct questions about interpretation. As other comments have stated, I believe it's blatantly left unclear whether Luthor was right. All we know as a fact is that Luthor won, not that he was correct. We're not given a direct vision of a dying world held in the grip by a mad Superman, space rubble. We're simply given Superman's final word that he's maturing and has a head on things, countered with Luthor's complete dedication to removing the Superman as a threat.

Luthor gets more talk time because his view on things is what's on display in this story. "Superman can be a good guy and help the world!" as been discussed and heard a million times over the decades.

I do agree that it missed out on dipping into Reconstruction; doubly sad that it clearly KNEW it could with Superman's final resolution to help in the most useful ways imaginable. But this Luthor was consistent from the beginning- reading up to this point, I would not expect to see this Luthor EVER accept a truce and/or alliance with Superman, and that held true. Luthor's character, as written, kept this from ever having a real shot at Reconstruction.

Both solid endings. One showing the futility of the idea of Superman, that one person having so much power is doomed to failure, and instead we can only do the best we can as human beings.

Superman gambled everything on his own actions and limits- Luthor gambled on his plus his agent's.

It depends. I mean, set aside for the moment all of the bad things that Lex does, and the ways that he pushes Clark closer to snapping, and just think about the [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html]["existential risk"]] part of things.

Superman is an existential risk to humanity, given his power levels as presented in this fic. If we take that as a given, then the real question comes down to percentages. Lex says that if the risk is one in a thousand, that's the equivalent of two million people dead, but that's a simplification, since /all people/ dying is more than twice as bad as /half of the people/ dying, given that humanity would be ended forever and we place an enormously high value on humanity continuing to exist in some form, and existential risks don't allow for do-overs. So I think that Lex has a point there, and it's not entirely unreasonable to kill someone who poses such a large risk to humanity as a whole.

/However/, Superman also /lowers/ total existential risk, even as he raises it just by existing. He could stop an asteroid impact with ease, give a massive boost to space colonization, solve an enormous amount of problems, and stop nuclear war (which wasn't really a concern at the time this story took place).

The story is a tragedy, and it's got a bleak ending, but while Lex was at least in part motivated by an animal fear, that doesn't mean that he was necessarily wrong to do what he did. Hopefully the ending properly hits that note - you could argue it either way. It's a sad ending either way, I think, because even if you agree that Superman presented an unacceptable risk to humanity, you still sort of want to believe in him. If it weren't for the fact that an unhappy ending had been foreshadowed quite a bit, a "happy" ending where Superman puts a stop to Luthor's schemes and forms a partnership with him wouldn't have been too terribly unbelievable.

So I don't agree with Lex, in the sense that he's an amoral murderer. But if this were real life and he were in the news for killing Superman, I might argue on reddit that I could see where he was coming from when he did it, even if it makes me sad.

Hopefully that's not too much of an answer.

**** Thanks. I guess I've been kind of shying away from the conclusion that killing him was the right thing to do, because the notion that that's the case elicits in me a pretty visceral disgust. That's partly due to the loss of potential good, but there's probably a pretty substantial irrational component to the reaction as well.

** Finally got around to finishing this. As someone who has always disliked Superman while craving a better class of Superman story than the ones DC keeps churning out, I absolutely loved it. The idea of showing Superman realizing that despite it all, he's only one man and can't do everything alone, is exactly what Superman has always been missing, and him teaming up with Lex and/or Bruce to really maximize the good he does in the world is pretty much the best rational ending one could expect.

Two criticisms:

1) Lex never seems to consider that Superman, according to what he discovers about his "true" persona of Clark, ages. So unless he has a reason to expect him to just stop aging at a certain point, eventually Superman will die with or without Lex's interference: whether he'll do so before pulling a Zion is another story.

2) I do think Superman running out the wall like that was a bit of a fumble: with his ability to think and move so fast, he should easily have been able to simply stay a safe distance from the crystal as it was lobbed. A simple fix would be to depict it as so large that its effects press him up against the wall just by Mercy opening the door, showing that he really had no choice but to go through it.

In any case, thank you for writing this fantastic story, and sorry it took me so long to get to it :) Looking forward to reading more from you.

This was the thing that sticks with me as problematic. We establish that Superman can take /days/ of thought in between the words of a sentence, and yet he decides that the most prudent course of action is to bail through one of the walls. Then the Kryptonite in the wall apparently weakens him enough to be shot, in approximately a second or less. So I'm not clear on why Superman chose to flee through the wall slowly enough to be affected by his weakness.

In addition, his plan to disarm Mercy and dispose of the Kryptonite once outside would somehow be different than the method he would use immediately upon seeing her with the chunk inside?

Maybe he could have seen Mercy with the rock and, thinking quickly, ripped one of the lead-lined walls open to use as a covering or shielding for it... only to inadvertently expose himself to the Kryptonite behind the lead lining. Just an alternate idea.

I loved this story, though.

** In the end, I am left wondering if this was bigger than Superman. Of Krypton's message to humanity.

If Superman himself was the message - a controlled, demonstration by example. A mistake down the road they did not want developing sentients to make, like they did.

You left us sad, but I‘d like to think humanity passed. Thank you for writing the story.

** ""I studded the walls with kryptonite," Lex said to the empty air." stuck out like a sore thumb labeled [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow]["As you know, Bob"]], and could probably be outright deleted. It seemed too odd (for anyone, but especially for a character whose security concerns would have squelched any habit of talking to himself) to be anything but exposition, but as exposition it was unnecessary. Most of your readers probably figured out "green shards ... that Superman had taken with him when he went through the wall"; any who didn't would be able to piece it together from the discussion a half dozen sentences later.

That's my only worthwhile criticism. This is a fantastic story. Your Frozen and Terminator stories set me up with high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in the least.

(I do have one worthless criticism: for some reason Chapter 10 didn't feel as compelling or as interesting as all the others. I haven't figured out why, though, and if nobody else felt the same way then the flaw may be with me rather than with that chapter.)

*** I might take that line out, since I think you're probably right that it's obvious enough. Calibrating how much explanation is required is very difficult - the previous chapter included a line where Superman says that his spaceship is in the Arctic, which was meant to be an obvious lie to test Lois's reaction (and the flow of information), but that wasn't obvious /enough/. It's fairly likely that I'll do an editing pass and remove both of those.

Fanfiction.net keeps docs in the manager for 90 days, after which you have to go through this tedious process of reuploading from the fic itself - so I'll wait for more reviews to come through in order to identify the problems and then make the editing pass within a month. I'll keep in mind what you said about Chapter 10. I do agree there's a slump at some point, but don't really know exactly what's causing it.

**** I think the confusion with Superman saying his ship was in the arctic was because isn't that actually true in canon? Or at least he has a fortress there? So it's sort of plausible enough to make you wonder if Luthor got a decoy, or if Superman stole it back, or something.

As for Luthor's line, I think it should probably stay. I think it needs to be made obvious that he did so, more than just a throwaway line about green shards which could be confusing or have other explanations, and Luthor's been run through the mill at this point and has finally defeated his foe, and may or may not be feeling some trepidation about being about to murder him. For me that's the message I got from his random slip into (a single sentence of) monologue.
