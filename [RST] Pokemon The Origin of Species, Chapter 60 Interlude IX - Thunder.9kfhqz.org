Also, what are humans in this world? There doesn't seem to be any other normal animals in this world, just pokemon. Are these humans just a really weak normal type, that traded almost all of their ability to use moves for increased intelligence, or is humanity a whole separate branch on the tree of life?

Can you imagine how much worse class divisions would be if the wealthy legit had fire breathing dragons ready to ride around? Most fully evolved Pokemon are stronger than most Marvel superheros/villains. Thank god they have this renegade shit going on because class warfare would be insane in this universe. But then again maybe it's just some horse-riding kind of thing, the Renegade laws make it hard to use it for legit oppression but indirectly its probably a lot harder to survive in that world without pokemon of your own considering how much of a threat wild pokemon are. I mean I think we've had quite a few tier 3 events in this story already and I don't think it's been a full year yet.

But I am still curious about how the smaller city states are explained. I think it'd take a bit more convincing to say that the presence of Pokemon is enough of a reason for humans to have only gotten so far with their expanding their regions. It seems like it took them around 3 days for the two journeys between Cerulean and Brock's city and Pallet Town. That puts the region maybe at the size of Ireland? And it's not implied that the other regions are that much bigger, otherwise that would be mentioned more. We know they've at least tried to take shit over in the past, so it's not like they're peaceful than normal human.

******** Okay so you're argument is basically that humans would be too focused on surviving to actually fight each other? That sounds valid on paper, but it never works in real life. When resources become more valuable, conflict increases, not decreases. Perhaps a more related comparison would be the zombie apocalypse. Quite a bit of literature has been written on varying types of zombie apocalypses, and no matter how bad the zombies are, it's unanimously agreed that other humans are more of a threat than the zombies. It doesn't matter if they're slow Walking Dead zombies or ridiculous World War Z zombies or the unkilable Train To Busan zombies, the humans kill more than the zombies do. And humans aren't exactly great at resource management, just because a resource is valuable doesn't mean they won't throw it away for some bullshit. And as I said somewhere else, in a world where a strong team of pokemon is rare, literally one guy with a Charizard could take over a country on his own. The kids in this story right now would straight up be able to solo a decently sized village if not a city. Brock could do so with just one pokemon.

Side note, Im starting to realize the woman who wrote World War Z (and the Zombie Survival Guide) kinda predated this whole rational thing.

You are right about the charizard stuff. And Surge mentions warlords taking over regions. That would happen. But I expect they wouldn't fight large scale battles like this. A charizard would take a lot of training to control, And you aren't going to risk it fighting in open war. You just subjugate those weaker than you. Fear of losing is a powerful motivator.

You're right, logically that would be how it works. But humans aren't logical, and humans are even less logical when they're constantly under threat. Rationally, they'd be reckless with their pokemon and some would even benefit massively from being reckless.

#+begin_quote
  And you aren't going to risk it fighting in open war.
#+end_quote

Depends on what the war wins you. And these "open wars" don't have to be that large scale. Maybe these warlords get an army population in the thousands. So that's a 5K humans on each side along with maybe 40 big pokemon and 200 lesser pokemon. I suppose the humans involved would have spears and arrows. Now unless your the South humans don't usually start a war unless they think they can win. So you wouldn't usually see even battles like that, but lets say you do.

Although now you got me thinking of how humans would even far in a pokemon world without pokeballs. In the real world, humans "counter" large animals (we evolved to hunt water buffalo in Africa) and are countered by insects (no fur). In the pokemon world, our ability to chase prey down probably would not be nearly as effective, but our pack hunting and our weapon usage would still at least challenge a Tauros. Also our main counter in nature, insects, are now giant sized. Believe it or not, this actually helps us. In fact, we would probably hunt Beedrill. Any physical based attacker that is fairly large and doesn't have armor that would resist spears would be pretty good for us. Just skimming through the first gen, most bug types, Venasaur, Raticate, Wigglituff, Poliwrath, Dugong, Lickitung, Seaking, Kangaskhan, Seadra, Chansey, the eeveelutions, and they MIGHT be able to hunt flying types and fighting types. Of course with the stuff there's always the important question of how much food you get out the hunt, but considering killing two beedrill is probably more valuable now than a single buffalo was, so while many of these mons might have high risk, they also have much higher reward than our traditional prey.

*********** That seems fair.

I guess the next bigger thing is the distance between regions. The war was instigated because of expansion into the wilderness near the other region. Something that wouldn't be possible without stable regions. They don't have time to expand when they need to rebuild cities every century or so. Besides there are nearby cities to fight before inter-regional warfare.

I would say the lack of ability to build such infrastructure would prevent wars like this. At least for the most part. You have to worry about a forest fire spiraling out of control or a rampaging Onyx.

If activities in Hoenn resulted in an increased threat to Kanto from Dragonite and Gyarados, you can bet that Kanto would take action.

*** Yeah I wondered about that. I think it is the author's perogative to do some world building while we wait for GameFreak to catch up, but I think it's a little muddy here. The Inuit and Sioux are not exactly New York adjacent. I wonder if a play on the Iroquois confederation might feel more appropriate geographically.

*** Well cities have to have defensible positions to avoid being destroyed by Pokemon incidents. I imagine plenty show up and fall over time.

Being nearby to each other probably gives the region's connectivity. Which is only increased with the modern technology and safety from Pokeballs.

And when you have a safe region, why would you go to the wilderness inbetween them? The areas outside would probably be colonies of nearby regions, which is the seeming cause of the war in Unova.

** Fantastic chapter, had a lot of great world building to it. The part about Blue and Surge and the Zapdos was really well done, I wanna see more about how Surge prepared for war and whether he can do anything about Blue, but by far the best part was the beginning with the war. Seeing how war is in this 'verse is really interesting. Its also interesting to see you make up a new region. So this chapter gave a lot more insight (and a lot more questions!) about the larger scale geopolitics of this world. You've gone beyond explaining pokemon genetically and gotten to how military tactics would evolve around pokemon. At the very least, talking about whether these people are expansionist might hint towards whether humans are naturally that way or if we are that way culturally or if they simply wouldn't be naturally that way in a world with pokemon. This also kinda plays into the whole vegan thing because we probably wouldn't have evolved to eat as much meat if we weren't the Apex predator in every continent. Are all the regions in this universe small? I can't see Unova as being bigger than New York State. Do they all have a pokemon league? Is this world mostly wilderness with small pockets of strong human civilizations? Or is the entire world populated (like ours) but everything is small nation states, comparable to Europe or how the US would look if every state was it's own country. Its presumed that the power of pokemon would make large countries difficult to maintain, especially before pokeballs, but it's also implied that pokemon were still tamable before pokeballs, so war would and territorial expansion would still have existed. And Surge mentioned how entire regions used to get wiped out, so its not like regions are a new thing. But in the real world the expansion of a nation is limited by transportation, which these guys have in spades. So are wild pokemon really more of a boon to expansionist states than a lack of transportation? Again, it is possible that culturally they wouldn't be more peaceful because they wouldn't have been predators like humans in our universe were, but it probably is worth exploring.

And then how does war interact with pokemon? Being able to teleport away is huge, it makes kamikazes super viable, especially when kamikaze planes can have voltorbs in them. The fact that a hyper beam can probably bust through anything makes big tanks and big aircraft carriers not very strong. Or if those things are able to withstand anything BUT a hyper beam then hyper beam will become very important. And pokemon who can defend against those high power attacks would be super strong, being able to put a protective bubble around one of those helicopters would have been a W. And what about bullets? I presume a machine gun would rip through any of the bird pokemon, and we have confirmation that guns are a thing in the show (episode where Ash mistook a camera for a gun). Are pokemon that are resistant to metal type attacks also resistant to bullets? If so, by how much? Do bullets just bounce of Charizard or is it more like his skin is a bullet proof vest? The way that bullets, missiles, and explosions interact with the typing stuff could have huge implications on what's strong in battle.

Also I totally see you setting up for Blue to start to side with Giovanni. Giving Blue a way to kill the birds might be too big for him to pass up, and he already kinda idolizes the dude anyway. Maybe he won't go complete turn coat but I can see you're gonna do some interesting things with that.

** Eelectross brought a smile to my face, it's definitely one of my favourite electric types, alongside Jolteon. I've used Giga Drain Eelectross on Smogon to great effect. It feels great when an unsuspecting opponent counters with a ground type only to find their attacks completely ineffective and being beaten about the head with life steal.

I would have countered Surge by having Rhyhorn lead with Smack Down and quickly followed up with an Earthquake.
