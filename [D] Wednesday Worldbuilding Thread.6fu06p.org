Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Forcing a setting to abide by arbitrary rules can lead to interesting technological innovations. In most circumstances, actually following such rules is not rational (e.g., the complex automations used by certain religious groups in order to avoid doing "work" on holy days). In other settings, however, the rules may be backed up with easily-tested penalties (e.g., the /Safehold/ series' orbital kinetic-bombardment installations that will destroy any evidence of radio-wave emission on the planet's surface upon detection).

The question, of course, is: What limitations make sense? In the aforementioned /Safehold/ series, radio waves cannot be emitted because they would draw the attention of off-planet aliens bent on destroying all other civilizations. On what basis could (for example) steam turbines be forbidden, in order for reciprocating steam engines to reach their limits of efficiency (e.g., sextuple-expansion engines)? Does there exist any mechanism whereby transistors and vacuum tubes could rationally be shunned in favor of clockwork? What physical rules could preclude the development of the electric telegraph and leave the field open for its optical predecessor to remain unchallenged? (Etc.)

And, obviously, a peculiarity forced upon a setting in order to preserve one particular technology must also have effects on other technologies.

*** I'd just change the availability of certain materials compared to our world, or make up some fantastic ones. If you don't have access to the right glass or conductive material for tubes and circuits, you'll make do with the most complicated tech you can. That can be clockwork made out of a very strong non-conductive metal.

**** There's issues with trying to massively reduce the amount of certain materials selectively.\\
For one silicon is /super/ common and thus that will exacerbate the general problem that to get certain unrealistic planetary compositions will require significant rather arbitrary changes to the backstory of the setting. The composition of nebulas that form planetary systems just isn't random and so if you want the right elements to not require you to work on devising a whole complex alien biology which doesn't require certain elements (or exists on gas giants) or in some cases a magnetic field, then you're pretty limited in what you can change.

But then again that's not so much of an issue in fantasy settings. In those I usually stop tech development by having the world basically exist in the minds of the gods, which can explain the world acting in a way more reminiscent of human intuition than natural laws. However in the latter case you probably also want to change quite a lot from our own world since any world that doesn't work exactly the same as our own (or isn't designed as a simulation of it) won't realistically be without major alien features.

P.S. Depending on whether you want the setting to make sense you also need to deal with the fact that humans and many other systems bear really obvious signs of having originated via natural selection in a universe like our own. So if you want to have humanlike creatures and many other things from our world you're going to need to have /some/ sort of connection with a world like our own to explain that.\\
A solution I've used for that is having the setting have previously been like our own world in many ways, but having undergone some magitech catastrophe that led to it ending up as a magical simulations in the minds of gods. This also serves to explain why the culture isn't /completely/ alien, since I didn't want to have to build a totally new culture from the ground up that may well result in pretty much everyone in the setting having values that people from liberal western countries would find horrifying.

*** What if you turned off QM superstates in metals?

The valence electrons in metals collapse into a superstate. If I remember correctly, this helps make metals ductile. Remove the effect and their structures would look more crystalline.

This breaks high-efficiency steam turbines, since the slightly-more-crystalline steel would tend to shatter under tension from high-pressure steam. You could still do Carnot engines for some sorts of work, but they move to slowly for vehicles.

This would also make metals less conductive. We could imagine that they'd still conduct some electricity. So you could have a doorbell or something. But the resistance could be high enough that a long-distance electric telegraph would be too expensive to be feasible.

Science would look pretty much unchanged through at least 1911 or so, except that metallurgy would be slightly worse.

*** There's a series by Eric Flint, I think. Where a world administrating AI quashes all high pressure events, thus breaking/banning both steam engines and guns. All the meatbag posthumans decide to have a war, but the AI doesn't let them have anything better than pikes to do it with.

**** This sounds functionally very similar to S.M. Stirling's "Dies the Fire" (and the series that follows). Except in the latter, the restrictions were caused by a one-time magic event (OK fine, later books in the series start using more magic) rather than an AI.

*** Well, if you accept radio waves being banned because of aliens detecting them, the same can be done for steam.

Have your humans live underground, with the surface taken over by giant human-eating creatures with infrared vision. Anything to do with heat/fire is outlawed in fear that the surface creatures will notice the heat coming from the underground settlements and break in. So steam engines are no go, since they produce lots of heat.

** I find the premise of Brandon Sanderson's novella [[https://brandonsanderson.com/perfect-state/][Perfect State]] very interesting and want to use it for something. The basic idea is that people are raised in a simulated reality from birth, wherein their life ends up becoming the story of a hero changing their world for the better and earning basically everything they want. Don't worry, they're eventually told the truth.

The reason for this is because the simulation is supposed to optimize the person's happiness, so it creates challenges befitting their skills for them to surmount in order to satisfy their desires. In practice, it tends to encourage narcissistic tendencies and the protagonist has conflicting feelings about much of his life now that he's become genre savvy.

I kind of want to use this as the basis of a quest in a RPG campaign, say Eclipse Phase. The obvious hook is that the players would have to enter the simulations and uncover some sinister purpose behind it all. An idea I think is cool is that the players are professional NPCs for a more Westworld-style service and help the simulation satisfy the users.

*** What if you make them professional antagonists?

I'm the God Emeperor from the perfect state. I've hit the age where the maintainers tell me that I'm in a simulation. They have to tell me. But it creates some predictable psychological problems. How can I feel rage at a computer opponent who has been created to lose? And am I "heroic" if I know that the computer-generated suffering only existed so I could beat it?

Enter your characters.

Their job is to play the defeatable villains for despairing God Emperors.

A "standard" op is that they're invited in to the God Emperor's world. Supposedly, they're coming in for some kind of morally-neutral challenge. "Sail to the End of the World" or "Conquer the Lost Continent or something."

In reality, the challenge is [[http://planetsave.com/2013/12/23/a-rigged-game-of-monopoly-reveals-how-feeling-wealthy-changes-our-behavior-ted-video/][rigged]] in favor of the God Emperor. And the characters are told to turn themselves into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)][heels]] who will be really satisfying to defeat.

The maintainers have found that this setup helps jaded God Emperors feel a renewed connection to their world.

Only, in this mission, for whatever reason, the characters decide that they're tired of losing. Maybe the God Emperor is such a boorish jerk that they decide they'll pull out a victory. Or maybe [[#s][spoiler]]

So, your characters -- each a veteran of dozens of villainous campaigns -- decide to pull out the stops and use their genre-savvy to crush the Empire of the Light and win one for the downtrodden orcs.

**** I hadn't thought about antagonists, though it's so simple yet brilliant I can't believe I hadn't thought of it before. I had actually planned on taking this in one of two different directions, which I hadn't explained very well. Either people are putting their children into a simulation as a way of raising them and eventually bring them back to the real world, or it's the new World of Warcraft that builds worlds and stories for the customers.

I like the setting for Perfect State, but I'm not a big fan of the story since I found the conflict predictable and the resolution ultimately pointless. Maybe that was intentional so you'd feel what the protagonist did, but that's not what I enjoy reading. Instead, I want to use the same idea as a framing device for either Sliders-esque adventures or roleplaying as professional Game Masters who have to entertain their customers.

**** This is sort of the mentality of Black Knight from The Practical Guide to Evil. Villains can /do well/, but heroes /always/ stumble ass backwards over the villain's weakness, or a long-forgotten magic sword, or some awesomely powerful spell at just the most critical juncture. He wants to pull out a final victory just /once/, so that in a thousand years five-man-bands of heroes will sit around their campfires before their dramatic infiltration of the Evil Fortress, and they'll /remember/, and they'll know that they might actually lose.

** So, among a number of other malformed ideas, I've been thinking of running a pokemon RP. The premise would be that in an alternate universe, pokemon Go came out as the game we all wanted it to be-- with every pokemon, trading, battling, more granular regional distributions, etcetera. And in an alternate universe to that alternate universe, when you caught a pokemon on screen, you'd recieve it in real life, caught in a pokeball.

Why? Well, that's not really important; it's a setting conceit in the same way as "magic exists" is harry potter's setting conceit.

But anyways, the idea of the RP would be that aside from the actual in-rp interaction, there would also be some mechanic to encourage players to take their in-RP teams and fight with each other on pokemon showdown.

That's where I run into some problems, and that's why I'm here in the worldbuilding thread.

- what mechanics can I use to encourage players actually battling over pokemon showdown?
- how shluld I handle in-rp geographical distribution of pokemon
- how should I handle players aquiring new pokemon, especially with considering their in-game location?
- how should I handle mechanics like IVs/EVs/levels/Shinyness?
- how do I handle items?

My current idea is to have xp as a currency, with it distributed for making posts and fighting battles, and spent on leveling pokemon/training them/aquiring new pokemon.

I have no idea how to handle geographical distribution of pokemon though.
