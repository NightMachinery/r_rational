Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I've been trying to think through the problem of a self-sustaining lunar colony. It's not as easy as it sounds, because a self-sustaining colony doesn't just need the ability to create more air, food, water, power. It needs the ability to /make/ the things that make more air, food, water, power. And to make space suits. And mining equipment. And metal tools.

What I've got so far is this:

1) The colony needs to relocate underground immediately. Lunar dirt provides a way to retain atmosphere that can be infinitely expanded to meet the needs of the colony without requiring the continued existence of space-proof suits. This also saves the colonists from all dying of deadly radiation over years of living.

2) A sort of genetically modified palm tree could be used to extract energy from the sun. The tree's leaves are the only part that stick above the lunar surface, and are heavily coated in transparent wax to prevent a lose of water to vacuum. The tree's trunk is extends down some 10-15 meters into the lunar regolith, with the roots coming out of the roof of the human's living caves. Gas exchange of carbon dioxide-> oxygen happens at the roots, and AOX provides heat to the colonists.

3) Humans eat the bark of the air trees for sustenance?

Several problems though:

1) How do the air trees reproduce? The humans can't get near the surface without being sucked into space, yet without the light of the sun no sapling can grow big enough to both have leaves poking through the surface and roots in the human caves.

2) The hydrology cycle is totally wack. Everyone dies of thirst in the first week.

3) Wouldn't the lunar colonists be trapped on the moon forever now? Even if they flourished, and riddled the moon with a maze of tunnels and air trees, how are they ever going to start building rocket ships under these conditions?

*** It's more likely that we'd use bacteria or algae instead of palm trees. In a decade or so when rockets get cheaper we won't need to worry as much about self sustainability.

​

We need to account for ROI, if producing X there costs 10x more than here including shipping, there's no reason to produce it there. Luxuries like that are for much later, when technology is far better and cheaper.

As for 3), lunar surface is very suitable for launch loops/electromagnetic catapults. No atmosphere+small gravity well make that actually feasible, compared to earth. Escape velocity 1.6km/s IIRC, thats achievable with small enough catapult lengths. And catapult can be almost horizontal.

*** The trees aren't going to work. A lunar day lasts about two weeks, and surface temperatures would easily be high enough during the day and low enough at night to kill the trees, even assuming they could survive in a vacuum. You're right to build underground, but the main benefit is the thermal mass of the regolith above you to help maintain stable temperatures.

A lunar colony will need to be industrial. You'll need mining, refining, and construction equipment. Your food can come from hydroponic farms using artificial lighting. For locally-sourced water, your only option is to collect it in tiny quantities from polar craters as ice. You'll want to recycle it religiously, because it's not easy to come by, and only naturally sticks around in areas which are in permanent shade. Aside from water, your other big limiter is carbon. Everything else is fairly abundant - almost all of the rocks are oxides, so you can easily extract oxygen in the course of mining and refining materials to expand your base.

  That's the problem I'm trying to avoid. If a self sustaining lunar colony must be industrial, it places the minimum population size for human self-sufficiency on the order of tens of thousands of people. You'd need metal workers, miners, smelters, mechanics, electricians, glass blowers, computer fabrication, etc. etc.
#+end_quote

You're probably best off choosing a subset of industrial technology rather than avoiding it altogether. You definitely don't need computers. I'd try looking at the minimal way to make a high temperature solar-powered furnace; once you have a good way to melt things you have a lot more options for resources. Anything that makes farming less labor-intensive also has a huge impact, since any time spent farming is time spent not doing things that aren't farming (that's a tautology but this ends up being a useful way to understand what a civilization is capable of).

#+begin_quote

You'll need a way to bootstrap up to a larger population size. Water is the biggest limiting factor so you'll need to settle near a pole and melt that. [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#al02rocket][Aluminum-oxygen rockets]] are apparently a good choice for getting off the moon.

Rocket science isn't /that/ complicated - you just need metal, propellant, and math. If you're just trying to get someone to Earth I don't think it's too outlandish (it's a lot easier than the other way around). If you want to head anywhere else you need to solve a whole lot of engineering problems that haven't been solved yet even using the Earth's resources.

******* You need to get your work area hot enough to melt lunar rock and pull the iron out. That sounds hard to accomplish with mirrors, but there are advantages to trying it on the moon (no atmosphere, so you can make your array as big as you like).

If you can accomplish it with just mirrors made of glass and iron, then it's self-supporting, since those are things you can get by skilled application of digging up rocks and putting them in a furnace.

******** A [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/][rule of thumb]] indicates that we won't be able to get it hotter than about five thousand degrees, but with the right lens arrangement we can probably get pretty close to that limit. I don't know if that's hot enough.

********* Yeah that's plenty. Blast furnaces only go up to 1300 C. There's a question of whether your mirrors are efficient enough though (how much are they reflecting vs absorbing).

Making giant lenses sounds harder than making giant mirrors but I'm not a glass blower.

  Couldn't they just make the tree operate like winter trees on Earth, cutting off its leaves in the cold (or in the extreme hot in this case) and re-connecting them to the trunk when temperatures become more reasonable? The overwhelming majority of the mass of these trees would be buried under dirt, only the tippy tops would stick out.
#+end_quote

In two week cycles with temperatures more extreme than anywhere on Earth, and in a vacuum? No. Even if you could, water losses from the plants via evaporation and sublimation at extreme temperatures would make it completely impractical considering how scarce water is on the moon.

Humanity depends on large societies with specialized labor. I don't think it would require tens of thousands of people though, maybe a hundred or so. Let's make a list. I'll start off with what you've listed, add some more, you can fill in any gaps you can think of, and the next person fills in any gaps they can think of, etc.

- Miners

- Smelting furnace operators

- Industrial maintenance mechanics

- General mechanics

- HVAC mechanics

- Electricians

- Electronics technicians

- Glass blowers

- Semiconductor fabrication technologists

- Metallurgists

- Machinists

- Mold-makers

- Tool-makers

- Die-makers

- Welders

- Pipe fitters

- Plumbers

- Mechanical engineers

- Chemical engineers

- Electrical engineers

- Materials engineers

- Mining engineers

- Engineering technologists

- Engineering technicians

- Construction workers

- Heavy equipment operators

- Automation technicians

- CNC machine tool programmers

- Wastewater treatment plant operators

- Chemical plant operators

- Avionics technicians

- Hydroponic cultivation specialists

That doesn't look terrible so far.

You focused mostly on the first item in this list. I'm focusing more on the last ones.

Even just the significantly easier problem of having a self sufficient colony of people on Earth (who aren't at a primitive technology level) hasn't been solved yet. Just the sub-problem of having a set of tools capable of making "modern civilization" as well as the same set of tools hasn't been solved yet.

Even on earth this is at least 60 things just for the core self sufficient loop, some related tasks (like making buildings), and not-strictly-necessary fundamental tools (like transportation, earth movers, generalized computers, and farming extensions). And that's not including the catalog of every /very useful/ item we use every day, things like washers, dryers, refrigerators, elevators, most infrastructure (road equipment, power substations, telecommunications dishes, pumps). Let alone all the shared parts between them because we want modular maintenance. Let alone all the variants involving different design constraints (local materials, local environmental concerns, specialized tasks, older designs, reusing external parts, etc).

A self sustaining colony would then need to add a bunch of extra things on top of this, the moon would require exotic stuff, stuff that we would almost never need to build on earth, and hence would not be well tested at first, but that's not even the problem. The real problem is that the recovery rate for recycling will need to be much higher without any sort of industrial extraction processes from the Moon (or perhaps asteroids due to the easily escaped gravity well?). So now we need to build exotic stuff with low error tolerances (vacuum seals, cosmic ray resistant computers) and good recovery rates.

I think [[https://www.opensourceecology.org/][open source ecology]] is a project anyone can support in some way that will eventually reach this sub-problem of a related problem. We would need a (probably open source) catalog of items that form cyclic self-sufficient maintenance and manufacturing cycles, including resource extraction and recovery. As well as the catalog of all the stuff one can make with the tools.

The technology simply doesn't exist to manage this even in our most forgiving environment. We don't have a way to track designs, related parts, variants, lifetime maintenance information, let alone do computation over any of this, like planning, scheduling, supply chain management, design changes, regression tests, maintenance alerts, etc. Open source ecology basically just uses a giant wiki, which works well at 60 items, it might even work well for a thousand given enough manpower, but better tools will be the first step towards this.

Self-fertilise, and the seeds are launched explosively (they grow in little sacs which are then pressurised with waste gasses until they explode, scattering the seeds in every direction.

Alternative - The tree sends out runners underground in multiple directions, which then grow into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)][a massive connected network of Tree]].

** I'm reading 80/20 principle, and I have to say it's worth it. I thought I already knew it, and I generally don't value examples that highly, but this book is making me reconsider this.

​

It's been on my reading list for a while, and it's awesome. The amount of optimization and leveraging available to you is so insane and interesting. Such a simple concept I thought I knew plenty about, I was pleasantly mistaken.

I always thought I knew the concept well, now I know I knew it like you know something for a test. And the examples aren't something I hadn't heard either.

It's interesting how you can hear about a concept understand it, and then in the future when you read more it clicks differently and blows your mind.

****** It's not as much as facts, and more of a way of thinking and how to apply it.. Here's an example of how I applied some of it.

I made a list of the games I play frequently, rated them by how much fun they are consistently, added a few addendums, like minimum playtime necessary, can it be played while watching things on my second monitor or podcast listening etc.

Made a simple equation and sorted them based on the ones that give me the most fun per hour and the ones that give me the least.

You know the old 20 of X (in this case of games) give you 80 percent of Z (in this case fun). This made it easier to define which games I should spend more time on, which games I should play less or stop etc..

As you can see this can be applied to anything, even games, and without reading this book and applying it, this concept would have continued to be some exoteric knowledge I have, but don't use for anything other than using it in hindsight to explain things and sound knowledgeable in discussions.
