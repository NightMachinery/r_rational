Because someone usually asks, here's the blurb for anyone who hasn't run into this story yet: "The world has not been kind to Ram's family. Father just lost an arm. Mother can't work. And if Ram can't find a way to make money fast, a life of forced labor is the best any of them can hope for. His only way forward is through the darkest side of their dark world--fighting on the front lines of war against the demons, hiding with thieves and assassins in the shadows, wandering the wilds where the monsters rule.  How much more will the god of the pyre ask him to sacrifice?  And why, Ram wonders, should he be the one to pay?"

As ever, thanks for reading! At this point, I estimate that PB will be roughly 15 chapters (75 installments) in total, which means the final update should go up sometime the middle of next year. But things are somewhat fluid and it wasn't that long ago that I was expecting to have it done in ten chapters.


** Well, now that I'm caught up, I have to say I really like the story.

I wish the introduction phase would end sooner (we /still/ don't know why the hell Ram is so special for the gods and/or the priests to make so much effort to keep him alive), but the overall pacing is pretty good.

The only thing I'd change is the short status updates before every few chapters, eg:

#+begin_quote
  As the note says, I'm trying for every Sunday here. I don't think I could write quickly enough to do biweekly updates for long. I have up through the end of Chapter 2 written, and part of 3.1.
#+end_quote

I'm going to be blunt: nobody cares. By now this is already obsolete.

These notes break the flow of the story, they make you sound way more insecure than the quality of the text warrants, and they don't bring the reader any information about the text.

I'd recommend you remove them, or at least put them at the end of the chapters.

(on the other hand, the sociological excerpts at the beginning of each arc are great!)

*** 1. The chapter "glosses" are a relic from the earliest days of the story, when I hadn't figured out how to hide the archive and needed something to go before the jump so I wouldn't hit new readers with spoilers due to reverse chronological ordering. The archive shouldn't be accessible now, but I kept them up through sheer inertia and to have a place to nag people about TWF voting. I'll give it 24 hours or so for people to reply to this with "stop! I love the inane commentary!" and then go through and gut them.
2. The slow buildup was inevitable for various reasons. I could have cut or compressed parts of Chapter 3, I guess, but that would have removed almost all action from the first third of the book and I liked how they turned out. The rest struck me as dramatically important for either exposition of relevant information or else as part of the long-term plot. However, you have inspired me to move a good part of the big reveal forward to try and break my bad authorial habit of playing cards too close to the chest for too long. That already just about wrecked one book. Thank you.
3. I think the only artist who's allowed to not be insecure about his work is Kanye West.

**** I'd keep maybe one or two notes nagging people about TWF voting, 'cause calls to action are important, but yeah, I think it's better without the blurbs.

You're welcome! I would definitely appreciate the reveal coming sooner. Right now it feels like, whatever the gods want from Ram, would be easier to achieve if he knew what the hell they were doing.

***** Okay, done. I'll just post TWF reminders as comments from now on. AFAICT you folks are doing most of the work keeping me afloat in the rankings anyway.
