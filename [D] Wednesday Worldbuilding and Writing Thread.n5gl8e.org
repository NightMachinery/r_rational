Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** So I've wanted to start writing recently and have some notes on an outline of a setting. I think for now, I would need an idea for a <short story> in this setting.

There are restarts at set intervals (month/season/year?). At each restart everyone gets dropped at a random location with nothing except one chosen item from a previous revision. There is no known goal, just survive. Most people choose to create enough tools and shelter to live a comfortable life but progress no further knowing they will lose it all at the end anyway.

The main character has a plan to eventually break out of the resets by developing more and more complex technology, but something is different this reset: (one of the following)

- Main character has an item he shouldn't have access to.
- Everyone looses everything and no one gets to start with any items leaving many people scrambling to survive.
- Limited number of restarts before x event.
- Restarts beginning to shorten.
- Monsters start to spawn.
- Main character starts with something extra that he didn't choose.
- A person that is unaffected by restarts is discovered.

Keeps one item from each reset

- There are limitations on complexity of the item, i.e. can't bring a smartphone.
- Some people choose to group up and save items that can combine into something greater that gets around the complexity limits.
- Need ideas on /how/ people choose their item. I feel like the "game interface" is a bit overdone.

*** I think it's important to break the loops in a way that fits within some set of established rules, whether that's known to the characters or not. The inciting incident can be the discovery of some new aspect of the rules that no one had known about before, either through direct observation of some natural part of it, or through someone going about something approaching science (or at least iterative testing).

If you want to write a short story though, I think it might be best to focus on what life is like for these people, absent any kind of break from the normal behavior of the resets. Here are some ideas:

- When the loop resets, it brings everyone together ... including outlaws or other people who have been cast out. How the community might handle this is up for debate, but there should be a strong demand for labor right at the start of the loop, as people need to get settled. That gives an opportunity for redemption, so you could tell a small story about that.
- Resets are bound to be a time of hardship, because even nomadic societies have considerably more than a single item. Getting settled would mean finding sources of food, finding water, and finding shelter, all in short order. If weather conditions are good, and the season is right, maybe that's not so much of a problem, but being dropped into the middle of winter with only a single article of clothing, no food stores, etc. might be a death sentence for a small community, and provide a nice backdrop for a survival story.
- Tell a story set in the waning days of a reset, when everyone knows (or 'knows') that it's only a matter of weeks, maybe days, before the next reset, when everything goes away. There are, perhaps, festivals or parties, efforts made to eat through existing stockpiles of food, to slaughter animals, and so on, all in preparation for an upcoming time of hardship. I think that's a somewhat good setting for a coming of age story.

**** Thanks so much, this definitely feels like it will help me drill down to a focused idea for a short story. I especially like the idea of a set of (unknown) rules that are discovered as the story goes along.
