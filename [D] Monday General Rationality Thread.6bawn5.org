** Claim: We need a better vocabulary for "non-standard brain configurations."

I have ADHD.

Imagine wearing an earbud that has a voice reading possibly-relevant Wikipedia articles. This earbud is running all the time. The reader likes to follow random links in the articles.

This is a mixed blessing. Short-run, it makes it astoundingly hard to follow conversations. Long-run, it means that I've been semi-actively reading an encyclopedia since I was 12.

I took abnormal psych classes in college and was impressed by the way they approached mental illness.

Roughly (and from memory):

#+begin_quote
  Mental illnesses are conditions, outside of societal norms, that: cause mental distress for the patient, cause distress for people around them, or make the person unable to fulfill their normal societal roles.
#+end_quote

Effectively, the illness as the cluster-of-symptoms that are causing problems. The doctors aren't trying to "fix" my personality. They're trying to solve the practical problems of "can't focus when I want to," "can't follow a normal conversation," or "fails classes for stupid reasons."

So a "successful treatment for my ADHD" is an unambiguously good thing, and any unwanted changes to my personality become side-effects of medication. This makes it a lot easier for me to recommend that people get treatment for ADHD.

But it means that I don't have a good vocabulary to talk about "positive symptoms" or "neutral symptoms" that are correlated with ADHD. Similarly, I'd like a way to talk about "ADHD-type minds, after the negative symptoms are treated to baseline normal."

I'm aware of "Neurodiversity," but object to the use and philosophy that come with it. In particular:

#+begin_quote
  [Neurodiversity] frames autism, ADHD/ADD, dyslexia, bipolarity and other neurotypes as a natural human variation rather than a pathology or disorder, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) cured, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human diversity, self-expression, and being
#+end_quote

This forces a false dichotomy between "ADHD-neurotypes" and "normal". In reality, I can (and do) look for treatments that remove the constraints like "can't focus when I want to", but leave all of my self-expression intact.

And I'm unhappy with language that tries to re-frame a negative into a positive. It feels like dishonest obfuscation.

*** I have ADHD as well (emphasis on the H, as the therapist who diagnosed me phrased it), and I've also been spending lots of time thinking about how I should relate to it on a personal level. ADHD may technically be a disorder in that I can point to certain aspects of my life that suffer as a result of my ADHD, but I can also point to certain aspects of my life where it has been a boon. At the very least, it was extremely helpful to me academically once I taught myself how to "harness" it.

I have a perfectly valid adderall perscription that I deliberately do not use. I think about my life if I lost all those costs and benefits that come with my ADHD, if I treated myself with adderall, and for some reason it just doesn't appeal to me. Sometimes I wonder if my reasons are bad-- maybe I like my untreated ADHD because it gives me an excuse for whatever shortcomings I have, maybe I like it because it helps me feel different from the crowd, maybe I'm just so used to it that I fear what life might be like without it-- but then I find myself in a situation where my mind is going in several different directions at once, and I can't help but love it.

As a side note, you mentioned looking for treatment that doesn't affect your self expression. One thing that's actually promising is the currently trendy [[https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fidgeteer-Fidget-Spinner-Bearings/dp/B06XVXYC6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494908413&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=fidget+spinner&psc=1][fidget spinner]], which has great utility for people with ADD/ADHD. We have an easier time focusing when we have something else going on in the background. In this case, a simple tactile activity that is repetitive and constantly provides at least a bit of feedback. Even if it's not that product, something like it that you can do absent-mindedly with your non-dominant hand can lead to a marked improvement in focus and retention for people with ADD/ADHD. I have a friend with ADD who started doing much better in high school once his teachers let him knit during lectures. He didn't even have a free hand for notes, but he got much better at absorbing the information. There's a potential avenue, if you haven't explored it.

That was a while ago, however. If you say that adderall has been good for you, I'll take that into consideration and maybe revisit the whole thing. It has been five years since the last time I tried a treatment regimen, so maybe things will be different this time around.

Go to the dentist before you're in excruciating pain. A checkup every 6 months means that you can catch cavities early. And fix then when it's easy.

The same is true about mental health. A 6-month checkup should be normal for healthy people.

Worst case, you spend an hour unburdening yourself on a therapist. Best case, you catch depression early, and can do a mild intervention, without having to go through the years of suicidal ideation.

I drink a cup of coffee on weekday mornings, usually with some milk. On particularly tiring days (or if I had trouble sleeping the night before) I will have another cup in the early afternoon. This happens probably once every couple of weeks. I know some people who don't drink any coffee at all, and some who drink much more than I do.

I think the biggest issue with caffeine consumption is probably the added calories that can come with developing a dependency if you're not doing straight black coffee or unsweetened tea. I personally watch my calories and know what I'm allowed, so don't have problems there, but for a while I was starting to get fat, and part of that was an increase in sugary drinks (all of which had caffeine).

** Weird question I just thought of:

Is the existence of billionaires a net evil? And assuming it isn't, would there probably be a cut-off point, like a trillion dollars or something like that, where we can confidently say no human should wield this much monetary power?

One big problem is that owning a billion dollars almost inherently puts you above the law. That is, if you choose to kill someone or commit some other terrible crime, the lawyers and bribes required to cover it up are likely to be a small fraction of what your fortune earns in annual interest. This suggests that until completely bribe-proof enforcement is possible, permitting large fortunes to exist stands in contradiction to the notion of legal equality for all.

Another problem is that it creates unfair advantage in business and other competitive games, which hurts smaller players (middle class / small business). As a billionaire you have a thousand huge fortunes, which is what a million dollars is to most people. You can in principle make anyone you please immensely rich on a whim. This possibility, while mostly counterfactual, gives leverage over people who hope to be beneficiaries, which you can then use to make yourself even richer. Less wealthy people don't have this kind of leverage, and the poorest end up unable to even borrow from the bank at a tolerable rate (often falling into high interest credit card debt, for example).

Another ethical issue would be the Peter Singer argument, that there are places in the world where life is cheap, such that a single billion could save a million lives. While we are pretty much all somewhat guilty on paper, the drowning child in a pond analogy implies that billionaires are literally /thousands of times/ more guilty of failure to prioritize distant lives than middle class people who make the same mistake. If it is at all right that ordinary folks should feel vaguely guilty they don't do more for children dying of Malaria, logically, billionaires should experience a thousand times the anguish.

So why do we tolerate billionaires?

One possibility is that we have no other choice. They are too powerful to get rid of (by which I mean "tax until they are merely very rich") and are good at resisting attempts to do so. They can hire violent people for protection of their assets, so there might be no way to confiscate them without the prospect of escalating to unacceptable levels of violence.

Another possibility is that very powerful people are frequently a good solution to various hard coordination problems that can't be solved any other way. If these problems went unsolved, perhaps the world would experience significantly more disutility.

We could also consider the possibility that private property is so important and foundational that it outweighs other factors, and that collecting tax is immoral and intolerable from the get go. This may be how some libertarians see the world.

Also perhaps the possibility of becoming a billionaire drives people to perform great acts of goodness that they would not otherwise do. I can't think of a real world example here that doesn't fit under the "accidentally solves coordination problems" heading mentioned above, but perhaps they exist. That the prospect of becoming a billionaire drives some people to great evil is also worth considering, needless to say.

The real answer could be a combination of the above. We may see some motivation to to better individual behavior as the result of aspiring to own billions (although scope blindness probably limits this vs mere millions), some coordination problems that couldn't otherwise be solved (what would be the way to test that?), some moral disutility for the prospect of confiscating wealth above 1000 million, and some inability to accomplish such a thing without an unacceptable cost in violence.

On the other hand, it seems like prohibiting anyone from ever being a /trillionaire/ would be easier because nobody is yet a trillionaire, the prospect of becoming one has never yet motivated anyone to do anything in the real world, and as an unknown phenomenon it doubtless carries economic and existential risks which could motivate such a ban. Billionaires might even support such a ban because their own chance of becoming a trillionaire is slim and they don't want to be lorded over by someone else who gets luckier.

If the question is a round-about way of getting to trans-surgery:

I'm not convinced that there's an "innately male mind" anymore than there's an "innately male height" or "innately male muscle mass."

Sure, some mental configurations / heights / muscle masses are more common among men than women. But outliers exist. Some women are tall. Some women have preferences or muscle mass that's more common among men.

So, the 'standard' progressive trans-position needs to convince me of:

- Gender is "real" outside of social convention
- Other people can sense their own gender
- We should draw boundaries based on internal-sense, not experience or social convention.

But, at that point, surgery wouldn't matter.

**** Ooh! discussion of transness, alright!

First of all, as a trans person, I'm really really confident that transness (I haven't heard of a good noun for "the state of being transgender" so I coined this one. Transgenderism is an alternative) is something which transitioning fixes. I have personally observed the symptoms of gender dysphoria in myself, and transitioning physically and socially has helped with those symptoms. I also know that the overwhelming majority of trans people who transition see similar improvements - moreso the younger they are. So the question of "is it a good thing for people with gender dysphoria to transition?" is settled - yes, it definitely is. Especially when they're young.

But your questions are a little more interesting to me!

#+begin_quote
  Gender is "real" outside of social convention
#+end_quote

Earlier today I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/6baxm8/parents_are_doubtful_keep_giving_me_science_to/dhl7u5f/][this highly informative comment]] on [[/r/asktransgender][r/asktransgender]] which - while sadly sourceless - was a great anecdote of what the commenter learned from a Physical Anthropology course at the University of Colorado about the causes of transness. Again, it unfortunately doesn't cite any sources (besides the commenter's personal experience), but there are some sources in the replies which support it, and it doesn't blatantly contradict any information I can find by googling for a few minutes about pregnancy timelines.

The comment is about a 10 minute read and it presents a pretty convincing explanation of trans identities (including non-binary ones) which, at the very least, isn't /obviously/ false. Check it out.

#+begin_quote
  Other people can sense their own gender
#+end_quote

If you ever have the opportunity, I would suggest that you try presenting as the gender that you aren't - male if you're female, female if you're male. I've spoken with some cisgender men who, for various reasons, presented as and were socially read as female at some point. They described to me a strange sensation of discomfort when they were referred to as female - female pronouns, perhaps a female name they had adopted, etc. Their description of that sensation sounded extremely similar to my own dysphoria!

In other words, you might not be able to "sense" your internal gender until your external presentation doesn't match it. I would poetically liken it to the way that you can't feel the air on your skin unless there's a breeze.

#+begin_quote
  We should draw boundaries based on internal-sense, not experience or social convention.
#+end_quote

Actually, I don't believe in defining boundaries based on any of those. Or rather, I believe that trying to define boundaries carries an extremely high risk of gatekeeping - leaving someone who is trans on the "cisgender" side of the fence, and hence not forbidding them from transitioning. Rather than trying to define such a boundary, I think it best to let anyone transition if they want to. Far more trans people have been prevented from transitioning, than cis people been accidentally allowed to transition - and it seems that the first outcome is worse than the second, since a falsely-transitioned cis person won't be forced to continue living as the wrong gender.

That said, I do approve of RLE (real life experience) requirements for surgery (one year living fulltime as your true gender), and I do believe ASD youths who express a desire to transition should be watched carefully as they start puberty; I have read about cisgender people with ASD who, at some point, expressed such a desire temporarily - I know one such individual personally, actually.

And if one day society is so accepting of trans people that cis people mistakenly transitioning becomes a big problem, we'll fiigure that out then.

#+begin_quote
  But at that point, surgery wouldn't matter.

I don't get what you mean by this? I don't see how those 3 points lead to this conclusion, let alone just the first 2. A mostly [female/male] brain with a [female/male] hormone balance is uncomfortable having [male/female] genetalia, that's my picture of why some trans people want bottom surgery.

***** I think that people, generally, have a 'module' running in our heads that compels us to find tribes, imprint on them, and convey that social identity. We feel dissonance if other people don't recognize us as parts of the tribes that we think are important.

I think we'd both use an explanation like this to explain why people "come out" to their parents as atheists. Or why people would get offended if I repeatedly got their occupation, name or nationality wrong.

My model of transness is that some people's modules imprint on the gender that's maximally inconvenient for their body. An agender person could fail to imprint on either group and feel dissonance when they're described as either male or female.

I think this explains the examples you've raised, without needing any extra notion of a uniquely "male" or uniquely "female" inner life.

We'd expect transitioning to help because it brings someone's public identity in line with their private model of themselves.

I'd feel insecure about switching my gender presentation. But only if I did it in pubic. Trap me on a desert island, and I don't care what I wear.

My initial reaction was the realization that it /would/ be quite uncomfortable, and I thought I might have finally gotten a glimpse of dysphoria...but then you mentioned that getting misgendered was the uncomfortable part for the male friends of yours who had run the experiment. For me, that would be a huge relief. The uncomfortable part would be wondering if I was passing, and having female pronouns directed at me would make me feel a lot /more/ at ease.

***** Interesting! I'm not at all familiar with this stuff (beyond reading a handful of blog posts for social justice-y, don't step on any toes reasons), but since testosterone and brain androgenization are named explicitly, one quick test of the mechanism could be to look at the gender identities of those with androgen insensitivity and XY allosomes, especially since there can be continuous variation in the (in)sensitivity of the androgen receptor... googling around quickly, it sounds like "CAIS girls and women have a female-typical core gender identity, and female-typical gender role behavior in adulthood, usually choose a male partner and do not appear to suffer from gender identity disorder" (and the case study I'm quoting here might be the [[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477513110002020][exception that proves the rule]]).

Hell, I'm sure if this is a contended mechanism people have tested it in some model with sex dimorphism approximating gender identity (e.g. flood an XX mouse embryo with test and see how it behaves as an adult? does it exhibit behavior that looks sort of like induced dysphoria? to what extent can non-human animals even be transgender, and what would it look like?). I'm also not seeing much poking around briefly but it's such a basic and easy experiment that somebody must have done it.

***** WRT biology, I'd unpack the causal chain a bit. The "gender experience is real" model seems to suggest a causality like:

Hormones give a brain a 'masculine' structure. This masculine structure leads to "male" thought patterns. An AFAB kid notices that his thinking has more in common with boys than girls. Based on this, the kid starts hanging out with boys. Eventually, they identify themselves as a boy. Gender expression changes to match.

There are several things that seem odd about this explanation.

The first is that I find myself asking, what, specifically, these "male" thought patterns look like. I'm not really convinced that there's anything going on in my head that we couldn't find in a woman. Perhaps an unusual woman. But a woman.

Then, I'd notice that it's relatively common to find girls who say that they have more in common with guys than other girls. That might make them tomboys. But it doesn't make them trans.

If transness was really just a matter of "masculine" thoughts, then I'd expect transitioning to be much, much more common than it is.

Another oddity is "masculine thoughts," if they exist, should be extremely dependent on culture. A modern american man won't think like a 12 century Chinese farmer, or a 4th century Roman patriarch. So, why don't we see people 'transitioning' across notions of masculinity?

Finally, the "gender experience is real" causality doesn't really line up with self-reports I've read of trans people's experiences.

Brain structures are ancient. If brains are sorting themselves using a rule like "find people who think like me," the relevant inner experiences shouldn't have anything to do with gender expression.

Under this model, people should start changing their gender-expression AFTER they've started to identify with their gender.

But most of the stories I've read from trans people go the other way. People play with gender-expression first. And later they realized that they were trans later.

--------------

I think this all fits better with my model where there isn't any gender-experience, just imprinting. My causality would be something like:

Brains have a notion of 'same' and 'opposite' biological sex. We use this for sexual-imprinting. And for gender-imprinting. The brain's notion of "same" depends on hormones. So, atypical womb environments could cause changes in sexual attraction or gender-identity.

In this case, you don't need to any particular inner experience. The drive is just, "identify and (join/be attracted to) the group with the following secondary sex characteristics ..."

In this model, the changes in brain structure could also cause changes in mental traits. But that would be a side effect.

I'm not sure where you're getting the "male thought patterns" idea from. The first sentence makes sense to me - hormones lead to a masculine/feminine brain structure in an otherwise female/male body (well, female-assigned/male-assigned body, but blehh words). But it's that mismatch between the masc/fem brain and the fem/masc body which causes the dysphoria.

I'm not sure how much of a role social gender roles have on dysphoria. They clearly have /some/ effect, because there are entirely social aspects of gender which have affected my gender dysphoria (or gender euphoria, as the case may be). But it is also clear that social gender roles aren't the ONLY thing causing dysphoria, because many trans people (again, myself included) notice a significant improvement to their mental health after starting hormones, even if they're still in the closet to their friends and family, and even if they are still presenting as their birth gender 100% of the time!

In other words, when a trans person starts taking hormones and changes /nothing else/ about their lifestyle, there still tends to be an improvement. So there may be a social aspect to dysphoria (which would presumably not happen in a genderless society, or on a deserted island), but there is also definitely a biological aspect (which /would/ still presumably happen in a genderless society or deserted island). The strength of each seems to vary from person to person, and I think it's reasonable to guess that cis people who are misgendered experience only social dysphoria; that guess would also explain the feeling you mentioned in your other comment:

#+begin_quote
  I'd feel insecure about switching my gender presentation. But only if I did it in pubic. Trap me on a desert island, and I don't care what I wear.
#+end_quote

Regarding your "imprinting" model, I think I can get behind it as a potential mechanism for how trans people are born only feeling the "internal, brain-body mismatch" kind of dysphoria, internalize social concepts of gender as they grow up, and develop the "social, want to imprint on the wrong gender role and express the wrong gender presentation" kind of dysphoria.

And because I'm a bit paranoid about giving the wrong idea, I do want to again emphasize that regardless of what gender dysphoria is and what causes it, transition and supportive gender-affirming therapy is the only known cure - and a very effective one too.
