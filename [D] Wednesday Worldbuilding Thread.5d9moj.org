Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I asked this on Discord, but here's a revised version of the question:

1. In a world where assassination is legal, or illegal but with poor enforcement and tacit understanding that the police won't look into it too heavily, what spoken and unspoken rules govern assassinations?

2. What do you expect to be true about a world where assassination is de facto legal with codified rules that govern it?

I want something like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_duello][code duello]] for assassination, which probably requires building from both ends; the assassin rules answer half of the problems with the concept, while the worldbuilding answers the other half.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld has an institutionalized assassin's guild /which actually tries to make a bit of sense/ but it's also plastered over with humor. So far as I can see it, the rules there are:

1.  One assassin at a time.
2.  Assassinations are for large sums of money.
3.  No killing people not on contract (except maybe guards).
4.  Assassinations are not public things.
5.  No guns, no poisons.
6.  Assassination ideally takes place in the home or business.
7.  No torture.
8.  No robbery.
9.  Assassins must wear black.
10. Assassins must have style.

But that set of rules is largely playing the concept for laughs, rather than taking it deadly seriously (ha) as something which exists within the world as one of those screwed up things that makes sense for chaotic-agents-working-at-cross-purposes reasons but which doesn't make sense if you were building a society from the ground up. Much like dueling.

Edit: Another real-world example might be honor killings, though I don't really know much about them.

I'm having a hard time imagining any situation where this could occur except in the case of an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism][anarcho-capitalist]] society. It would require a kind of peculiar anarcho-capitalist society where particularly heinous actions like rape and murder are punishable by death, but no centralized legal system exists to arrest, convict, and execute people for doing such things. In lieu of that, private assassins could be hired to carry out death sentences against such people.

The rules would most likely be as follows:

- You must be part of an assassin's guild. If you are not, it is treated as a vigilante killing and you may be justifiably assassinated if you are caught or identified.

- You must be paid. If you are not, it is treated as a vigilante killing.

- You must have no relationship (family or close friendship) with the person who hires you, nor with the person you have been hired to kill. If you are related to the person who hires you, it is treated as a vigilante killing. If you are related to the person you kill, it is treated as unjustifiable assassination and you may be justifiably assassinated if you are caught or identified.

- You must exercise due diligence to verify that your target has indeed committed an action which justifies assassination. If your target did not actually commit any action to justify assassination yet you kill them anyway, then you and your employer both become justifiable targets of assassination.

- You must only kill the target you are hired for. You may incapacitate others who stand in your way, but you can be sued for their injuries. Killing anyone other than your target is treated as vigilante killing.

- You must kill your target in a humane way, offering a quick and close-to-painless death. Families can sue you for causing inhumane deaths.

- You must leave a unique calling card to identify your guild and to anonymously but uniquely identify yourself. This allows anyone you attacked in the process of your assassination to sue you indirectly through your guild. Suits for inhumane death can use the same process. Failure to leave your calling card is treated as a vigilante killing.

That basically gets you an anarcho-capitalist society with a death penalty. Really, really weird.

You might not get a single assassins' *guild* with this (you could, but you don't have to), but this would probably mean the development of, so to speak, assassination firms, with separate arms for investigation and contract fulfillment.

Some firms might center around just one or a handful of assassins, while others might be much bigger.

Except that we have historical things like lynchings, where the act is "illegal" but no one actually gets punished for, investigations mysteriously stall out, or juries find in favor of the defendant despite overwhelming evidence. Or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour_killing_in_Pakistan#Pakistani_law][honor killings in the Middle East]], where:

#+begin_quote
  An Amnesty International report noted "the failure of the authorities to prevent these killings by investigating and punishing the perpetrators." Honour killings are supposed to be prosecuted as ordinary murder, but in practice, police and prosecutors often ignore it.
#+end_quote

Essentially, I'm imagining a world where sure, assassination is "illegal" but so long as a murder is clearly an assassination the investigation will have no time or money put into it, and no one will really expect it to result in consequences for anyone ... so long as it's done in a civilized fashion.

Is there any reason that you can't stitch your rules onto a more traditional pseudo common law system? That is, certain things are still illegal and tried/punished by the state, but other things fall into the realm of this extrajudicial system which the judicial system turns a blind eye to, or which has state approval.

The inside view being something like, "Do you remember the bad old days when assassination was illegal? We still had assassins and killings, but they were far more violent and brutal. Assassins these days are professionals. No one actually wants to go back to people hiring back alley assassins." Or "If you outlaw assassination, only outlaws will hire assassins. You're asking good people to unilaterally give up a method of remediation."

**** For a one-off roleplaying game, I produced a dystopian society in which (among other things) everyone's life had a value based on previous investment and current wages. When people died there was money owed to the various parties who depended upon those individuals' output plus whatever debt they had accrued while educating themselves to the investors who had backed that education.

If that price were paid in advance, and certain legal obstacles were cleared, it was perfectly within the law to have someone killed.

Assassins operated as a side-business of some law offices, navigating the necessary loopholes and paying the necessary beneficiaries as well as carrying out the actual killing in a way that didn't step on any of the wrong persons' toes. So long as they were performing per a contract, they weren't liable for the death at all. It remained a business arrangement between their clients and their targets' assorted bag holders. As such, assassins could be flamboyant public figures rather than skulking in the shadows.

Private police operated in a similar way with regard to incidental deaths, injuries, and property damage.

All law was contract law, and absolutely everything could be settled in cash... or, in this case, the decaying [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld][freigeld]] cryptocurrency that the tiny, bathtub-drowned government maintained via a negligible transaction tax on its secure federal exchanges.

The session focused on investigation and legal wrangling surrounding an assassination firm having killed somebody's decoy duplicate rather than the actual person... essentially a wrongful death suit issued by the decoy's relatives with the help of the decoy's employer: the original target.

**** I don't know if it necessarily has to be anarcho-capitalistic, just effectively anarchic. Imagine a government that lacked the power to enforce its goals, but did keep a stable economy by having a stranglehold (or something similar on industry). This doesn't have to fully manifest itself - it could just be bad enough to warrant an improvised justice system. Remember, hired killers exist in real life too.

***** As one example, look at lynching in America. The federal government didn't find it politically expedient to do much about lynching except in the most egregious cases, and at the state level many prosecutors, sheriffs, etc. were complicit in lynchings.

/Obviously/ lynching someone is illegal, but the lynch mob makes no attempt to hide or mask their violence, going so far as to send out post card commemorating the event and taking out ads in newspapers to announce it, the local and state police don't do anything about it, and the federal government doesn't act unless there are riots or national protests.

*** The trouble with solving all your problems with murder is that if everyone does it, pretty soon most of the population will be dead. This is why dueling has been illegal for so much of history - it only glamorizes daring young men getting themselves pointlessly killed. It may be cool, but if too many people get themselves killed over trivial arguments, there won't be anyone left alive to actually run society.

So one reason assassination might have codified rules and traditions is to ensure that it doesn't happen very often. The victim is told ahead of time who wants them dead, and why, so that they have a chance to make amends and avoid their fate. Or to hire guards, or to bribe the assassin back, or in some other way resolve the situation. Rules of protocol for hiring assassins would delay the process further, ensuring that the would-be client cannot make a spur-of-the-moment decision in the throes of anger. Maybe they're very expensive to ensure that most people simply can't afford to hire an official assassin.

It would be a nuclear option for high-society types against each other, often invoked as a bluff but hardly ever used. One might threaten to assassinate someone simply to ensure that they don't go out in public, so they miss some important social event.

*** Taken from Dragon Age:

It's a game, part of a social dance, and informing someone a contract has been put on their life is mandatory courtesy for any respectable company of assassins.

--------------

While that sounds nice, in a society where assassination is commonplace at all, I can't imagine the most successful assassins needing to conform to rules like courtesy and assassin's codes. They'd be too stealthy, too competent to need to bother.

I can see a secret language of symbols, though, meaning a certain target is off limits. Whether it's because that person is a fellow assassin or another reason no one would know, hence the identity-obfuscating purpose behind the symbols. If anyone were to kill an off-limits target, all cooperating assassins agree to kill the defector in order to return to their Nash equilibrium. Few assassins will want the worry that comes with a constant risk of being assassinated.

I can see some assassins would want to hunt other assassins for sport - not sure what other rules would evolve from that threat.

*** The Vlad taltos novels have something like this. [[http://dragaera.wikia.com/wiki/Jhereg]]

It's fairly different in that theres the ability to resurrect someone if the body isn't to damaged and they haven't been killed with a weapon meant to prevent this. You end up with normal assassination being a sort of statement telling people to back off. The person assassinated wakes up a bit latter and someone had to pay quite a bit for the resurrection.

I also read a story recently where the government of a system was only in place so that it could fill what was mandated by a greater charter. As such they had no active police force and instead had bounties issued by the government. As there was no sanctioned police force resisting capture was perfectly legal. Killing a bounty hunter would meant that future ones would bring lethal force to bear immediately though and that your bounty could increase.

*** In C.J. Cherryh's Chanur series, one of the alien species (the Kif) have a society in which assassination is not merely legal, but an accepted part of said society. (In fact, not much is illegal in Kifish society - the law basically comes down to "Do Not Make The Hakkikt* Angry").

Some consequences of this include:

- All Kif are armed. All the time. Guns and knives.
- All Kif dress exactly the same way (long, hooded black cloaks). Anyone going after an individual Kif needs to first figure out which of the hundreds of cloak-wearing shapes is the one he is after.
- Attempting to kill a Kif will result in him defending himself (and it's not illegal for /him/ to kill, either).
- In Kifish society, "do this or I'll kill you" is not exaggeration; it is understood to mean the same as "you have a choice; complete this task or try to kill me first"
- If you value your life, you do not sneak up on a Kif.

From the point of view of other races, the Kif are commonly derided as bandits and pirates, and not without reason. They do not find employment on other races' ships, other races tend to give Kifish bars a wide berth, and it takes a certain amount of courage or stupidity to try to trade at a Kifish spaceport unless you know exactly what you're doing.

(Their society's really quite fascinating. It's pretty much a deconstruction of the Always Chaotic Evil trope)

*Hakkikt: - This word is probably best translated as "Prince" or "Leader". One can become the Hakkikt by killing the previous Hakkikt and then surviving.

** Off topic: is there a Tuesday thread that didn't get posted? Or am I just imagining something?

What is the perfect amount of grimdark for world building? I mean, obviously, it depends on people's taste, but there has to be a pretty stable equilibrium. Shows like /Game of Thrones/ seem to be reasonably popular, but other gritty things seem to scare a small part of the market away.

Do you think rationalizing (rationalifying? sensibiliting?) a setting makes grimdark more tolerable? (ie. Worm, HPMOR) Or does it make the grimdark less tolerable, because it presents a paradigm where the only logical conclusion is saddening?

***** The joy there is vicarious triumph over impossible challenges.

No joy might be the reduction of an urchin or king to motes of dust or broken rubble over the course of 150,000 humorless words, followed by their death and a switch to a new protagonist halfway through the novel. Or perhaps the urchin or king rises again to greater heights over the next 150,000 words. Either way few readers will trudge through those first 150,000 thousand.

I don't think anyone wants to read a joyless novel unless it's a clearly structured exploration of a foreign mindset.

***** I think it depends on how audience members define a victory. I suffered from Darkness Induced Audience Apathy while reading Worm because I only saw Taylor as surviving rather than succeeding. Even if she kept defeating her adversaries, the situation she was in only seemed to get worse with little hope of reprieve.

It started to hit me after Leviathan and I finally stopped reading after Jack Slash and Bonesaw apparently escaped the city. That, on top of the death and destruction that had been caused and the clearly malicious conspiracy among the Protectorate, was just too much for me.
