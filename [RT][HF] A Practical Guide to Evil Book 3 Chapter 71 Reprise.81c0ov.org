** /You know, Cat, this whole "worrying about your humanity" thing is only going to go so far.../

She's in the Ship of Theseus situation. Plank by plank, various parts of her have been 'replaced', and it's arguable if its possible for her to "lose" her humanity at this point, as objectively there's very little left.

VERY little indeed. As the comments on EE's site point out, she's turning into some sort of AI. Like the Queen of Summer, she has directives that she must obey and which grant her power.

#+begin_quote
  My beliefs would just become duties enshrined in ice, as binding and unmoving as those that had doomed the Queen of Summer. I could be fluid and powerless, or unbending and powerful.
#+end_quote

You can see that in her interaction with Kegan. She has to remind herself that the Duchess is Callowan and that's the only thing that stops her from bullying her into submission. It's likely that her first duty is some variation of "protect the Callowan people".

**** That's curious. What defines an AI from a... NI? (Natural Intelligence?)

I mean, lets take this in a more rational sci-fi direction.

Someone invents nanites that can rebuild cells as nanotech devices instead of individual biological units. But each /nanocell/ can still perform the original functions of the organic cell (/nanomuscles/ work as well as muscle cells, /nanoneurons/ the same as nerve cells, etc), including communicate flawlessly in the exact same manner with the un-converted biological cells (we will assume it has special I/O ports for both biological and artificial cell interaction, the latter being much faster).

The /nanocells/ begin replacing the character's brain, cell by cell. All the chemical and electrical interactions remain, so the same 'thoughts' occur and the person subjectively notices no difference (the 'faster' I/O ports on the /nanoneurons/ are programmed not to activate until the entire system is replaced to prevent processing speed discrepancies). The process is designed to be painless, and doesn't happen instantly, instead taking months or even a year to finalize.

At which point is the person no longer "human"? At which point do they qualify as an AI rather than a NI?

*** Yeah. I'm kind of worried that, since the Aspects are mostly extensions of the tendencies already present in their Named, cutting out Seek reduced Catherine's ability to plan to mostly the Foundling gambit and doubling down (unless there's a story to follow. Another weakness in the struggle against the Bard).

  “Do you play shatranj, Duchess?” I asked, voice echoing strangely.

  This I time I knew why she shivered.

  “I do,” she said.

  “To have a game , you see, you need an unspoken assumption,” I murmured. “That all the pieces will obey.”
#+end_quote

Uh oh. Calling it now, Cat is going to turn into a giant snake and eat all the players. She's even cold blooded already!

In all seriousness, it's nice to see Cat move outside of Black's and Malicia's sphere of influence. I'm a bit weary of what she's planning - she says she's not going to rebel - but then, what are you going to do? It would make the most sense for all of the baddies to deal with the existential threat that is the crusade and hash out the details of who rules what afterwards but it seems like Cat has other plans, maybe a coup?

What I find most surprising is Malicia's silence. I would expect her to try and secure Cat's allegiance as soon as possible. Despite not having the Name, she is essentially acting as the Black Knight: dealing with the legions, preparing for war and setting strategy. Especially now, that Black has betrayed her, she should try to secure Cat's support in any way possible simply to have more firepower.

*** Cats internal monologues and even a lot of the comments in these r/r chapter threads have spoken about Cat becoming more Evil and more comparable to your typical villain. I have never seen it - she's had good reasons for all her previous actions in my opinion. THIS though, this was the first time I stopped and thought ‘shit that's cold' (excuse the pun) and I actually felt that Cat finally was taking a turn towards Evil.

***** Its also interesting that she's agonizing about keeping her goodness and humanity a lot in how she behaves with people face to face, but is much more willing to do casually evil things to people she doesn't know directly. (A bit like a inverse of the Singer drowning child scenario. )

Its like shes trying to monitor herself for doing evil things, but doesn't always notice. Which maybe shows the limits of trying consciously to be 'good' but without feeling it at a deep level anymore. I get the sense she wouldn't feel directly bad about hurting people anymore, she just remembers her own rules of conduct from before which restrain her.

** I'm actually surprised Masego hasn't suggested experimenting with how Catherine reacts to magic. Inform her beforehand, then try to make her go through several types of wards one geared towards humans, one towards fae, the third towards both and the final one being aimed at beings outside creation.

Along with that, attempting to bind Cat (With her prior approval of course) would probably save them a nasty surprise down the road if it turns out that she can be bound like a regular fae. Finally, an experiment to see if she's affected by banishings should be in order, though care should be taken as they have no idea how she”d react.

** Guys... I think I know what name Cat is going to get. First, some facts we know:

- She destroys everything she touches ("a woe upon all...");
- She followed a cold-blooded murderer with a shtick (Black);
- She is a Cat.

There's only one [[http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Killer_Queen][Queen]] with those traits, isn't there?.

For example,「Dread Crown」is a short-range stand that also allows for some generation of ice, typically in its immediate vicinity. While still invisible to non-Stand users, it can raise fresh and increasingly intelligent corpses.
