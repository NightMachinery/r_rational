** What's this? Could Ana finally be on the road to realizing that Commonplace cares about people like her more than Paragon does? We can only hope.

*** I hope so. It also looks like she'll be pretending to be a humdrum, so it will be interesting to see what happens when she meets the leader of Commonplace---if Ana projects, Lorne and Paragon would be on them in minutes. Hopefully she realizes that her goals align with Commonplace's, and soon

**** I don't think she'll be pretending to be a humdrum, considering she identified herself to them as the Blue Charlatan. Besides, if she was pretending to be a humdrum, I don't think she'd get the meeting she's after. The mysterious leader of Commonplace would have no reason to meet with her if she wasn't a successful mercenary projector who'd just been burned by her former employers.

***** Oh I agree, I was really wondering whether she will out herself to all the members of Commonplace, or if she will join them and pretend for their members to be a humdrum

****** I don't think she's going to keep her current body. It's about to die.

They'll probably ship her on a boat outside Lorne's range and do the swap there.

Though I guess she could pretend to be a humdrum then? It's not like she can use her powers as long as Lorne is active.

*** I kind of want to point out that Commonplace are terrorists, and have all the monstrous behaviors associated with the word (working with drug dealers, murdering the population they're claiming to protect to generate outrage, taking orders from a foreign country with imperialistic motives, spending the lives of their lower-ranked minions like candies, etc).

** Not a bad chapter, but definitely not my favorite chapter either. Some remarks:

- It feels kind of contrived that Lorne had the foresight and the time to put a tracker while he was choking Ana, but he couldn't simply stab her in the throat while he was at it. Like, okay, maybe he was really confident he'd kill her and so he took he time because he's sadistic. But then why bother with a tracker?

- The pace feels all over the place. This arc has two chapters and a half covering a period of 20 minutes, then half a chapter covering several weeks of time, and there's not much transition.

- On the second reading, I kind of get the point about ambition being like a high and that Ana is going through withdrawal, but on the first reading I was just kind of surprised how defeatist Ana was, considering she got out of tougher jams that this one. It felt like the group was completely resigned to their new status, even though they had a lot of possible solutions (eg going to a different city and stealing a body there, so that by the time Lorne catches up the tracker ping has expired).

I think maybe the second half would have been better served by playing on the format more. For instance Twilight did something kinda cool in the 2nd book, to communicate that the protagonist is depressed: it has 5-6 empty chapters in a row, representing the months that go by as Bella kind of goes through the motions and doesn't engage with the world around her.
