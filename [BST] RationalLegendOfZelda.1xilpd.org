You guys seemed to like my concept for [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1w14i4/bstspoilers_rationalfrozen/][Rational!Frozen]], and while I was working on another game design (chosen hobby, probable career) I got a jolt of inspiration which snowballed into this. Enjoy.

--------------

Now /this/ might be a challenge. The /Legend of Zelda/ series (henceforth "LoZ") is pretty far off the deep end as far as lacking rational thought processes in its construction. Then again, so was /Harry Potter/, and we all know how that turned out...

LoZ is a video game. It has always been renowned for its /gameplay/, specifically its level design, and not for having an amazing world or compelling characters. The story is functional at best and cliché garbage at worst, which is all too often. It's a long-running series that reinvents itself every iteration with a loose timeline cobbled together with magic and time-travel.

It's one of my favorite series ever, but man is there some work to do to bring it up to code.

For consistency's sake, I will use [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3h2_oYl76M&feature=em-share_video_user][/The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess/]] as a reference point.

(No, I didn't misspell /Ocarina of Time/. Quit whining. I played both and I still liked TP better, so there. And any rational!fic is going to have plenty of points of divergence.)

For or those two people who don't know what LoZ is all about, I'll summarize: it's a game series where you play as Link, the prophesied hero and bearer of the Triforce of Courage who will defeat the evil Ganon, bearer of the Triforce of Power, thereby saving Princess Zelda, bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom and the rest of the kingdom of Hyrule. Along the way of this epic quest you will meet and help a variety of side characters and collect an arsenal of tools and devices, including the Master Sword, The Blade of Evil's Bane.

How do we rationalize that? It's pulp fantasy, through and through.

For everyone wondering about rationalizing these sorts of irrational stories, I have some advice. I've been doing a lot of thinking on this topic, and there seem to be two approaches:

- Take everything about the story and deconstruct it, rebuilding a carefully designed narrative. LoZ doesn't really have enough meat to sustain a story like that for very long.

- Take /one thing/ about the story and exploit it to the fullest, usually what the story did best. For LoZ, these are its Dungeons.

And so, *I propose the rationalization of the Legend of Zelda series by means of making Link an architect.* The fic will take a rationalist slant to architecture, engineering, level design, and puzzle design/solving.

#+begin_quote
  /Link worked all the way from a farming village on the outskirts of Hyrule to the prestigious Academy of Magic/ (better name pending)/, where he will train to be a mage. However, he flunks the magic exam entirely, not only wrecking his career but humiliating himself in front of the young Princess Zelda, who passed immediately afterward with flying colors. Link begrudgingly picks up his old hobby of studying architecture and engineering while trying to crack the secret of what makes her so much more powerful. Things destabilize when Link is implicated in a violent sabotage of the school's magic program which critically injures the princess, quickly turning Link's "investigation" into an epic quest which entangling the lives of a few more friends and enemies, etc./
#+end_quote

I don't know what the actual plot would be like, but hopefully I could make it a little more interesting than the "Forest, Fire, Water, Master Sword, PostMSDungeon/1/, PostMSDungeon/2/, ... PostMSDungeon/N/" that the games do. Maybe Rational!Link would acquire the Master Sword earlier than usual in the story, or perhaps later.

A more pressing concern is how to keep Link as a one-man army, and if not, how to handle having squads of side characters. In many LoZ games the central government of Hyrule is usually the first to go, with the King alternately dying/cursed at the very start of the game. Often, Ganon's objective is to first assemble the Triforce and then utterly conquer the world.

Some other parts of the story would have to deal with game-y aspects of the source fiction, like why keys only work once, or how underground complexes support complex food chains of monstrous creatures and demi-humans, and the methodologies of creating temples which are inaccessible to armies but enable a solitary hero of specific qualities to gain their secrets. Another focus would be on the special items/tools found within dungeons, and novel ways of combining them to solve impossible tasks. The ultimate goal of the story would be to break the eternal cycle of conflict, but I'm not sure what form that would take.

I'm at a loss for the companion character. Rational!Link is more self-sufficient than other incarnations, so creating a good foil which is not made immediately redundant or relagated to a search engine would be somewhat tricky. Also, does anyone have a good idea for a title?

Edit^{1} : missed a period.

Edit^{2} : *Here's the most important question: what "game mechanic" would be best suited to forwarding the rationalist theme of the story?*


** I like the concept and appreciate the insight in your planning/creative process, but... trying to attend a magic academy? I know ration!lovedStoryFromChildhood usually diverges pretty fast, but they usually start similarly. If your using Twilight Princes as your reference, then why not have Link start off living in a ranching town out in the boonies. He could be studying with an old architect who decided he wanted to retire away from the busy city. Then he can be thrown in to the adventure in typical LoZ fashion and rationalize his way from there. I feel he needs to start in the same place he would in any other LoZ game.

As far as companion characters, TP comes with one. And if your not looking to follow any game to closely, between Minda and Navi we get a model for how to design a LoZ style companion (twist, Links not the rationalist, it's Navi (oh please no)). Someone small that and follow him around easily would be a good someone to have for Link to explain things to or bounce ideas off of. Fairies are used many times in the games. See [[http://zeldawiki.org/Link's_Partners]] and [[http://zeldawiki.org/Fairy_Companion]]

As you pointed out, Link tends to spend most of his stories alone in dungeons, so how you handle that is something I am interested in.

*** Over three upvotes in less than half an hour? I sense lurkers.

You make a good point with the opening. The magic academy was more of an excuse to get over the initial worldbuilding hump; little if any of the story would take place there past the first chapter or two.

I don't think I'd directly make it an actual Twilight Princess fanfic. Everything would, more-or-less, have to be original content.

Unless...

Maybe the fic could, true to the series, introduce a new magic mechanic along with the new plot. Something to quickly travel between existing dungeons, and their continuities? A planeswalking Link could turn very interesting indeed.

** It could work. I personally prefer less radical departures from canon - perhaps just giving Link the Triforce of Wisdom.

At any rate, you need a plot, rather than just ideas - a conflict and its resolution. Breaking the eternal cycle of history is a good plot, and there are lots of "rationalist" places that you can take that; kickstarting an industrial revolution, preventing the stagnation and decline of civilization, setting up things so that the next iteration of yourself has a better chance than you did, going to space and escaping the bounds of the repetitious earth, etc.

I'd personally like /Ocarina of Time/ or /Majora's Mask/ better as a base, but maybe that's only because I'm a sucker for time travel.

Alternately, you can make over the whole dungeon structure so that each is a puzzle all its own that's more complicated than the ones in the game (which largely come down to simple cause and effect with some physics thrown in). Make each be an intellectual parable - the dungeon of philosophical zombies, the dungeon of the Ship of Theseus, the dungeon of extra dimensions, the dungeon of reversed cause and effect, etc. I think I'd like that, just in order to get the same sense of exploration that the original games have.

Maybe start the story out with Link building a dungeon for Ganondorf and/or the king? The inciting event of the story would be when someone tries to use the Triforce, and it splits into its pieces, one of which finds its way to Link and makes him a nice and juicy target.

Alright, those are all my disorganized thoughts on the matter.

*** The concept of just "giving" Link the ToW to make him rational doesn't sit well with me.

I do like your idea for theming the dungeons a lot, though. That has limitless potential.

As for starting with designing a dungeon, that could work. The fly is that the dungeons on the LoZ universe have been consistently /very, very old/. But putting an in-progress structure under a Cursed Zone (pun intended) might be enough.

** Neat! The idea of a rational!LoZ is one of the things that inspired my current video game project.

I agree that there's so much that's just utterly broken about LoZ:

- The repeating Zelda/Link/Ganon cycle makes no sense. It stinks of predestination and prophecy, two things that should have no place in any rational universe or well-written fiction. (Caveats apply.)
- Why does Link alone fight? There are many people in Hyrule, so why is he the only one to resist? He's just a farm boy, right? What's his motivation?
- Where do the hearts you find in bushes come from? Or the rupees that monsters drop? What effect would all those rupees have on the Hyrule economy?
- Why does Ganon want power so badly? Well-written villains (and presumably their IRL counterparts) never see themselves as evil, so what greater good does Ganon think he can achieve?

I'm not a fantastic writer, or rationalist for that matter, but I'm trying to make the story for my game as rational as I can. Feel free to use these ideas below. Having a fanfic of my game, or even just inspiring some aspects of your fic, would let me cross something off my bucket list! ^_^

- There are prophecies but they're all false. The Chosen One / Hero character Lance dies in his first fight.
- Lenna, the protagonist, is a teacher of math and logic. After the kidnapping of her pupils, she seeks out the 'archangel' monster responsible for it. That is the basis of both (a) an explanation of why she might be uniquely well-placed to be rational; and (b) the motivation for her actions in the story.
- I have no explanation for the hearts or coins. But related to the currency issue, the economy is going through some hard times. After the appearance of the archangels people are staying inside rather than going out killing monsters and the banks can't rely on new deposits to pay off their debts.
- There are a few villains in my story; all have good motives. The chairman of the bankers' guild is one. He hatches a plan to save the economy, but by using an ancient high-tech device to manufacture an army of monsters to force the townsfolk to fight and collect more coins. [[#s][The kidnapper archangel is another:]]

There's more about /Lenna's Inception/ [[http://bytten.net/devlog/lennas-inception/][on my website]]. It's playable most of the way through at the moment, albeit without ending, story or external locations yet. But you can at least use keys multiple times. ;)

Back on the topic of rational!LoZ, I think your fic would work well as a "what if": what if Link got the Triforce of Wisdom instead of courage, and that is what made him rational?

*** I personally dislike just giving Link the Triforce of Wisdom for a couple of reasons. First, Zelda has had it every time; why has she never managed to do something significant with it? In every single game she's a plot-damsel, practically a non-entity.

Second, I think it's poor taste to say the "Triforce of Wisdom makes you rational" because... well, the Triforce was always distributed by the gods along bloodlines, right? That's a double cliché of determinism, and /just giving/ Link his rationality is not something I want to do.

Alternately, the Triforce of Wisdom doesn't make you rational, it comes to you /because you're rational/. Link gets the Triforce of Courage because he's courageous, right?

***** Zelda-as-Sheik only happened once. Her angency fluctuates wildly, but always goes deep in the depths of damselation.

Link doesn't get it because he's courageous. Link has always had the ToC because he was the last descendant of the bloodline of Ancient Hylian Knights. He holds it since birth, with no one act of courage promting it manifestation until Ganon starts using his. Link does get the Master Sword because he's courageous, but I don't know how much of this "worthy hero" nonsense comes from him or from the ToC (which is certainly another thing to explore).

The other reason I don't want to give the ToW to the story's rationalist is because of the exponential intelligence growth. Use the device which makes you smarter to make you even smarter, repeat until god. I don't want to make Link Contessa Ganondorf.

** Rational!Zelda doesn't need much change to the core story structure. Even though sealing things behind plot trinkets is cartoony, it's a great idea if that's what your magic system allows. Ganon generally achieves his aims efficiently, by applying a small amount of sorcery through political channels (in LttP he does this especially well) and Link's strategy of gathering artifacts while hunting down the trinkets sounds completely reasonable given the problems he faces.

The only folly here is that Ganon sits on his thumbs for the meat of the plot: a rational Ganon would be proactive about shoring up his defenses and attempting to intercept Link. A more intelligent Link would be able to handle this. There is room to portray a game of cat and mouse here, which gives you new narrative opportunities while still hitting the same major plot points.

OT's theme of time travel has lots of room for a rational look, although you might want to replace the core time loop with something that makes actual sense. LttP's Dark World's theme of showing people as they are on the inside could be made into a theme of the Dark World bringing out the flaws in your personal utility function.

But the best rationalist Zelda is of course Link's Awakening, as exploring the nature of rationality, the mind, and perception from within what is eventually acknowledged to be a dream screams of possibility.

One thing that occurred to me as a natural point of departure: Start with Ocarina of Time, and have everything be the same up to the Temple of Time (including irrational!Link). For a reason to be determined, Ganondorf keeps the Triforce of Wisdom, and here that actually means something: He gets much smarter. Instead of putting Link to sleep for seven years until he becomes an adult, the Sages wake up Fi and have her teach Link x-rationality. After seven years, he is old enough to take up the sword directly; open curtain.

I started writing some fanfiction about someone from our modern world thrust into the game as "Link". Since the original game allowed you to choose your own name, after I started writing with a character named Link, I changed it to Bart because that's the name I usually put in when I was asked to choose a name.
