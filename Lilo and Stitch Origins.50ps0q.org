This is a rational Lilo and Stitch story that I started writing. I have no idea if I'll take it any further than this any time soon, and I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with it. If anyone wants to use this as a writing prompt and make their own story out of it, feel free! Enjoy and let me know what you think!

--------------

The following is translated from Galactic Standard into Human English.

*Galactic Federation Headquarters, Planet Turo*

The Empress stared down at the accused, her expression stern and forboding.

“Read the charges.”

The whale-like Captain Gantu read off the charges. “Doctor Jumba Dukiba, chief scientist of the Galaxy Defense Initiative. You stand before this council accused of reckless and unauthorized genetic experimentation.”

“How do you plead?” queried the Empress.

“Not guilty,” said the accused, Dr. Dukiba. “My experiments so far have been only theoretical, and completely within legal boundaries.”

The Empress frowned. “We have reason to believe you actually created something.”

“Created something?” said Jumba, trying to feign shock and incredulity. “Hah! That would be irresponsible and unethical. I would never ever---“

The specimen was lowered into the council chamber within a transparent container made of something much stronger than glass.

“Make, more than just one,” said Jumba, in a small voice.

The members of the council stared at the little monster in horror.

“...What is that monstrosity?” asked the captain.

“Monstrosity!?” exclaimed Dr. Dukiba, astonished at Captain Gantu's complete incomprehension of the specimen. He steeled himself. This was not the time to get nervous or defensive. As far as he could tell he had done the right thing in service of the Empire. Although the fact that he was now being court martialed suggested that it might also have been a set up.

“What you see before you is the first of a new intelligent species---specimen 626. He is bullet proof, fireproof, can see in the dark, and when he's fully grown he can move objects 3000 times his size and think as fast as a supercomputer. His primary biological drives are to fight, eat, sleep, reproduce, learn, and X.”

“X?”

“X is a variable drive which depends on the specimen's own formative experiences. In particular, It depends on what approach to the prisoner's dilemma works best for him. His mind is not purely consequentialist, there are also reinforcement learning mechanisms programmed into his brain. However, those can be temporarily disabled if necessary for him to accomplish an important task where emotions would distract him too much.”

“I see. So you're saying that depending on how we interact with him, he may grow into a living superweapon that can love, or a living superweapon that can't love. Both outcomes are unacceptable. Either it would be a disaster somewhat under our control, or a disaster under no one's control. Even if it sided with the Empire against the rebels, to create a sapient being for the purpose of war is a reprehensible crime.”

Dr. Dukiba kept his eyes on the Empress, questioning, but not challenging.

“If he becomes capable of love and compassion, then logically he would want to use his powers to their fullest to help improve quality of life and survival for all of our kind. That would imply that he would try to end this war as quickly as possible in the Empire's favor. And if he doesn't, then it will be our fault for not treating him right. I believe that our situation as of late is dire enough for drastic measures. As we all are well aware, the rebels have also been conducting such dangerous genetic experiments. This may be our only chance to stop them.”

“That is not your place to decide,” said the Empress. She glanced at Captain Gantu, a suspicious look on her face, before turning back to Dr. Dukiba. “I also find it hard to believe that you would have been able to think of all of the civil and tactical risks of this experiment on your own. You are a scientist, not a general. Did someone put you up to this?”

Dr. Dukiba knew he couldn't lie to the Empress, especially when he was being court martialed. However, he technically didn't need to lie.

“I received this assignment from Special Agent Pleakley, your excellency. He told me that it was classified, and that the order originally came from you.”

Although as soon as he had found out that he was being court martialed, he had realized that this wasn't the case.

“I gave no such order,” said the Empress flatly. “Very well. Dr. Jumba Dukiba, you will continue to be detained while we question Commander Pleakly. This court is adjourned.”

--------------

“Stop! Stop. Lilo, why are you all wet?”

“It's sandwich day.” Lilo sighed. “Every Thursday I give Pudge the fish a peanut butter sandwich.”

“Pudge is a fish...?”

“And today we were out of peanut butter! So I asked my sister what to give him and she said a tuna sandwich! I can't give Pudge tuna! /Do you know what tuna is?/”

“Fish?”

“It's FISH! IF I gave Pudge Tuna, I'd be an abomination! I'm late because I had to go to the store and get peanut butter because all we had is STINKING TUNA!”

“Lilo, why is this so important?”

“Pudge controls the weather.”

There was an awkward pause.

“You're crazy,” said one of the other girls, Mildred.

Lilo tackled Mildred and hit her, then bit her as she was dragged off of her. The other girls screamed and ran around to behind the dancing instructor.

“Please. Please! Everybody calm down!” he put Lilo down. “Lilo...”

“I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I won't do it again!”

“Maybe we should call your sister...”

“No! I'll be good,” Lilo protested. And then in a whining voice. “I just wanna dance. I practiced. I just wanna dance. I practiced.”

“Eeew, she bit me.”

Later...

“I called your sister. She said to wait for you here on the porch. We'll try again on Sunday.”

--------------

Lilo saw the other girls from her hula club talking and laughing together as they left. They were having fun, and being nice to each other. Without her. She felt a stab of loneliness. What happened? What was going on?

“Does this look infected to you?” asked Mildred.

“Yeah," said one of the other girls.

Lilo approached them, trying to keep a smile on her face. When she was right behind them the other girls gasped and turned around, then backed away slowly. Mildred, the bravest of the four girls, said in as menacing a voice as a well-adjusted six-year-old girl could manage, “You'd better not have rabies.”

Another one of the girls spoke up then, her voice barely trembling. “If you have rabies, the dog catcher is gonna have to cut you d-“

Lilo had noticed that the other girls were holding dolls in their hands, and didn't notice what they were actually saying, nor the scared expressions on their faces.

“Are you gonna play dolls?” asked Lilo, excitedly.

The other girls hid their dolls behind their backs, as if to protect them from Lilo.

“You don't have a doll,” said Mildred, nastily.

Lilo pulled an absolutely ugly doll out of her bag. The other girls gasped and backed away even more.

“This is Scrub. I made her, but her head is too big. So I pretended that she had bugs lay eggs in her ears, and she's upset because she only has a few more days to...”

The other girls had already gone.

Let's pause for a second. I know you're probably thinking that there's something very wrong with Lilo. You probably think she's got a mild case of psychopathy. She assaulted another child when they dared to insult her, but then she turned around and was all cute in her apology. Then she seemed to sneak up on the other girls, like some sort of predator, and the doll she showed them was ugly and kind of creepy looking. And the imaginary story she made up about her doll was quite morbid.

But don't be so sure of your conclusions. Things are not always as they seem. There is another explanation for what's going on here.

Months previously, Mildred had jokingly suggested to Lilo that Pudge controls the weather, after Lilo had complained about the awful weather the first two times she'd gone to feed Pudge. Mildred probably hadn't expected Lilo to take her seriously.

Now, Lilo had just attacked Mildred earlier not only because Mildred called her crazy, but also because she (from Lilo's point of view) had lied to her about Pudge controlling the weather. She thought friends don't lie to each other, and she had been going out to feed Pudge every Thursday for the past several months. And Lilo had some anger management problems stemming from the helplessness she felt when her parents died. A few years previously her mother had died from brain cancer, and her father had gotten into a car accident while drunk shortly afterwards. You can probably guess what Scrub's imagined backstory symbolized to Lilo.

Also, Lilo was very oblivious and socially inept, which was why she didn't realize that she was invading the other girls' personal space, nor why she didn't think to apologize to Mildred and the other girls and not just the dance instructor. To Lilo, she had done something bad and then apologized for it, and she didn't understand that the situation called for a slightly more complex resolution than that.

Lilo threw her doll onto the ground in disgust and stomped away. But then, she went back for the doll, scooped it up in her arms and hugged it to her chest. Even though it was just a doll, it was her only friend in the world, besides Nani. And Nani was her sister and a lot older than her, so she didn't count.

Lilo walked back home, alone.


** I'm not sure where this diverges from canon except for the vocabulary.

I only have a vague recollection of these scenes, but it seems to be otherwise nearly verbatim from the source.

The interesting part of this sort of story would be the different responses later on. Would the galactic federation responsible for 626 be more competent in containing him? Would he escape more easily from animal control (given they are likely not as competent as the Galactic Federation he just escaped from), or would the animal control officer identify him as not a dog? Would this superweapon be content to basically be a pet?

*** there's more background info that wasn't in the original, such as the war going on. also dr dukiba is no longer an evil genius strawman like he was in the original. the grand councilwoman was basically an empress so i retconned her title to be empress since that's basically what she was and everybody probably knew that. pleakly is more competent now and he's more important to the story. Lilo now has a social developmental disability, which was kinda sorta hinted at in the beginning of the original movie but was never really clear. also, i'm thinking earth would be much more significant in this story than merely a backwater wildlife preserve that no one cares about, and its significance might have something to do with the war...

in the original pleakly didn't meet dr dukiba until after the scientist was arrested and pleakly was assigned to keep watch over him. in my version they already had met, since pleakly is the one who gave dr. dukiba that research assignment. (although dukiba might have done it anyway even if it wasn't assigned to him, if he really thought it was a good idea.) and i had pleakly promoted to a special forces commander of sorts, rather than just a special agent. a mere special agent probably wouldn't have the clearance to speak to the empress of the galactic federation after all.

also, by making it more clear that Lilo is socially impaired, i managed to actually explain why lilo acted the way she did at the beginning of the movie in a way that made sense, rather than leaving it at "she's crazy and poorly behaved but has a good heart deep down."

also i changed stitch's nature a bit to make more sense. in the original movie dr dukiba said his only instinct is to "destroy everything he touches" (presumably other than himself). if that was his only instinct, i highly doubt he would really be able to learn to care for others. the way this experiment is set up is not only to create a superweapon for the empire. dukiba (as well as whoever really sent him that assignment originally) has another ulterior motive behind it, and i wont say anything else.

*** Well for one there is a definite sign that the galacric federation is actively at war. Which is not something I was aware of in canon, but I kind of actively loath the sequels and show so I don't generally consider them canon.

** First, to get my pointless nitpicks out of the way: - Jumba's last name is Jookiba, not Dukiba. - The mean girl's name is Myrtle, not Mildred.

Okay, now that I've satiated my inner child, this was okay. My biggest worry is that by bringing political intrigue into the story you're going to detract from the theme of the original. The changes made to Stitch make sense, though I miss Jumba's humorous eccentricity. I can't critique changes to Pleakley I haven't seen, but I also found him funny in the movie so I'd still like him to be funny here even if he isn't an idiot.

In term of writing, the biggest mistake you made was putting the exposition about Lilo's behavior after her the fact. You told us how she was thinking instead of showing it, and it broke the pacing. Put the narration in the moment so we see what character's are thinking as they act on it. That said, your explanation of Lilo's psychology is pretty good and makes a lot of sense.
