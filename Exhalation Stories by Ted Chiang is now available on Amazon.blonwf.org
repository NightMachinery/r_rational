** This is a second collection of short stories written by Ted Chiang who is very popular with this subreddit for his intro to rationalist fiction story named Exhalation (the title isn't a coincidence, it's one of the stories in this collection).

The first collection was [[https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang-ebook/dp/B0048EKOP0][Stories of Your Life and Others]].

It's hard to explain why his writing is so good even though I usually dislike short stories. I suppose it comes down to the world building and how well he can show the logical outcomes of a world which wouldn't be expected from the first impression.

Both of the books are within the top ten of Amazon's rankings for Short Stories Anthologies, #1 and #7, if that helps.

*** What I like about Chiang is that his writing is "quiet", if that makes sense? Like, he doesn't fill the stories with action but with ideas and thoughtfulness? It's really... peaceful to read them? It feels kind of meditative?

**** BOOM!

You just managed to describe exactly what quality I liked so much in his writing that I couldn't articulate at all.

The only other author I think that ever comes close is Robert Heinlein, but that's more the philosophical and thoughtfulness aspect and his writing isn't as "quiet".

Other people have recommended Liu Cixin and Liu Ken as similar authors, but I haven't read anything by them, so I don't know if that's true or not.

***** It's a type of story I really like and haven't been able to find. I think /The Time Machine/ was similar, and although I didn't care for it, so was /Rendzevous with Rama/, but Ted's got better ideas than either of them (admittedly HG Wells's big idea was time travel at all, really, so I'm not giving him enough credit, but modern sci fi audiences demand more sophistication).

** How many of these have never been published before? Because a few of them have definitely been published in magazines.

*** I believe six out of nine have been published before, but I can't be certain.

Here's the titles if you want to check for yourself:

- The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate
- Exhalation
- What's Expected of Us
- The Lifecycle of Software Objects
- The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling
- The Great Silence

- Omphalos
- Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom

The last three are new to me and I have never read them anywhere else.

**** I don't recognise the last 5, and some of the others are hard to find legitimately, so seems worth buying.

***** Yeah, there used to be a site somewhere that hosted most of his short stories for free, but I think it has been taken down. Also, Subterranean Press and Strange Horizon magazines would have his stories online free for reading, but they (most likely) took the texts down when he planned to publish them.

EDIT: I just found the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927090558/http://www.freesfonline.de/authors/Ted_Chiang.html][site]] that used to exist by using the Wayback Archive. If you go to different times for when the page was saved, you'll see different stories that used to be up there. It's a lot of work to recover all of the texts and not all of the stories in both collections are in there, but it's an option for anyone who doesn't want to pay the $14 to Amazon.

****** Just a headsup for people who don't want to pay: you can download the epub on piratebay, much easier than using that website.

** I AM SO EXCITED I LOVE TED CHIANG

damnit I have beeminder goals for other books but DAMNIT I AM GOING TO READ THESE

shit yeah I have no plans tonight. I'll hopefully post with reviews of at least one story tomorrow depending on length

EDIT: wait it's only available for pre-order on AU kindle store - is it released in the US already?! :( not out until Monday for me. There goes my excitement.

For anyone like me wanting to know what the stories are about, here's something I stole from one of the amazon reviews:

--------------

The Merchant And The Alcehmist's Gate (5/5) Great story about time travel. Unique idea, exploring time travel that cannot change the past but could still have an effect. Really well done, story within a story. Loved this one, had me hooked from the beginning.

Exhalation (5/5) This one will stay with me for awhile. It's an alternative universe that is populated with only robots, but they have no idea where they came from. Without giving away too much, one of the robots starts to explore the underlying anatomy and discovers new things about their world and himself.

What's Expected Of Us (4/5) Good, but short. Interesting exploration on free will and whether its possible through the guise of a very simple machine invented in the future.

The Lifecycle of Software Objects (5/5) Both my favorite in the book and the longest. The author assumes that A.I. will take at least as long to train as a human (20ish years) and writes a story that supposes the same thing. Great story that explains some of the dilemmas of separating personhood from being human and what the consequences could be. The 'software objects' start off as a souped up version of a Tamigotchi, but by introducing a small amount of autonomy and capacity, Chiang shows how difficult decisions could be when considering how to interact with artificial intelligence.

Dacey's Patient Automatic Nanny (5/5) Another short one, interesting exploration about the limits of technological helps for relationships.

The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling (5/5) Great story that explores the similarities between a culture that learns the technology of writing for the first time with a culture grappling with externalized memory. Loved this one, second favorite in the book.

The Great Silence (4/5) Good story, about the similarities another species, like parrots, have to extraterrestrial life. Probably my least favorite, but still worth reading.

Omphalos (5/5) Really interesting exploration of an alternative universe where the majority of scientific evidence lines up with a very young earth creationism. As a Christian, I appreciate Chiang's incorporation of religion into many of his tales and his exploration of the tension that exists between spirituality and science.

Anxiety Is The Dizziness Of Freedom (5/5) Loved this one too. Great idea, exploring what it would look like if parallel universes really existed and we found a way to interact with them. Very complicated idea that is handled really well, great read and one that you will learn from.

--------------

I know for sure I've read Exhalation (I didn't love it as much as everyone else seems to have: I thought it was only interesting/good not excellent - maybe I missed something), but I really loved The Lifecycle of Software Objects when I first read it and I'm really excited to read it again when I get the book. The others I haven't heard of but although I love Ted Chiang I have to admit I don't furiously go searching for his stories in the far corners of the web.
