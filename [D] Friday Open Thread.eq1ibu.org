Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Welp. Here we are, half way through January, and the church I have to pass every time I have to go to Walmart still has a Christmas-themed message on its marquee board. They've had it up for like 6 weeks. I've thought about mentioning it here a couple of times but not remembered until like Sunday or Monday when there's not much point making a new top level comment.

It's pretty ridiculous, something like "if Christ never existed, then why is there Christmas?"

Do you think the person who wrote that was being sincere? Like, that seems like parody, like somebody making fun of the arguments religious people present in support of the truth of their religion. Maybe a non-believer trapped in the church due to family and local culture somehow got put in charge of the marquee board?

Granted, this /is/ a redneck town in the U.S. South, so if there's a real person who actually thinks that's a compelling sort of "GOTCHA!" argument then this is where that real person would live. It just blows my mind that that's on a real marquee board in front of a real church.

*** In communities with sufficiently poor epistemological norms, catchy-but-obviously-invalid arguments take off because arguments are viewed as soldiers. It doesn't matter that everyone smart enough can see exactly why the argument is bullshit - you can't /say/ that, because that will be taken as a signal of disloyalty to the cause.

Over Christmas, I was with older relatives, and someone showed me "a real video of Iron Dome", which was obviously a computer animation, but was passed off as live-action footage. When I pointed this out, they became /absolutely enraged with me/ and repeatedly demanded that I /google Iron Dome/, because /they thought I was claiming Iron Dome didn't exist, presumably out of an antisemitic desire to pretend Hamas doesn't launch missiles at Israel/. When I made very clear that I was aware of the situation in Israel and was not /denying the existence of Iron Dome/, just disputing the physical reality of the video they showed me, which /appeared to have recorded in something like GoldSrc/, they fumed and literally stated that they didn't comprehend my motives in pointing this out.

I think a similar dynamic is responsible for the popularity of memes like "if Christ never existed, then why is there Christmas?". It's a faux argument. The purpose of the argument is not actually to convince anyone. It's a test to sort your enemies by submissiveness and your allies by adherence to arguments-as-soldiers - and if you view arguments as soldiers, then supposed allies who don't adhere to arguments-as-soldiers are traitors and should be treated the same way as defiant enemies. It's a tool for the construction of an echo chamber, composed of people who are either very stupid or want to be.

That just seems too... Organized? Premeditated? Manipulative? Idk. It feels like you're modeling Level One thinkers with Level Three thoughts.

Like, this is on a sign out on the side of the road. In trying to find the term for "the sign in front of churches" I read some things written by pastors for what sorts of things churches should put on their signs, and it seems like most churches use those signs to display messages that they think will draw people in to come to the church. I don't feel like it's likely that they put that message there for the purpose of scaring away people who have common sense.

For comparison, in France, we call the holiday "Noël", and there's a general understanding that it's a pagan tradition that was reappropriated by the Church, with added symbolism that has been warped and codified by 20th century commercialism.

Like, I remember watching that episode of The Simpsons as a kid where Lisa goes "I can't celebrate Christmas anymore, I'm a Buddhist!!", and being completely baffled by it. Why the hell would you need to be christian to open a bunch of presents and eat cake with your family?

It's nice to get a "new start", so to speak, and I feel like I'm not losing terribly much on larger sites like this when shuffling identities. In my earlier experiences on the web (c. the mid-2000s) I feel like I found myself in much smaller communities of a few dozen members, where everyone knew everyone else and deeper, persistent relationships could form. But in larger spaces I'm unlikely to really encounter the same person enough to be able to recognize them and they me, so the benefits of having a new name outweigh the costs of severing a few very meager, superficial ties.

I don't quite understand why you do the recycling. Is it just the "new start"? How is that enough value for the trouble of, at least a dozen clicks, and even writing several characters on the keyboard? I mean, if the site is large enough that your identity has no value, how can abandoning it have some?

I tire of this name (though I was quite happy to have imagined it) and wish to try another. That's easily worth the triviality of a dozen clicks and several characters!

Your account only has a few dozen comments made in the same time I've vomitted up several hundreds. I can see the relative burden switching would incur were you to create new ones with comparable frequency.

Plus, the possibility of doxxing is non-trivial -- I've written some... controversial things, one might say, that doubtless many of my peer group could find quite revolting, if the sort of sputtering I receive online in response is any indication.

A lot of people in my internet peer group of the time poked fun at me for the name, and I eventually switched to "PoignardAzur" ("azure dagger"), which is essentially synonymous but sounds a lot less awkward. I sometimes use NarrateurDuChaos ("Chaos Narrator"), probably inspired by Pen of chaos and/or Reflets d'Acide.

Anyway, I never really recycled the accounts, I just created new ones as I moved to different social media platforms, which is why my cameo in r!Animorphs is called "Sergeant Knife" (I guess "couteaubleu" sounds kind of cool if you don't speak French).

*** I have a pattern of deciding I want a new username to represent a new focus in what I want to post about, picking a name that's appropriate to that topic or posting style, then almost immediately changing posting styles to something that doesn't work with the new name. Maybe every six years or so.

I had a perfectly reasonable name that was a bit linked to my professional identity, wanted something better for shitposting, and immediately spent most of the time on that doing serious posts on feminist boards. Later I decided I wanted a name better for representing my professional projects, and mostly ended up using it to complain about capitalism.

** So, Weasel World Tour continues!

I'm going to be in LA, SF, and Vegas during the first two weeks of February. I'm following my husband who is following a band.

Anyone want to grab coffee / meal / touristy activity as I'm passing through?

Also, we need to travel from LA-->SF in one day. I want to drive - it's much cheaper and less stressful than flying IMO, and an eight hour drive split between three people (husband's best friend) is completely within the realms of what we as Australians think is culturally normal (I know I've driven 10 hours in one day split with one other person for work last year, with me doing about 60% of it). Is this a terrible idea, doomed to failure? Already planning on hiring the car for 3 days so we aren't stressing about returning it on time.

Any tourism recommendations for LA, SF, or Vegas? I'm literally going to Vegas to see Penn & Teller before Teller inevitably retires (he's just taken like two months off for back surgery!). I'm not staying at the strip (my hotel is near the airport), but the money I'm saving not staying at the strip will pay for Lyfts. I'm not a gambling person.

Also... how worried should I be about crime? I apparently lived in a dodgy area of Paris (I never once felt unsafe, but maybe I should have, IDK), but the thought of ending up in dodgy places where /the criminals routinely have guns/ terrifies me, and our SF hotel is like 10 minutes from Tenderloin. My parents said I should have a money clip with a $100 note on the outside and a bunch of other notes on the inside and if someone tries to mug me, I should throw it and then run in the opposite direction. Is this... actually a good idea?

*** LA has a few nice weird things. The "Museum of Jurassic Technology" is a good afternoon thing. The museums at USC usually have a cool rotating exhibit (I dunno what's there now?), and there's a few more excellent art museums around. If you can do an evening, I recommend "Clifton's" downtown for drinks.

If you're a foodie and have a serious budget, there's a few places I can point to. If you want to stay on the cheaper side, there's others. If LA has a "specialty", it's actually raw food. No one does the hippie thing better than Westside.

For SF, I recommend doing the "Exploratorium" and then eating at The Slanted Door in the ferry building (they're blocks away from each other).

Drive time is ~6 hours, but you want to pay attention to miss traffic on both ends, or you'll get fucked.

I would not generally worry about crime. You will not want to walk through LA's Skid Row, but there's no reason you would. I'm less informed about SF, except that cars get broken into (while you're gone) all the time. I would, in general, not worry about crime; I walk around all over the place all the time and never had an issue. Then again, I'm a moderately sized man. If you're worried, just lyft/uber instead of walking if you're at all worried about the area. Note that in both LA and SF you can go from ritz to oh fuck in like two blocks, so don't worry about being that close to the Tenderloin. Also, weed shop nieghborhoods usually look sketch but they're actually pretty secure while the shops are open.

I love food, and enjoy expensive meals on occaision, so it's definitely possible. Vegan, though, which means I was more or less planning on going to the most highly rated vegan restaurants in those areas (me and my husband are so excited to try the Impossible burger). Not a huge fan of raw food, but hey, if it's good it's good.

***** I'm not super sold on the Impossible Burger. I'd rather go with class raw food.

Cafe Gratitude is the classic and there's a few around LA; and Abbot Kinney has The Butcher's Daughter.

Sugarfish is really good sushi, [[http://destroyer.la/]] is an amazing lunch spot in Culver City and it's food is nothing like you expect from the name. I've never been to Vespertine, but it's like $300/person and is supposed to be riduculous. You eat each course on a different floor of this building or something? The Tasting Kitchen is more "normal" fine dining ($150/person with wine pairing?), and the LA Dining Car is a 24 hour gourmet steak and lobster place.

At some point, get street tacos. I'm talking the full kitchen on a street type places, not the one person with a skillet ones. They're the staple late night food, too, since a lot of restaurants aren't actually open that late.

Food trucks are also a huge thing, and there's various evening meetups (like a farmer's market, only at night, with food trucks instead?) all over the place at different times in the week.

I'd love to have the impossible burger so that way I know enough to not be sold on it :). Thanks for the raw food recommendations - will definitely check them out especially if they're the local specialty, vegan-wise :D

300 USD pp is.... something I'd really love to do one day. I'm not sure if today is going to be that day, though.

Street tacos sounds awesome. I've heard the mexican food in the states is something else. We both love the chain mexican stuff available here and are ready to be blown away :)

Oh! Go to Santa Monica beach on a Sunday and watch (or join in) with the acrobats, and then go eat at Cha Cha Chicken's. It's amazing. A couple blocks away there's also a Mexican place with something like six different kinds of mole sauce.

By and large I would not otherwise eat in most LA mexican /restaurants/ - they're, I don't know, watered down? But the street food is amazing, and there are a few real gems.

Tocaya Organica is a good vegan mexican / moden america fusion place with a couple of different locations.

And yeah, Vespertine is legendary. It's supposed to be one of the major locations for molecular gastronomy, and I think the build it's in is from an architecture school in the area? It's weird.

*** Flights from LA to SF are surprisingly cheap, but driving between them isn't a problem. Depending on the day of week and time of day, and where in LA you're leaving from/where in SF you're going to, traffic can add up to like 2 hours to the otherwise 6 hour drive. If the time isn't a big issue, drive up the coast even though it's a bit longer, the views are worth it. No idea what the cost would be to rent a car in LA and return it in SF, there's often an upcharge for that, but it's likely fairly common so it wouldn't be too bad.

If you do drive up the coast, it's worth it to stop at one of the nicer seafood restaurants around half moon bay. Make a reservation ahead of time if you're doing it on the weekend or after 6 on a weekday, they get pretty busy.

I don't have a lot of experience with tourist stuff in SF, but the one recommendation I have is the alcatraz island tour. You take a boat out to the island and there's an audio tour around the prison. It takes a few hours, but I had a lot of fun. You do need to make a reservation in advance for that too. The other tourist stuff is fine, Pier 39, Ghirardelli Square, the Ferry Building, etc. Mostly crowded and overpriced, but that's normal for tourist stuff and it's usually worth doing it anyway.

SF during February is colder than you would think, especially if you go out in the bay for the alcatraz tour. There's lots of parking, but you have to look for it and probably walk a bit. It's totally worth it to get one of the parking apps, I use spothero, that lets you find the cheapest parking and pay ahead of time. It's the difference between paying $8 and $30 for a days parking. Or just leave your car at the hotel and take an uber.

Crime isn't a big problem. The most likely thing to happen is to have your car broken into if you use street parking, but that's still fairly rare. You would have to be really unlucky to actually get mugged, much less with a gun.

It's going to be a Saturday, and the schedules I was looking at had us leaving between 7am or 9am (in order to arrive at lunch places around noon or one). I am very much open to learning what times in LA (we are leaving from Hollywood and going to Central SF) will be most conducive to avoiding traffic.

Cost: there's three of us with checked luggage, so the total cost for flights for us is about $450 AUD + lyfts each way. The total cost for the car for three days, drop off and pick up in central LA/SF respectively is $150 AUD + any garaging/valet fees.

Flights: also concerned about the time we'd need to leave the hotel to get to the airport in time to check in (apparently at LAX you need to check in 2 hours early for domestic?), traffic to and from the airport, and the risk of delays. Seems like the time saving is maybe not THAT much, though it is of course much, much safer.

Time: It looked like 6 hours for boring route, 8 hours for middle route, 11 hours for the really nice route. The 11 hour route won't be possible in one day, at least not if we want to be happy at the end of it.

Vegan reporting in, but I've identified several vegan restaurants on the route so should be okay.

***** Weekend is fine for driving. The important thing is to avoid weekday rush hour traffic at each end.

If you have the time and don't go that way on the drive up, a day trip down to half moon bay is usually worth it. Though maybe a bit less so in February.

I'm sure the vegan restaurants would have better stuff, but nearly all decent restaurants in both LA and SF will have good vegan options. There's a lot of vegans in the area.

*** I went to San Francisco on vacation this past August. If you felt the dodgy area of Paris was not noticeably dodgy, you probably will be fine with San Francisco. I have never been to Paris but San Francisco did not seem worse to me than the big cities in the northeastern USA I visit more often. If you're aware of your surroundings and acting appropriately, you should be fine*.

*I am male and not small, and had this pointed out to me when I commented on SF homeless vs other cities homeless. But I also assume if you have experience in large cities and feel able to cope, you shouldn't have a problem in SF.

I did not do Alcatraz because it requires advance reservations and is so popular it was too late for me when I selected SF as my vacation destination, but I was there in the summer so the waitlist may be shorter for you if you choose to try for tickets now. Lots of places have good views of it, in any case.

My first day involved hiking through Chinatown to Coit Tower, a truly awesome place of awesomeness. Coit Tower has Great Depression era murals on the ground level, good views of the sort of stuff you're likely to want good views of at the top. In Chinatown, I visited a few temples which mostly don't permit photography, sadly. The area near the gate is a tourist trap, so unless you like tourist trap stores I would focus on restaurants or the temples if you choose to go to Chinatown.

If you like hiking, the Presidio is great. Also for biking, no idea if the weather will be good for biking, thank you global warming for letting me ride my bike in January in New York where I thought we were supposed to have snow. If you like art, there is a nice museum called the American Legion in the Presidio, focusing on European art, and one called the De Young Museum in the Golden Gate Park focusing on American art. I rode a bike from one to the other, hugging the coast when not in one or the other park. The Palace of Fine Arts is not a museum but is pretty cool and I suggest it. There is also a science museum right next to the De Young if you prefer science museums. I am reminded of a roommate from my hostel who was a very new transplant from Adelaide and found the science museum delightful.

My dad charged me with going to Mark Twain sites. (He lived everywhere.) They no longer exist as such, so far as I can tell, but the Transamerican Pyramid is located at the spot where he lived.

I hung around the fisherman's wharf area a bit but it was, in my opinion, a bit underwhelming apart from the sailboats and the view. I liked the park/bicyicling compatible bits but not the tourist trinket bits. If you like tourist trinkets, this is the prime area for it.

The Muir Woods are very close, maybe a half hour drive at most, over the Golden Gate Bridge. Redwoods, giant trees, very cool to me, tour guides were like 'can you believe they wanted to log this', my family background includes logging adjacent activities and I can totally believe they wanted to log it.

If we were together in person, I could scroll you through the photos on my phone and give a really boring account of exactly what you should do in San Francisco which would consist of 'do everything I did but better.'
