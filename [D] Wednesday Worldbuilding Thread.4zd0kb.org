Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}

So, I've been thinking lately about spacebattles. Not the webforum named spacebattles, but the idea of manmade vessels fighting each other in space. I'm planning to run a campaign or quest based around a combat spacecraft and have been tinkering with the idea. Part of the inspiration has been my recent gaming: I've been playing a strategy game called [[https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris][Stellaris]] that is set in space. This strategy game has combat between fleets, and as common in science fiction, it's handled all wrong.

How, you ask? Let's explore!

*** Problems with space battles as depicted
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: problems-with-space-battles-as-depicted
    :END:
Well, basically, our combat comes down to a problem of physics and velocity warring with our romantic sense of what we want out of space battles. People like to read about WWII or Age of Sail type battles, with big capital ships pulling up alongside each other at low speeds and duking it out with broadsides of short-range weapons. Perhaps there will be fighters (like in WWII) or boarding actions (as you'd see earlier). Heroic captains would pull stunts to get on the "tail" of their enemies and defeat them with careful positioning.

In fact, this is not at all how space battles with advanced technology would work. This isn't even how modern naval battles work today. A naval confrontation today involves ships shooting missiles at each other from over the horizon, or launching aircraft that shoot missiles from similar distances. There are no broadsides or boarding actions. This only gets more pronounced if you put everyone in space. In space, there is no drag, so there's no top speed for something like a missile. Even without a warhead, a missile can strike an enemy ship (or planet!) from beyond visual range at relativistic speeds.

Right now, today, we can and have fired rockets from the surface of Earth to strike a target on the surface of Mars with an accuracy of within 200 meters. This is a lot more impressive than it sounds, since the rocket had to exit one gravity well and enter another, dealing with atmosphere on both sides. We can expect future space weaponry to only be more accurate, with missiles flying across hundreds of thousands or millions of miles to strike their enemies at incredible velocities.

Missiles would not necessarily need a warhead, since they would have so much kinetic energy, but besides the standard nuclear payload, you might have a missile that carried a weapon (such as lasers or EWAR) in the way a fighter does today. Missiles would be basically unavoidable due to the high acceleration they could pull; whereas humans can't survive many Gs of acceleration, missiles could be engineered to handle it.

*** What space battles would probably look like
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: what-space-battles-would-probably-look-like
    :END:
With no real top speed (except c) on missiles and ships, it's really hard to imagine close quarters combat. It would look like a joust, basically, albeit one at relative speed where nobody passes within 10,000km of each other. It would start when two ships identify each other from opposite ends of a star system, or from two different points in the system. Then, depending on the quality of their drive systems, they accelerate towards each other or a common objective. At some point, hundreds of thousands or millions of miles away from each other, they enter combat range and launch missiles. The missiles streak across the void between the ships, with multiple volleys being launched before the first one hits. Missiles hit, striking or destroying one or both ships. The ships then shoot past each other at relativistic speed and barring particular angles (like one chasing another) don't fight each other for quite some time. Turing around or slowing down takes as much time as accelerating does in space! Both ships being incapacitated/destroyed will be a common outcome here.

*** Honorverse, a series with accurate space battles
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: honorverse-a-series-with-accurate-space-battles
    :END:
Interestingly, there actually are sci-fi novels that depict space battles fairly accurately. A classic example is the Honorverse novels. Although I consider the Honorverse novels to be a bit of a guilty pleasure, David Weber basically nails how space combat works and actually makes it interesting. Most battles take place at a distance of like 100+ thousand kilometers, and revolve around missiles and anti-missile systems. The science fictiony part of the technology (reactionless drives, FTL travel, etc) have their logical consequences explored so that combat makes sense. For example, missiles are fitted with smaller versions of the reactionless drives that are on space battleships, and are very hard to avoid due to their speed.

The technology is clever. The drive systems of the spaceships have generate force fields, as well as a pair of strong force field plates that can't be placed in front of them, but only "above" and "below" the axis of acceleration. FTL travel is only possible pretty far out, several dozen or perhaps nearly a hundred AU from the star. FTL travel is not instantaneous, and it takes several days to pass between adjacent systems. The same system that provides reactionless in-system acceleration is also an FTL drive and provides "inertial stabilization" allowing the spacecraft to accelerate at hundreds of Gs without destroying the humans or structures inside it.

If you're going to do spacebattles, this seems like the way to do it. If you want to read Honorverse works, I'd start with /Shadow of Saganami/ since that one stands alone and is a personal favorite (and lacks a certain character who gets boring over time).

*** What I'm trying to do
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: what-im-trying-to-do
    :END:
I want to /not/ do what David Weber did with Honorverse. He took what we know about physics and derived a pretty realistic style of space combat from that. I want to put together a set of technologies or changes to physics that give us space battles like we see in Master of Orion, or Stellaris, or any of a variety of space fiction depictions. Ideally, I'd like to, from a list of specific technologies (shield generators, FTL, etc) make it so WWII style naval battles are the only real way to fight in space. This is a big challenge, since it's already true that WWII naval battles are not effective, and people always want to be accelerating.

The main problem to address here is engagement range. As long as battles are happening from outside of visual range, they're boring. Star Wars understood this; for some reason all the spacecraft are always right on top of each other. Does this make sense? Maybe not. But it's sweet. I don't want to hand-wave away all that stuff though, I want it to make sense.

*** Blazinghand's space magic / tech system thing
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: blazinghands-space-magic-tech-system-thing
    :END:
So, here is the mix of techs I think will fix the problem of "relativistic missile jousting is the best strat" that realistic space battles face. Please let me know if there are flaws here! I want this to stand up the the scrutiny of power gamers trying to optimize their ship and characters in the setting, so it must at least pass casual inspection.

*Grav Drive: L-FTL and S-FTL*: There are two usages of FTL, both generated by the same "grav drive" technology. L-FTL can be used to travel long distances between star systems, but this can't be done within like 100 AU of a star. S-FTL can be used for in-system travel, but can be interdicted easily by someone who is close, so it is difficult to escape using it. Neither L-FTL nor S-FTL grants you velocity; after the FTL sequence ends (duration higher for longer distances), you're dumped out at low speed. Grav drives are very large and expensive.

*Grav Drive: Inertial Control*: The Grav drive also works as a reactionless drive that converts energy directly into inertia/momentum. It can be used to accelerate or brake (which is just accelerating in another direction). It also allows for artificial gravity inside the ship, so the ship and its inhabitants are always under one earth gravity. The same technology that allows for the bending of space to jump to warp allows for power plant output to be converted directly to a change in speed via some kind of "gravity" technology that isn't fully explained but must be accepted as a premise of the campaign.

*Grav Drive: Interfering Grav Shield*: The Inertial Drive also generates a "gravity bubble" passively around the ship if it's not actively entering or existing an FTL jump. This bubble, called a Grav Shield is very sturdy and prevents almost all weapons from dealing damage. It is significantly weaker if in a deep gravity well (such as on the surface of a planet), or when close to (within 100km of) another Grav Shield. It also produces an S-FTL interdiction effect at this range. One common strategy is for smaller ships to power down their grav drives so they can stay close to the large ships without interference at range (probably inside the larger ship's Grav Shields). Once they close to combat distance with the enemies, the smaller ships power up their own Grav Shields, since interference will be happening anyways.

This doesn't solve the top speed problem like they do in Eve (by giving ships drag/friction in space, ew), but I think it removes most of the need for ships to move at relativistic speeds. To actually defeat an enemy vessel, you need to close the distance between the ships until they are close. Once they are in attack distance the Grav Shields interfere and become weak enough to penetrate. This is easily doable with S-FTL. Once they are at close range, S-FTL is interdicted by the Grav Shield interference, the enemy can't simply warp away every time you engage them in battle. Long range missiles on their own don't work well because outside of very close range, ships shields are hard to destroy. This might create a dynamic where some ships hang back and shoot missiles, while some ships go in to disrupt the shields of the enemy, but this could actually add to the fun.

So, the goal would be to have these be the FTL/gravity/shield tech in the RPG campaign, and to have this tech/magic system promote what we think of as romantic space battles, with fighters and close range combat etc. This particular set of rules that I worked back to starting from a final result of "WWII style naval battles in space" and has gone through a couple iterations of "wow, here's an obvious problem, how do we patch this" which is why it seems a bit patchy and weird. Hopefully it doesn't seem too obvious that the rules are a direct result of trying to reach a traditional spacebattle result.

In any case, is there anything I'm missing here? Obvious flaws in the system? Things that, if exploited by a canny player or reader, would show that the way spacebattles are done doesn't make sense at all? Let me know if you have advice.

**** Depending on the exact interactions between technologies and the factions' current meta, I think this might lead to Carriers + Bombers/fighters being a more dominant strategy than WWII style battles.

The goal would be to get your bombers next to the enemy ship to drop their shield, and then shoot their unshielded ship using the large weapons on your carrier.

One way to disallow this would be to bound the available sizes at a corvette at minimum (any smaller and it can't hold a grav drive/shield), to a battleship or carrier (any larger and it would need two grav drives, which would interfere with each other). Fighters, bombers, and missiles could still exist, but they couldn't have the shields or the shield interference powers that are implied by them.

Another idea is to have the shields merge instead of negating each other. If there's a group of five ships close together, they could each fire at any of the other ones, but no other ships could damage those five until they got closer. This would prevent the combo of sniper-ships and shield-dropping-ships from working.

***** Oh, good point about the sizes of the grav drive or shield. So, I'll introduce the following concepts, then:

1. Grav drive/shields are big and need a lot of power, so Corvette is the smallest reasonable ship size for this. Interceptors and missiles must use chemical rockets.

2. Shield merge instead of negate. So, allied ships often fly in formation to combine shields. Then, they take their combined unit it and fly it into an enemy and shoot the enemy from the combined shield that includes them both. Due to the unique properties of the grav drive, if you and and enemy both have a working grav drive and share a bubble, it is difficult to disengage unless the enemy is also trying to do so. Maybe the bubbles, when combined, have a sort of surface tension.

thanks for the suggestion!

**** I have a solution to your top speed problem. A side effect of shield interference could be that acceleration is cancelled out after a few seconds, so fast S-FTL ships are also fast in combat. If your thrust vector changes, then you have a new equilibrium velocity. You can probably push your drive to go faster, but it takes more power/fuel and risks burn out. There should be a reason why someone can't just turn their thrust off and on again to speed up, though.

I also thought of a way to justify WWII-style dogfights. Since fighters are too small for grav drives, they maneuver by riding or reflecting the gravitational waves generated by shield interference. The technology is based around the craft's surface area, so fighters are built with wings and fins. However, this increases the fighter's target profile and cost, so designers have to limit how large they are and how many they add.

Something you've already done may have started the process, and it's only a matter of time. Does that mean the best course of action is to immediately start learning what you can, to try and get enough upgrades that you can survive the eventual wakeup? Or do you GTFO and hope for the best? Try to seal it, knowing it can probably break out if it does wake?

This is the premise of Planetary Annihilation: you're a commander that woke up after Progenitors-only-know-how-long.

#+begin_quote

  1. There has to be a reason for it to be made in the first place.
#+end_quote

Why do you /think/ the Progenitors made a sapient war machine capable of conquering a star system or three in a week, and a galaxy inside of a few months? So they could kill the /other/ Progenitors, of course!

#+begin_quote

  1. There has to be a reason it wasn't just destroyed or ejected into space.
#+end_quote

Pick one of the following:

1. It ran out of things to conquer and engaged Hurry-Up-And-Wait-mode™, reclaiming all its units and hibernating underground.
2. The Progenitors had one hibernating in storage, but caught SMS ^{{(Surprise} Mortality Syndrome)} before they could reactivate it.
3. The Progenitors were betrayed by their creations. Progenitors and Commander mutually wiped each other out, except for the Commander itself. Badly damaged, the Commander limped into a cavern and went into a repair hibernation. The nanofabricators used all the existing reclaimed mass of the destroyed units, but this only got them halfway. While the Commander slumbered, the minuscule amount of /ex nihilo/ mass and energy produced by the resource core were used to repair its systems. Unfortunately for the Commander (but fortunately for the rest of us), its systems were too damaged to properly set a wake trigger. It is fully repaired, but has continued to sleep.

Facts about commanders:

- They are built out of +Bullshit+Progenitor-grade hypertech alloys. As is everything they build. This means they're hard to kill, but can advance materials science quite a bit.
- They extract arbitrary metals from the ground with specialty structures, and combine them to make the aforementioned hypertech alloys.
- They produce energy using some kind of fusion, annie plant, or zero-point energy. Or maybe some kind of quantum nonsense. Suffice to say it's cheap, efficient, and doesn't seem to need much maintenance.
- They transmit mass and energy between their units (which fab ammo as needed) and structures through a wireless resource network.
- They contain a resource core---a fantastically complex, delicate, and volatile device that produces a wee bit of mass and energy ex nihilo. This is enough to allow a commander to bootstrap an initial base in all sorts of conditions. If sufficiently damaged, it makes a half-decent anti-matter bomb. (Half-decent from the perspective of entities that consider planetoids a valid projectile, mind-you.)
- They have better cyberwarfare than you. The upgrade mechanism in the game is killing the other commander and stealing its tech.
- The first thing a commander typically makes after constructing a metal extractor and a power plant is usually a fabricator. These are bots equipped with nanofab sprayers. They come in such convenient form factors as bot fabricators (walkers, usually quadruped), vehicle fabricators (wheeled or treaded), air fabricators (don't let the name fool you---they're space-capable), and orbital fabricators (these are specifically optimized for orbit, but can work in atmo too). Fabricators can of course make more fabricators.
- Factories are just like fabricators, except stationary, optimized for a specific class of killbot (walkers, vehicles, airborne, or orbital), bigger, and more efficient.
- The two biggest weapons a commander can make are the annihilaser and the halley:

  - The annihilaser is an enormous laser that you mount on a planetoid. You then point it at another planetoid. Your planetoid now functions similarly to a death star.
  - The halley is an engine. It also mounts on a planetoid, usually in several clusters spaced across the surface. It serves the purpose of altering orbits of planetoids. Including orbiting planetoids /into other planetoids/.

In summary, the Progenitors left behind a sleeping BESRMoW---a Brutally Efficient, Self-Replicating Mechanism of War.

TL;DR: There are things scarier than a sleeping BESRMoW. But not many.

** Would the world of Harry Potter make more sense if it took place 55 years earlier? I came up with this because I thought it would be /neat/ Voldemort's rule over the Ministry of Magic coincided with the London Blitz. The idea appeals to me, though, since I think the time period provides a better context for wizard culture.

If the books took place during the 1930s and early 40s, then wizard society would be old fashioned rather than archaic. It's also a period where it'd make more sense for wizards to be so isolated, since recent history would make them not want to get involved in muggle affairs and technology is only just catching up to magic.

The only major impact on the plot is, of course, the presence of WWII. I personally don't mind Winston Churchill getting involved, since I think it'd be awesome if he took charge over the Aurors during the crisis. How the relationship between Voldemort and Hitler would work is unclear, or even if there'd be one, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/4xdw57/harry_potter_how_are_the_muggles_world_war_2_and/][Grindelwald's connection to WWII was left unexplained]] so it's not like I'm adding a plot hole.

I figure Churchill would just treat the situation as part of the Blitz. He'd only have to attend another meeting or two and allocate some resources to the wizard resistance movement. It would also open up a path for integration between muggles and wizards after the war, which would be necessary for wizard society in the modern age.

** Okay, folks. This isn't precisely "worldbuilding", but I'm in the early stages of a Zerg Overmind SI multicross, and I'm looking for additional worlds to... optimize.

What's a "Zerg Overmind SI multicross", you ask? It's what happens when the author gets copied by a ROB and dumped into the brain of a Zerg Overmind, then dropped in a fictional setting, and told to keep jumping from world to world, and he might get home eventually. The concept is based on Planetary Annihilation SI multicross fiction, where the author becomes a Planetary Annihilation commander. In either case, the SI is now a BESRMoW. Challenges typically start out more military, but become more socio-political, as the SI gets powerful enough to reliably say "I have the bigger stick" to nations unfamiliar with being outgunned.

My SI has the bonus feature of being a swarm of ugly-but-deadly critters, rather than a swarm of sleek-but-deadly robots. This debuffs his charisma a decent bit. Current world-list:

- Zombie Apocalypse
- Red Alert
- Mass Effect
- Master of Orion
- Dwarf Fortress
- Command & Conquer
- Firefly/Serenity
- Doom
- Warhammer 40K
- Worm

So, anything that you think could benefit from being "optimized" by a deadly swarm of ugly critters?

Well, that's an interesting concept. Might be possible if the SI arrives before she triggers, breaks into her shard's dimension, and hacks it. Or maybe if the SI hacks her existing shard connection after she's triggered, introduces her to the swarm, explains the problems of the setting, and gives her the ability to Administer a swarm on a similar level to a cerebrate?

Hacking the shard would be hard though. Need to go through a setting with dimension-hopping mechanics, study those, capture some parahumans, study their shard connections, refine the ability to hack the shard, then contact Taylor and offer her an upgrade.

Is it ethical to rope Taylor into the war, though? She's arguably already in it, but at the same time she deserves to have less of it if she wants to. Given who Taylor is, though, she probably wouldn't choose not to fight, even if the Zerg!Seylerius can handle things himself, even if it would probably be better for her not to fight. Is it even ethical to /offer/ Taylor more involvement, rather than just showing up and taking everything on himself?

From Zerg!Sey's perspective, giving Taylor control over a local swarm would have the benefit of not needing to create another sapient to hold down the Earth Bet end of the portal back to his hub world (his portals are powered by ugly amounts of psionics; they can be held open by an overlord, but require an overlord and a cerebrate on each end for smooth communication and control of the swarms on each side).

Didn't you see the Zergling in that HotS cutscene? Zerg can into cute.

I'd guess it depends on the extent of the power conferred by the vaguely-defined "psionics".

Well, if Zerglings qualify as bugs.. I was just thinking, Taylor would make a good QoB. And it'd match the canonical story.

I can appreciate their cuteness, but not everyone can.

Regarding hacking her shard, I'm thinking the straightest route there is to follow the dimensional tunnels in the Pollentia and Gemma. Once you've /found/ a shard, hacking it shouldn't be too hard with sufficient bioengineering and psionic might (which an Overmind can be assumed to posess in abundance). Take a bit of practice, though, which is why you'd need to test the process on some captured villains first (I'm looking at you, S9).

Most Zerg would qualify as dumb enough, but they're already being remotely controlled. The trick would be to bridge Taylor's existing psionic potential (along with the control mechanism of the shard) into the psionic network of the swarm.

The real question, though, is /should/ the SI do any of this. Not /can/, as I think we've mostly got that figured out, but is it ethical to offer this kind of power to a lonely teenager? Maybe if butterflies killed off Danny, and thus she didn't have anything to go back to, but I dunno.

What would they notice as different? The same? What's surprising, and what's not?
