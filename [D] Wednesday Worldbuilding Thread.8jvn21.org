Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** What would be the results of having a pocket world (dimension) that used a small contained fusion reaction used as a light source (miniature sun)? How would life be effected by radiation and solar flares at a relatively close distance (50km? 100km?), inside the atmosphere and being a closed system? Would everyone have to live underground, or develop extreme UV exposure issues? Skin cancer epidemic?

Temperature at land level is temperate. Could magnifying lenses be placed "in the sky" to increase ambient temperature in certain "planetary" areas? Create tropical biomes?

How would one simulate seasons? Would fluctuations in the intensity of the "sun" be sufficient?

Would evapotranspiration cycles still be able to work? How else could one simulate a climate?

How would these things change in an expanding pocket world?

I imagine a world of semi - perminant "edge towns" or a migrating workforce that would follow the edge, exploring and finding new resources as they "came into being"?

How would surface level temperatures respond to increased distance from the "sun"? How much distance would it take to effect ambient temperatures, or create "Arctic" zones?

Similarly, what effects would there be of having an Earth's "core" 50km below the surface?

*** I'm interpreting what you've said to mean you are planning on having a globe about 100 km in diameter with an atmosphere extending 50-100 km away from it, with gravity likely being produced by an ultra-dense core. You would have a (magically?) contained fusion reaction at the edge of the atmosphere which rotates around the globe to simulate a sun, providing day/night cycles and seasons. Correct me if any of that is wrong.

Regarding radiation and UV exposure, I doubt there would be a significant increase. Remember that none of the sun's UV light is absorbed until it reaches our atmosphere. As long as it's still passing through 100 km of atmosphere before it gets to you, it's still going to be filtered in exactly the same ways. Solar flares would also be unlikely provided you have some means of inertial confinement to make the fusion reaction possible in the first place.

You're probably not going to need lenses to make tropical zones. The fact that your light source is so close will mean that things closer to it get more light and heat, while things further away from it get less. Seasons can be done easily if you have your light source gradually changing its path throughout the year.

Regarding gravity, a core of gold and platinum (approx. density of 20 grams/mL) would give you a surface gravity of about 2.8% of Earth's surface gravity. If you want Earth-like gravity, you'd need to use your inertial confinement magic/technology to build a small neutron star at the core of the planet to get enough mass for earth-like surface gravity. Alternatively, you can use a ringworld approach with surface gravity simulated through centripetal forces.

As long as you have gravity (or simulated gravity), an atmosphere, and heat, you'll have evapotranspiration cycles. An atmosphere of 50-100 km will work just like our atmosphere does.

Depends on how it's expanding. Are we basically just injecting magma into the core and letting the surface slowly crack apart and fill with new land?

#+end_quote

This would be tricky. When you have huge temperature differences and only a short distance between them with no insulation, the temperature will rapidly equalize. Without barriers to block heat transfer, your best bet would be to make the 'arctic' areas a higher elevation above sea level than the other regions, and obviously not in an area where the 'sun' passes directly overhead. With increased elevation, warm air would have to rise to reach them, which would cause it to cool. With Earth-like gravity and atmospheric density, a rise of 4-5 km should be sufficient to get generally freezing temperatures.

The big problem would be overheating. In fact, that would be a problem without there being a sun. You either need a heatsink or to keep expanding it.

If you scaled down your star, then the radiation would get scaled down as well, so it would be no different than it is in real life. I'd be more worried about general energy levels than radiation. The atmosphere is equivalent to ten meters of water, which from what I understand is enough to filter out massive amounts of dangerous radiation.

#+end_quote

You could, but it seems like it would be easier just to move the sun. Also, you could consider bending the fabric of spacetime to create a lens (you can't really make a pocket dimension without bending spacetime) though I'm not sure that's any different than just moving the sun with an Alcubierre drive.

How exactly is this world shaped? I'm imagining a pocket dimension shaped like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-sphere][3-sphere]] with a sphere that splits it in half and the sun in the middle of one of the hemispheres. Or a better but much harder to explain way: split the 3-sphere into two toruses and have the sun move through one. That sort of gets you a day/night cycle, though it never goes fully dark. It might be better to use that for seasons if you don't mind not having nights. The topology of that is pretty confusing. I'll try to find something that can explain it better if you want.

#+begin_quote
  Would evapotranspiration cycles still be able to work?
#+end_quote

I think so, as long as you have gravity. If you can emit time as well as space that's as simple as making time pass a tiny bit faster the higher up you go. Otherwise it gets more complicated. Maybe if you go with the torus method, but don't split the universe evenly and spin it properly.

You want a pocket universe with a boundary? We have no physics for how that could work.

#+end_quote

Twice the distance cuts the incoming light down by a factor of four. Exactly how much that cools it depends on what you're using for a heat sink. On Earth we radiate light into space. Since the light radiated goes with the fourth power of temperature, four times the distance would mean sixteen times less light which means it would have half the temperature. But if energy is escaping through conduction then the temperature would be proportional to incoming light. And if it's not escaping then your world will overheat.

#+begin_quote
  Similarly, what effects would there be of having an Earth's "core" 50km below the surface?
#+end_quote

A hot one? You'll have more incoming heat to get rid of. Also, it will cool down relatively fast, though I'm not sure how fast. Maybe it will only take a million years instead of billions.
