** Still chugging along with this if anyone is interested, despite a disruption in December. For those not familar, this is intended to be a fairly hard mystery story in a science fantasy setting (for want of a better descriptor).

I'm planning to set a hard weekly update day following the next update, but first, I'm going to go back and clean up the story a little bit, and maybe make some small alterations to the pacing without messing with people who are already following. As always, I'd appreciate feedback on everything from the overall concept, to the general flow and how easy/fun it is to read, to typos. Of which there are probably many, as I still don't have a dedicated proofreader.

I'd especially like to know what point any one who tries it out but doesn't enjoy stops being able to maintain interest, even in absence of further detail.

** Just skimmed through the intro and prologue, looks very interesting. Is an epub version available?

*** I'm afraid not yet. I've only started doing this recently, and I'm still a bit of a hobbyist, so I'm not even sure how to do things like that.

**** Checking it out now!

PDF documents usually also work very well for people with E-readers.

Can convert from word document and paste it up in a public Google drive folder until you get too many readers. :P

**** I think AO³ generates EPUB versions automatically for things published there, for example.

** I do love the style of descriptions, but in the 2nd page of prologues I've yet to really find any description, summary or hint of what kind of story I'm in for.

This makes me hesitant in putting more time into what amounts to a very large quantity of text eventually describing very few things taking place to characters I've yet to be given a reason to care about in a world that I cannot yet tell what it consists of, with a strong feeling over it that it's the last days of a doomed universe (or planet?) that I have already been told to give up hope for.

*** You stopped right before the story really starts contextualizing itself properly (the chapter after Prologue 2) but I agree with you that the slow, melancholy opening is one of the biggest problems. As a solution, I've considered cutting the first prologue out completely and just dispensing the information slowly later, but at least a bit of it is essential to understanding the general premise, so it's been difficult for me to find a way to do that which feels natural.

A lot of the issue is that when I was structuring the story initially, something which is difficult for a mystery story to change without tearing a lot of it down, I was in a mindset that a serial could be written much the same as a novel, but that's obviously not the case. You need something to grab the reader quickly.

Do you have any suggestions?

**** I've studied some rhetoric, and my teachers suggested that it's always important to capture the audience/reader and set up expectations in the beginning of stories, speeches, etc, so like you say, worldbuilding may be better off waiting until you've given the reader an example of what is to come, kind of why Lord of the Rings starts with a minimal setup of the situation you're about to see, and then shows you an example of one of the massive fantastic battles that the series later became famous for before it goes back to the Shire to begin the story, dispensing more worldbuilding throughout the work.

Finding out that it's a mystery story in some kind of summary in the beginning (like how many fanfics have a short summary to tell you the central premise, or the blurb on the back of books - it's all about attracting the kind of audience that you think your story will appeal most to. Attracting someone hoping for a political thriller or an action story isn't very useful since they'll just get bored.

Other than advertising what kind of story it is in advance, you seem to have a pretty good handle of what the story needs to capture the audience you want, so my suggestions would simply be to implement those very changes you just mentioned.

I'm not personally a fan of mystery stories, but I imagine that starting the mystery story by writing (or if that'd be spoiling, tease with it) the parts of a mystery that you yourself find most tantalizing in other stories, like the hints at whodunnit that the investigator doesn't have access to and the like (Not certain this is a tantalizing part, just a suggestion).
