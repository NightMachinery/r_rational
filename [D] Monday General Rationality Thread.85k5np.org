Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Is there a better term to describe the concept of "information entropy in discussions"? Alternatively, "the rate of decay of actual information exchange in argumentation and communication versus the participants simply saying things without either listening or recieving the information."

I see this all the time, but I have no succinct way to describe it. But when two people get into an argument, either online or in real life, it usually doesn't last longer than 2-3 exchanges before the argument moved far outside of its practical scope and is really just about gaining a social status or tribe advantage over the other person.

If such a term does exist, finding general ways or policies to improve it would go a long way in improving discourse everywhere.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7x8x3q/dude_uses_homebrew_genetic_engineering_to_cure/][man creates and uses gene therapy on himself]]

This is a video of a man supposedly curing himself of lactose intolerance by introducing a gene he lacks into cells in his gut via constructing and administering a virus encoding that gene.

As you'd expect, a lot of the comments are about it being a stupid risk, and this type of gene integration does have serious risks associated with it. But lets say for the sake of argument it worked. Are the risks worth it?

Adeno-associated viral vectors (the type of viral vector he apparently used) are pretty good at targeting a set location in a particular chromosome but do have some incidence of off-target integration.

This means there is a low chance for a vector to insert the gene in a place that could be harmful if it disrupted an important gene. This isn't particularly dangerous when its just one cell, which will likely be triggered to die and have no real effect on the person.

As I understand it, the real danger would be if that rare off-target integration event by one particular virus triggers whats called an oncogene. Oncogenes (or proto-oncogenes until they are activated) are essentially genes that when triggered or disrupted in particular ways cause cancers.

If such a gene were to activate in a cell and avoid triggered cell death, you'd have a cancerous cell expanding in your gut.

But this would seem to be pretty low risk. I'm not sure what the viral load the guy ingested was, but say it was many millions of viral vectors, the chance of triggering an oncogene is apparently still very low: doi.org/10.1182/blood-2010-08-302729

Youtube videos showing how to create your own gene-therapies are pretty scary (and cool) but is the response to that guy's self-administered gene therapy an over-reaction? Can we equate the risks associated with these types of therapies to say for example the risk we take crossing the road to work every day?

*** People's conceptions of acceptable risk vary a lot by topic; this doesn't seem particularly unreasonable by the standards of what people regularly do (eg. smoke cigarettes or weed). It's not something I would do, given how conservative I am around risks of death, but I think looking at the relatively small risk instead of the technical and cultural phenomena this represents is a little like looking at a major announcement and only talking about the fact the narrator said he smokes.

*** It seems that the consensus of the knowledgable people in the thread were that the risk was too high, although I didn't see anybody providing numbers, so you probably couldn't equate the risk to crossing the road.

I could imagine a world in which the probability of getting cancer/other negative consequences were low enough that my expected utility would be higher if I chose to go through with the procedure. I've been trying to find a systematic way of assigning proper utilities to my preferences but the ways I know break down when you throw in probability.

**** I think so.

Open-source 3d printing plans are apparently available for printing out lab equipment (designed for to make lab equipment cheaper for third-world countries).

You can buy the reagents you need from sigma or similar websites and the methods are theoretically publicly available through journal articles and patents.

There is still a large barrier of knowledge, money and trial and error to do anything significant but its possible. But things like transmissable viruses aren't that readily avaialble and working with them is far from easy.

It seems to be a somewhat overlooked regulatory blindspot at this stage. Experimenting on yourself is generally legal with gene therapy you have potential containment issues.

** Do we like physics? [[https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-find-a-way-to-see-the-grin-of-quantum-gravity-20180306/][Researchers have devised a method to determine if gravity is a quantum force.]] Whichever way the experiment turns out, it will be most interesting, since the Standard Model is silent on this issue. I'm on the fence here and can't decide which way I think the experiment will go. On the one hand, I thought gravity was just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity][geometry]], that is, the stage upon which physics plays out. On the other hand, it's just a set of field equations, no different than the others. But if so, what sort of mathematics allows for superpositions of spacetime manifolds?

Anyone care to speculate?

*** The lack of evidence regarding the existence of a graviton, and the fact that the math breaks when we consider gravity as a quantum force lightly suggest that gravity isn't a quantum force. However, I wouldn't be significantly surprised to find out that it was.

Regardless, I would be surprised if it had an appreciable effect on quantum interactions considering the scale both in terms of mass and distance.

But that's the whole point of the proposed experiment: it's a scale on which both quantum and gravitational effects are measurable.

I've seen this idea presented in various pop-science books: that the probabilities start coming out as negative, or infinite. Such results are highly indicative that the mathematical model is fundamentally flawed. That doesn't mean that gravity isn't fundamentally quantizable, but that if it is, differential geometry is the wrong language for describing it.

*** Holy cow, if the experiment works then it'll go down in history as one of those devilishly simple ideas that is so obvious in hind-sight. If you want to see if gravity is a quantum force and there is no method to view it at scales small enough for quantization (they are all hidden behind event horizons in black holes), then the answer is to try inducing quantum phenomena such as entanglement solely due to manipulation of gravitational forces like how we already do so with manipulation of electromagnetic forces. Granted in this case it's 'easier said than done'.

I would bet somewhat firmly on the side of gravity of being quantum, because there is just too much evidence that classical formulation of gravity just doesn't make sense in the extreme boundary cases. Also, why would there be one out of the four fundamental forces not be quantum when the other three are? I would bet on 70% of the experiment resolving in favor of quantum, 20% of giving unexpected results that gravity isn't quantum /or/ classical, and 10% of the experiment resolving in favor of classical.

***** Have you told the person you love about your feelings? No? Then do that.

Yeah, you might get rejected. Yeah, that thought is scary. But if you don't know where the other person stands vis-a-vis a relationship with you, you have no information to work with. You need to know what your options are.

If you have told the person you love about your feelings, and they've turned you down? Well, that's sad, but it's their life. If they don't love you back, or only like you and don't want to push the relationship further, that's their decision. Trying to push your desires onto them... well, I wouldn't say it's irrational, but it's sure as fuck unethical.

If you love someone - really, truly love someone - then caring for that person's needs and desires should come first. And if that person doesn't want to be with you? Well, as the old saying goes: if you really love them, you'll let them go.

I'm not saying it will be easy, but nothing worth doing is easy.

*** The problem is, once you start asking about what "protagonists" would do, you put the context into "story", and stories have to be interesting and exciting.

So, taking away the "story" aspect and sticking firmly with the "life advice" aspect, IME, cut off all contact for 3-6 months, then trickle it back in: if it doesn't torture you to be around them, then go "back to normal". if it does torture you, then you might have to just cut off contact altogether, or wait another 3-6 months and try again.

Don't think of ways to win their affection or romantic gestures, don't remind them that you are in love with them: they'll remember---/trust me/---and they'll come to you if they suddenly have feelings back.

So, yeah, not "exciting", nobody's going to want to read a story about the person who avoids someone for six months until there's no longer complicated feelings... but it's probably good advice.

*** Assuming the person they love is a friend who already knows how they feel, they'd probably go through a bit of a grieving process while trying not to let it affect their friendship, make an ass out of themselves a few times anyway, use some cognitive strategies to help them accelerate the process of not falling into common romantic fallacies (pedestalling, worries about losing "soul mate," etc), learn to overcome feelings of jealousy or entitlement, and then ultimately have grown from the experience and secured a lasting friendship that doesn't cause anyone to be hurt.

That's how I'd write it, at least. Gotta write what you know, right? :P

*** Understand that I'm framing this as if I am giving real-life advice to someone with unrequited love rather than to a character in a story.

Assuming that you've already confessed your feelings or decided not to ever do so (maybe the other person's married?) and you want to move on, then I would advise distracting yourself. A lot of the emotional pain of moving on is within the immediate time period such as a few days to weeks, so intensely focusing on doing something enjoyable such as your hobbies will help 'time heal your wounds'.

I'd suggest picking up a brand new hobby since it's likely you've already shared your current hobbies with the other person. New hobbies help distance you from that period of your life as something that's completely untouched by any memory associations and the beginning of learning a new hobby is more mentally- and time-consuming than with a hobby you are already experienced with. Having something that's not linked to the other person provides distance.

It would be better to go with hobbies that involve other person than a solitary one, but it's fine to go with a solitary one if you prefer it. I suggest learning a new language. It's very absorptive and great at distracting you while learning, and there are often clubs for practicing communicating with other people in cities.

*** I think the standard grieving process is appropriate, and rational. I think this is a rather large topic to unpack (which is why there is so much pertinent media), and attempting to do so would come across as both quaint and cliché, so I'll just skip to the end:

The final stage of getting over the heartbreak associated with rejection of this sort is understanding that there exist very good reasons why it was "unrequited" in the first place. For the rationalist, I think this would mean learning empathy, particularly to empathize with the person who has rejected them.
