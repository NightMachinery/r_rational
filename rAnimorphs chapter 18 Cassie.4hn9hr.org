** All right, all right, I'm over the 20 min shock and I think I can start asking questions now. First off, holy shit. This is a lot of death. So here are my questions/comments about it:

- Writing-wise, this is an incredibly bold move. Do you plan on introducing a whole ton of OCs later, as the canon Animorphs setting is now gone?

- was this the only Earthside pool?

- does Crayak get to move his own pawns to safety? Who would they be?

- Illim? Tidwell?!?! Aftran... :( THE REST OF THE CHEE.

- CASSIE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

- Are Tom and Marco's dad going to be poofed to safety as free humans, or as Controllers?

- In terms of scope, how do you plan this war to progress? We've already quickly gotten to 'wipe the town off the map with a WMD'. What's next? Quantum viruses?

- What's the end goal here? In canon, it used to be 'get the Yeerks off Earth & defeat V1/V3 = win'. Do you plan on having your Animorphs (or some of them) dedicate themselves to chasing V3 back to the homeworld?

- Do you feel that there's a chance for peace? Quite a number of fanfics out there explore the potential AU of a cooperation between Yeerks and humans, post-war. Or, the possibilities of Yeerks moving away from parasitism to symbiotism. Ie the Iskoort future. From the way this story has progressed so far, it doesn't seem like this is in the cards...or is it?

- With the destruction of the pool, there goes the hivemind and everything it learnt about humanity. Does this mean that a new pool could potentially choose a different direction in terms of how it becomes established?

- Are we going to see V1 step in to yell at V3 for this tactical decision?

I think it's pretty easily argued that the Animorphs mere existence engenders a lot of the chaos and destruction on Earth "the Ellimist" has said he (Crayak) is so fond of. I also think that Visser Three's win conditions are probably not very similar to Crayak's, or rather that the success of the Yeerks is not something I think Crayak is overly concerned with in and of itself.

edit: though the truth is we just don't know and it's probably not possible to really guess at the goals and methods of the story's two near-omnipotent beings.

** Yayy! Update! The only way this could be better is if there was one of them every day.

- I really like how the Ellimist is portrayed. "I dunno. Seemed like the right [face] to use". Priceless :p

- Mhhh... something fishy is going on with the whole teleportation thing. Tobias was safe, away from the blast site, and free to warn the world about the invasion... Though we don't know yet what he had the time to do before being teleported. And I'm probably reading too much into it, but the Ellimists cuts them in a middle of a dicussion, right after Tobias pointed that he didn't belong there.

- By the way, the Ellimist never actually stated he was the good guy in their "order vs chaos" battle. I'm getting a sense of Goddess of Cancer vs Goddess of Everything else from this, and somehow I don't think the Ellimist will be on the side of Everything Else here. The most suspicious line being "One of us would like more of---this [destruction, people dying]. The other, less". Although if Crayak has made Howlers, that probably means that /he/ is... wait. Does the fic actually state who made the Howlers? The Ellimist interlude doesn't actually say who does what, only that stuff is done.

- I thought this was a surprisingly well-explained divine chess match you set up. I think this is a great quality in the fic so far, to take elements of canon as-is and re-describe them in a way that makes /sense/. It's the same impression I had from the pool scene, when Marco says "this is bad... like... Auschwitz-level bad".

- Damn you! This isn't how this episode was supposed to work! The kids were supposed to get some amazing insight from their tour with the Ellimist which would let them win the day by tricking Crayak with the sort of rules-layering that only works in books for 10-years-old children and... I kind of answered my own complaint there, didn't I?

- Anyway, one reason I really liked this episode is I read it right after having a big frustrating debate with a catholic friend about utilitarianism, consequentialism, the trolley problem, etc... So it was really nice to read about Cassie's point of view, and I confess it felt really cathartic when Cassie [spoiler alert]. Like I could mock her and say "See? See? This is what happens when you ignore sensible consequentialist directives and do what your heart tells you instead! Ha!" But I wouldn't do that. Poor Cassie already had a shitty enough life as it is (had?).

- Speaking of frustrating debates with Catholic friends... See? See? This is what actual evidence for God's existence looks like! He writes complex unambiguous messages by moving molecules around, and then just in case it's too subtle, he also stops time to have a nice chat with you.

- Garett's "I'm someone who does the right thing even if it's hard, period" oath may not be the most spectacular or glorious-sounding oath, but it really resonated with me in a simple direct way, more than even the orange lantern oaths. It's something to aspire to.

If you disagree that "A thousand lives lost plus two thousand lives saved just isn't the same thing as a thousand lives saved, period" then I think we need to talk about asymmetric loss functions and the many (MANY) objections to aggregation that have been built up in the literature.

I'm not even sure HJPEV would disagree with this sentiment. If Cassie behaves differently than he would, it's only to the degree that he had plot armor and she does not.

I side with Cassie. Team #trynottobeawarcriminal will live on in our hearts.

Edit: Your other bullet points are all perfect. Although, I'm pretty sure that in canon the Howlers are specifically stated to belong to Cryak.

**** Her reasoning there is correct. The problem is that even when she couldn't propose reasonable alternatives she still wouldn't get on board with the plan.

If she had committed to all the flawed plans, she might have been able to save a few lives by increasing the available resources. The greater the disparity of power, the more the stronger side can afford mercy.

Cassie's Batman-like aversion to murder---as a moral event horizon---had a real cost in lives, both human and non-human. If you can't achieve the ideal of your goal then you should take the best available option, and that's where Cassie failed.

I expect I would probably be similar to Cassie. I wouldn't be happy with any chosen course and yet would have no solutions. I hope I would be able to avoid wasting resources on futile symbolism, but I've never been in a situation that would test it.

**** Well, I'm not /that/ utilitarian, though I'd be interested to read about the strongest of the objections you mention. I wouldn't say that "save 1000 lives" is the same as "sacrifice 1000 to save 2000", but they're pretty close to each other when it comes to the decision you have to make if it's a choice between "do it" vs "do nothing".

Anyway, I don't disagree with any of Cassie's points, except for the part where she feels useless to the group: like Rachel pointed out, she's the only one with a moral compass strong enough to remain, um, accurate through horrible warfare, which is kind of important to avoid stuff like dumping thousands of yeerks into space for little tactical advantage.

Re Howlers: In canon, yes. Here? Everything mentioned so far about what the Ellimist and Crayak did has been extremely vague and didn't clearly assign actions or motivations to either of the two. For instance, the fic doesn't actually tell who made Rachel butterfly into existence. Maybe Crayak did it knowing she'd screw the resistance over?

** This seems like an extremely unsubtle move given just how subtle the interlude's description of interventions was.

So I notice I'm confused.

First, it implies the other guy did something equally unsubtle or that our guy has been saving up intervention points for a very, very long time. Both possibilities seem in need of explanation.

Second, it implies that that game is going very differently than our guy expected---otherwise it seems likely he would have pursued more subtle interventions to steer his pieces away from danger (or danger away from them). Alternatively, maybe this flashy intervention was needed mostly for the psychological effect it would have on the pieces rather than for the purpose of saving them? But in that case, it remains to be seen what his purpose was in getting Cassie killed---as something that causally near into the future should have been crystal clear to such a being.

** Pleasantly(?) consistent with the most irritating thing about Cassie's personality in the original series.

I also found myself remember the original Ellimist Chronicles, about how he puts his life on the line to destroy Crayak to save the galaxy, becomes godlike by accident, and then sits back and waits for Crayak to catch up and become godlike too before doing anything to him.

For the arbiter, I note that they could have used the same unassailable arbiter to broker the universe-halving division while preventing betrayal.

I also note that, in the moral calculus sense (justifying loss aversion), to a starving person the difference between enough money for no meals and enough money for one meal is of much greater value than the difference between enough money for one meal and enough money for two meals. The first half-of-a-universe either filled with or bereft of life matters a lot more (in terms of presence/absence of future potential, too) than the second half does, at least if you value life. Going for double-or-nothing presumably makes sense if the thought of /any/ life existing is torturous, and the last speck wiped out is worth more than all the rest combined.

** It sounds like the move allowance was based on mass * distance. Doesn't that mean demorphed Ax should count as two people then? Same for Grizzly Rachel?

Also, couldn't that math have been hacked to move everyone a short distance away first, morph down to tardigrades out something tiny, and then move them 50 miles out? That would let them move more of the robots (Chi, right?) or other high value people out of the 50 mile radius.

Other hacking opportunities: Instead of moving 8 bodies 50 miles, move 16 bodies 25 miles, with 8 of them being the Chi, and the 8 Chi should be able to transport the other 8 bodies 25 miles in half an hour. If they can't move that fast, then you can do the appropriate math to figure out how many people they can move.

Bring the morph cube over to Marco's dad and Jake's brother, move the yerks in their heads 1 foot away to free them, then give them the ability to morph and tiny creatures to morph into. Now they can morph them into something small and have low mass for low moving costs. Repeat this process with any other humans you want to save.

*** I highly doubt this was a munchkinable event. The Ellimist was not /limited/ to the atomic mass of X people, he was just going to have to offer X atoms of transition per meter to his opponent in the future, and so he wanted to minimize any advantage he gave away. He already knew their number and no doubt knew their request beforehand, and he had deemed the risk acceptable.

It also seems to me that this was a single "move"; it was going to happen in that one instant or not at all. They weren't exploring the limits of physicality (the Ellimist is capable of far more than he did), but rather were offered a single non-grid-aligned chess move. Taking (and thus allowing to Crayak) several short hops over a single large one seems to me to be the far more dangerous option to leave for your hyperintelligent superopponent.

  Give him a force of 100 Hork-Bajir-Controllers and tell him to take a strategically valuable spot on a hostile planet, he'd go in, take the spot, blow up two areas valuable to the enemy and come back with 200 new hosts in chains. I mean, he became famous when High Command assigned him to defend the Taxxon homeworld and he took out the Andalite invaders and came home with an Andalite host.

  He took down the Andalite invaders of Earth before they even reached the planet -- do you have any idea how hard it is to ambush somebody in space? There is no cover in space. He's great in a high-stakes warzone, which is frankly weird for our kind.

I think silence would qualify as a type of signal, but it isn't quite the same as, say, a piece of music or an encoding of the prime numbers.

Also, "unity" and "harmony" aren't generally thought of as opposites. The distinction would be that unity is "singularity", where harmony is "working together".

Personally, I think that this entity, whether Crayak or the Ellimist, is the one that wants more bloodshed. After all, the Yeerks don't seem to want to be bloodthirsty. If they win, they will unite all humans and Andalites into a single hive mind. There won't be any conflict, because in a sense every human will be every other human.

There will, of course, be trillions upon trillions of sapient slaves screaming in their heads, but they won't be killing each other.

If the humans win, it will be a much slower process getting to the point of universal pacifism, but hopefully that would be the end result. Publicise the Yeerk-human conflict and they might even catapult ahead.

But if /neither/ side wins, if they both keep fighting forever and ever, escalating until first the galaxy and then the universe are consumed in perpetual war... well, a non-definitive victory for either side here would be a good first step.

***** I may have been unclear. Silence is an antonym of noise, but it does not imply the same relationship as chaos and order.

Chaos and order describe the degree of structure in a system. An order-loving deity would try to build structure (such as planets, organisms, and societies) while a chaos-loving deity would try to tear it down.

There's a fairly obvious human moral mapping between the two: chaos is bad, order is good.

Noise and signal (treated as antonyms) map directly to chaos and order.

With noise and silence (assuming you mean "noise" as in "not silence"), it's not quite as easy.

A noise-loving deity would be one that tries to create things which make noise (like people, supernovae, and earthquakes). A silence-loving deity would try to eliminate every source of noise.

If you interpret it as "flux vs. stasis", the implication still holds.

Assuming all you knew about a deity was that it loved chaos, would you guess it preferred noise or silence? I'd say noise, as silence is definitely not chaotic by the colloquial definition.

That would imply (by exclusion) that the order-loving deity loves silence. There's a problem there; society and peace and progress are very ordered things, but none of them are silent (literally or metaphorically). Quiet, perhaps, but not silent. You still have to engage in a change of ideas.

My hypothesis is that the two entities are OUS (order, unity, silence) and CHN (chaos, harmony, noise). Neither of these has a desirable human morality mapping. OUS would eliminate us for being noisy and disunited, while CHN would have us constantly in flux. Which is the Ellimist and which is Crayak doesn't really matter, but I'd guess OUS = Ellimist and CHN = Crayak.

So where in canon the Ellimist is basically an all-around good guy that just helps out because his morality happens to line up with human morality, I'm suggesting that neither of them actually cares about us. We're just another battleground, and if ever one should win their game then human society is going to change beyond recognition overnight (either to static perfection or eternal conflict).

** Quick comment:

- I totally called the red/blue morality aspect of elimist and crayak :D - Interesting to think about how the human scale scharacters should act in these circumstances. When you know gods are playing games with you you could try and second guess their intents, but you also know they could know what you were going to choose anyway, so you get stuck in a morass of recusion. Could be an oppurtunity to introduce some omega style decision theory scenarios

- Cassie is interesting, very self aware in how she is violating her own principles. Reminds me a bit of some characters in worm. -

- On the specialness of the chosen 4, in canon it was because Cassie had some ability to sense changes to timelines, though that was never really explored. It also justified the coincidence of Elfangor's son, Visser 1's son, a natural leader, a fighter, etc all ending up as friends in the right place and time. Elimist was described as "stacking the deck". I don't think we've had any references to Tobias and Marco's family connctions so far, but I don't think its been ruled out either. Imagine r!marco would be less affected by it. Elfanor's earth backstory with time travel, non genetic inheritance, etc would be a bit hard to fit into the story, but I could see him having been on earth before in a diferent way

- Given we now have an animorph presence in DC and a wmd attack by V3 it would be very hard for the war not to go to full escalation right now. Unclear who would win given the yeerks explicitly have more limited forces in this version, but are more clever about using them. Hope the human authoritiies are also realistically competent, as teen books the originals played off 'adults are useless' a lot.
