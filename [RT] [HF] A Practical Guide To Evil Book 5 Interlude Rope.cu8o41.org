** Y'know... it occurs just how powerful someone with the Name "Scribe" is in a world where stories have actual causal force.

*** Makes me think - we've carefully deconstructed the myth of untouchable Malicia, and shown that Black can make mistakes, but even with the Black Knight as a close relation I don't think we've ever seen Scribe fail.

In fact I think it's been implied that she's limited more by ambition than by ability - she was always acting for Black before.

**** I think more it's also just a case of the calamities being forced to engage directly with more dangerous foes than before. Black lost because he was going basically solo against two of the continents most dangerous heroes while leading a crumbling army on a deathmarch through a foreign land. The whole plan was a tactical loss in exchange for a strategic victory. Malicia is simply beset on all sides, a large part of her previous untouchablility simply came from having enough resources to properly address all of her problems, now she's actively fighting two major powers while feuding with another and trying to put down unrest from two major internal factions, with either one or zero named under her (Assassin?), now that Warlock's dead. Scribe is still operating under the old model though, she's been placed in her ideal environment, only has a single opposing named to work around, and has had months to prepare. I'd argue that her success and Black's failure ultimately were both just causes of the relative difficulties of the goals Black chose for each of them.

** #+begin_quote
  /Agnes would have warned me/, Cordelia thought. Though her cousin's peering eyes had been on the darkness to the north and the madness in Iserre, she would not have missed so glaring an attack.

I suspect Scribe has at least one antimemetic Aspect that could hide her schemes from scrying, oracles and seers. Or, as Cordelia surmised, all communication from the Augur was intercepted from the moment the conspiracy began to move.

*** I think it was also mentioned in one of the calamity interludes earlier that Augur had two important limits, she couldn't intercept things that were not planned (Attacks of opportunity, etc), and she couldn't see indefinitely into the future, she only got warnings once a plan became basically 'fixed'. Still good enough to see troop movements and assassination attempts weeks in advance, but nowhere near infallible if someone is planning around those limits. If Scribe is behind this, it would seem likely that much of the plan was specifically built around preventing Augur from intervening.

** Assuming this is Scribe, why now? Hasenbach was going to sign the Accords, and Black seems to be in favor of them at this point. Scribe's only known character trait is her care for Black, and I cannot imagine someone of her talents not knowing her friend had returned from soul-shearing and communicating with him. Sure, they might get someone more amenable on the throne, but unless this plot is completely guaranteed it runs a risk of pitting Procer against the Accords from the beginning.

It could be for revenge, I suppose, but though Scribe is known to vindictiveness I cannot imagine her misdirecting it. Hasenbach had basically nothing to do with Black's fall, so if vengeance was the motive it wouldn't have been against her. It could be the general principle of destroying your enemies, but right now Hasenbach isn't really an enemy of Black's. It could be something yet unknown to us, but this far into the tale I expect this to be a puzzle which, while not necessarily solvable, has all the pieces in view.

My best guess is this has something to do with the Thing in the Lake. We still don't know for sure what it is, but if it is another dead angel, Scribe could be taking out the architect of that impending disaster as a matter of course. Hasenbach's escape from the coup is evidence of this, even, as it provides a dramatic midpoint for the story of the Horror Unleashed. We've seen very little of the way Scribe operates, but we haven't seen her be particularly good at breaking stories. That has always been Cat's wheelhouse, so Scribe could be the pawn here.

*** I think it's to strengthen Cordelia's hold on Procer by the most classical Praes formula. Start a rebellion that was doomed to fail.

The Church will be seen as unreliable, which in turn strengthens Cat's position as an actual diplomatic entity to Cordelia, as she'd probably /not/ listen to the people who just tried to kill her.

--------------

On the other hand, if the coup succeeds, well... Cat's just going to be negotiating with Scribe's puppet. Win-win.
