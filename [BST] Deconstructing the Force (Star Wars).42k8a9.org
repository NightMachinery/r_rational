Lately I've been trying to make sense of the Star Wars universe for some RP, using the same approach that was shown in HPMOR. It starts looking like there might be a consistent theory, but of course there are some roadbumps - for instance, my lack of knowledge in the field of particle physics. I hope some of you will find this topic enterntaining - and maybe together we can solve this mystery :)

First of all, some premises.\\
1) I'm using a wide definition of canon: as our RP takes place in the old "legendary universe", this means that most books, comic books and games can be used as evidence. However, some events or assumptions, especially rare occurences, can be treated as unknown or misinterpreted. After all, the authors didn't have a working model in their heads, so the best we can hope for is to explain /most/ of the "facts".\\
2) When we perform thought experiments, we can decide their outcome based on logic and common sense, but if some outcome isn't obvious - it's best to see what both options imply and go with parallel theories until one of them stops making sense.\\
3) Jedi and Sith might be biased because of their religions, but regular scientists probably aren't. If Force users don't know something - it can be shrugged off; if non-sensitive scientists don't - there's probably a good reason.\\
4) Just had to state it: I know that Star Wars was never intended to be sci-fi (and, well, that all of this isn't real). Neither was Harry Potter ;)

Here's the roadmap that I devised:\\
1) Making sense of most practical Force abilities.\\
This is an easy one: if we know that telekinesis exists, we can trace it to particle level and get our lightnings, mind control (via influencing neurons/hormones) and whatnot.\\
2) Understanding the nature of the Force.

This is where I'm currently stuck. Given that we have Sith amulets, we can easily conclude that the Force itself isn't contained in any living structure (midichlorians or whatever). Midichlorians might or might not serve as a mediator between the brain and the Force, but the entity itself is found elsewhere. Given that on the previous step I've already mentioned quantum level, it makes perfect sense to look for an unknown particle - the one that behaves as a field (like magnetism does) and influences other particles, thus allowing for telekinesis.

The question is: *how do we find it or disprove this particle's existence?* Given that "regular" scientists never built detectors of the Force, we must assume that this particle itself cannot be detected directly. But what indirect ways do we have? So far I can't think of an experiment that will make this hypothesis falsifiable.

3) Then we have the most arcane areas: spirits that can persist through death, switch bodies, haunt inanimate objects etcetera. This would seem to imply a certain "essence" or soul that exists separately from the mind and the body. Why do I think it does exist? Well, first of all, we have droids (artificial intelligence), which means that, unlike earthlings, we do understand how the brain works. If spirits are still a mystery - there must be more to them. Second: we can't deny those spirits' existence or say that they are mere "backup copies" like in HPMOR - mostly because of numerous accounts of body switching.\\
4) Finally, there are prophecies and visions that violate causality.

Actually, if a particle theory is correct, we can move further to explaining the Force as a cloud storage of information (including sentient clusters) that uses those physical particles as its carrier, but needs some kinds of mediators (people/artifacts/midichlorians) to interact with other particles. Even visions make sense if these particles behave like tachions.

However, there must be an experiment to find this field or move on. I hope someone can help me with it :) Thanks!


** There were pretty nice sources linked in this sub. "Timeless warrior" and "Truth of the Sith" had some nice ideas:

There is only one side of the force (the dark side). Force-sensitives use short-time precognition while fighting. Midi-chlorians are parasites feeding on the force, not its source, and are mainly useful for mass testing for sensitives.

Other stuff: Aside from explaining the force, you need to explain the absence of real AI and powerful computers (otherwise human pilots would be useless- even with today's computers).

Let the force come to rescue: For example, the force might link to sentient beeings and computation. However, the force is only really compatible with human-style minds. This also explains why all species think similiarly (no alien aliens).

If the force detects a computer and tries but fails to link to it, the computation is disrupted. Hence, no powerful general purpose computers above a certain threshold (maybe 1980s-level is the maximum possible). This prevents synthetic AI and useful non-sentient auto-pilots.

What about droids? Droids are (at least) semi-sentient and suffer from the same limitations as biological minds: No copying of experiences (each droid needs to be trained anew), no "hive-mind", no real modular structure, speed of thought comparable to humans. Explained by the force only allowing "human-style" (probably better termed "Sith-style") complex computation.

I'd guess building a reductionist pseudo-science explanation for the force would be a fool's errand. The force should probably be a "magical style" law of nature.

What about FTL-travel and the rocket equation? We see in-universe that energy is at least somewhat scarce. Hence non-FTL travel cannot use the rocket equation (otherwise the amounts of energy cheaply used for propulsion would dwarf anything ever used planet-side). At the same time, you need somehow kill Lorentz-invariance anyway in order to allow FTL travel.

Here the hyperspace ("the warp") comes to the rescue. So maybe space+hyperspace does not have Lorentz-invariance (nor Galilei-invariance); normal, in-system travel also somehow uses the hyperspace, but instead of traveling through it you just use it as an "anchor" in order to remove the constraints of the rocket-equation. This also gives you the nice property of "absolute speed" beeing a thing in space, interpreted as "speed relative to the preferred resting frame of the warp". "Nice" in this context would mean "good for epic battles".

*** Thanks for the links! I've read "Timeless warrior" but, sadly, it seems to be abandoned. I'll make sure to check the second one.

As for the Force being a law of nature - it's fine by me, but so far we don't have even that law. Alchemy in FMA at least looks like a law; the Force just works "somehow". A reductionist explanation might manage to preserve the "magical" part: for instance, my thoughts in the post are obviously approaching the concept of a deity (in a form of cloud storage). What it can give us, however, is a way to exploit the Force in numerous ways.

For example: telekinesis alone authomatically gives us a possibility to slice a vein in the enemy's body. With this, we no longer need powerful combat abilities and combat itself. To be honest, I don't even know how to block such an attack if I put myself in that enemy's shoes.

Anyway, AI limitations look like an interesting path of research: we can't mind-trick droids, and it's said that the Force unites "all living things". Perhaps that's another indication towards some kind of a "life essence" which allows such complex structures as a mind to function.

**** No, my model predicts that we CAN mind-trick droids.

My model predicts and explains that there is only one possible "structure of mind" because any other complex computation is disrupted by the force (hence evolution converges on this structure, as well as droid design). The force knows how to correctly interface with this type of mind, allowing it to be mind-tricked.

If you want Sith-amulets to be part of your AU, then you could posit that clever engineering can "trick the force" in order to interface with the amulet.

In my proposed model, the force does not "link all living things" (either flat-out wrong or just metaphorical). Instead, the force "links all minds"; it might have the following categories:

A (has no mind detected by the force): brainless plants, rocks, maybe lower animals, slow computers

B (has a mind detected and correctly interfaced by the force; not considered sentient by the force; can be mind-tricked): higher animals, maybe droids

C (has a mind detected and correctly interfaced by the force; sentient; has no access privileges; can be mind-tricked): non-sensitive humans/aliens, maybe droids

D (has a mind detected and correctly interfaced by the force; considered sentient; gets access privileges): force-sensitives.

Occam's razor asks you, whether the force actually makes the distinction beteween B and C.

Non-sensitives could be, in some literal sense, soul-less. This would allow for slightly more rational genocidal villains ("If even the Force itself considers these sheeple non-sentient, why should I care so much about their well-beeing? They are like droids, or like sheep! Farming is no slavery, and neither is butchery murder.")

In between A and B, there is an uncanny valley:

A+ (seems to have a mind; trying to interface; doesn't work; bugs are triggered / computation is unintentionally corrupted, since computers are fragile things): Evolutionary dead ends (stillborn) and failed attempts at computer-design and droid-design (metaphorically stillborn).

Computer design in this world is focused on either staying in category A or jumping directly into a higher category, which requires all kinds of crazy things: Why do targeting-computers of space-ships have to be semi-sentient, aka droids? Why to droids have to have motivations, desire for self-preservation, other desires, etc?

In order to survive the force's attempt to shoe-horn everything into its very conservative and limited concept of a "mind".

Or one could go the other direction and say that some animals have souls. Maybe this is a point of contention between Jedi and Sith? I don't recall Jedi being vegans in canon, but thematically it would fit them.

****** Well, in a world where actual souls exist, the question of "who has souls" is not so much a question of "what we can say", but a matter of fact, to be determined by experiment.

But I like your idea of this beeing a point of contention between Jedi and Sith, as this gives us three conflicting moralities to play against each other:

A. Sith morality. The moral weight of a beeing is determined by the force. Force-sensitives have much more weight than non-sensitive minds, who are like animals and mostly worthless. Non-minds are totally worthless. If a Sith encounters a force-sensitive animal, it will be considered worthy.

B. Jedi morality. The moral weight of a beeing is determined by the force. Force-sensitives have the obligation to protect the lesser minds (who are still in the same category as animals). Hence Jedi are vegan.

C. Protagonist / reader morality. Screw this force stuff; morality is a human judgement. A true moral relativist does not change his stance upon encountering a judging god (the force). Morally, sensitives = non-sensitive sentients > animals > rocks.

Timeless Warrior is good, but it uses a very different model of Force powers than the films/books. Jedi explicitly don't see future-visions as part of their normal combat precog, fun though that is as a mechanic.

** What if the Force isn't a particle, but an additional spatial dimension?

Everything in the galaxy exists in the ordinary 3+1 dimensions, but also in the 4th dimension. Let's call the fourth dimension "the Force dimension" or "FD". The FD is much smaller or denser, so things that are distant in any of the 3 "ordinary" dimensions are not as far in the FD. Patterns that exist in 3+1-space are somehow encoded physically in the FD.

Force users are able to move in the FD.

Let's see what that explains:

- General telekinesis (force push, pull, choke, etc.): moves an appendage through FD to push and pull objects. Pushing and pulling off-center (in the FD) causes motion in 3D.

- Enhanced athletics (speed, jump, etc.): pushes the force user along in the FD. Traveling slowly in the FD equates to fast motion in 3D because a short distance in FD maps to a large distance in 3D.

- Special powers (lightning, etc.): static friction from FD? A parlor trick performed by pushing a van-der-graaf generator completely into FD? Something to do with FD patterns? No idea.

- Mind powers (force suggestion, mind reading, etc.): the mind also exists in the FD, where it is exposed in a physical sense. State of mind, memories, and so on are patterns of neurons firing, behavior patterns, and structural patterns, and all of these are accessible in the FD.

- Foresight (predicting blaster shots, force visions, prophecies, etc.): some aspect of the 4th dimension of time is also projected into the FD, which gives people who have access to the FD, access to time. Another explanation is that it is simple extrapolation of broader patterns that are made accessible in FD.

- Spirits (force spirits, ghosts, body switching, etc.): force users can move themselves by pushing through the FD, and can access patterns that are splayed out in FD. A powerful force user can push their whole being (which is just a big, complicated biological pattern) into the FD. This severs their connection with ordinary spacetime, but they can still interact through the FD.

I think to make this work, we'd need several extra dimensions of Force Dimension, and also a mechanism for physical "patterns" in ordinary space-time to be encoded and physically accessible in the Force Dimensions.

Another question: why is the presence of one or more Force Dimensions not known to science? I think it is, and it's used in a variety of applications, not the least of which is the hyperdrive.

*** Nice, your hypothesis seems just as logical - I especially like how you combined it with hyperspace. I have only two points to add:\\
1) The widely spread mystical approach to the Force is evidence against the notion that scientists use it. Example just off the top of my head: Vader would hardly be able to say "The ability to destroy a planet is nothing compared to the power of the Force" if the Death Star (at least its hyperdrive) used the Force.\\
2) What we actually need is an experiment which will test at least your hypothesis against mine. What do we expect to see if an additional dimension exists - and if unknown particles exist? In your case I'd probably start marking atoms with radiation and looking whether or not they are "teleported" through FD when telekinesis is used.

**** 1) Consider what modern mystics claim about quantum mechanics - the seat of the soul, water memory, ESP, everything is "quantum"... because they don't understand it. Even though quantum effects are at the basis of commonplace lightbulbs, somehow they still use the idea as a source for magical thinking. Now consider Vader's position: he can use a power that nobody else (except the emperor) can, he was taught a bunch of mystical mumbo-jumbo first by the Jedi and then by Palpatine, he has intimate and fine-grained access to a power that drives starships, he knows it enables Palpatine to control the entire galaxy with an iron fist, and it transcends time and space. Furthermore, dark side users have very visceral-emotional experiences with the force. If you've ever taken dopamine or tryptamine agonists, witnessed the birth of your children, had a religious revelation or had some other extremely potent emotional experience, you'd know you're likely to overstate the importance of that experience. Especially if you're trying to impress your superiority over a pencil-necked general who just ordered the complete physical destruction of a planet.

Scientists don't really make much of an appearance in Star Wars, so it's hard to say what they have and have not studied. The galaxy has been ruled by religious fanatics for centuries, a religious order that benefits from suppressing the idea that the Force is mundane, and has been playing up the mystical nature of the Force as much as possible, so it's no surprise we only see that aspect presented. The fact that the handful lunatics that run the galaxy can /slightly/ access the hidden dimension(s) is completely irrelevant to the engineers and mechanics who build and maintain hyperdrives and all the other hyperdimensional technology.

2) That would be a good experiment. Another one would be to see if the instruments used to track ships through hyperdrive register Force user activity.

I thought of another technology that the FD can explain: low-energy hovercraft. In every Star Wars film, we see cheap, low-end vehicles /parked/ and hovering. So, hover technology is cheap, accessible, and low-power. I can't think of a better solution than putting the suspension in a different dimension, to avoid friction and moving parts in the ordinary dimensions.

***** Your ideas regarding FD remind me of the warp from 40k, its a psychically accessible spacial dimension where patterns in the real universe cast conceptual shadows onto the fabric of the warp, thus giving rise to structures and entities being born into the warp as the result of the collective actions of a civilisation. This also goes well with the whole 'there is no light side of the force' thing.

** Something that you should consider, is that levitation tech is apparently DIRT SIMPLE, nominally zero or negligible power requirement and so prevalent that otherwise none-technological beings or species tens of thousands of years earlier have utilized it and highly advanced cultures have not found any sizable improvements on it.

This makes me think that things like telekinesis is probably operating on a principle of the star wars universe that is well understood and extensively utilized.

#+end_quote

The amulet may hold some bacteria as a "living structure" to contain the Force. Alternatively, if we consider the Force as some kind of energy field that requires the presence of life in order to do anything, it's possible that these amulets are to the Force as a CD is to a computer.

What I mean by that is, a CD (I'm not talking about a rewriteable disk) isa static collection of data. Alone, it just sits there and does nothing. But put it in a CD drive attached to a computer, and you can run whatever program's on the CD. I don't know all /that/ much about the expanded universe, but it's possible that these Sith amulets are a bit like that - just static data, unmoving, unchanging, until some form of /life/ gets close enough to power it (and it probably drains a little life from whoever's around, explaining why this technique is more commonly used by the Sith).

So... there might not be a single entity (in the same way that you can't get an atom of Human, just atoms of carbon and hydrogen and stuff). The Force may be the result of combining some sort of external structure with an energy source drawn from life force itself. (This would also explain why Force users live longer - the subconsciously draw in some of the life force from plants and animals around them, perhaps an important part of Jedi training is about /not/ drawing in the life force of other sentients under any circumstances).

*** All right, this one is easily tested: 1) We take an amulet with a known effect (preferrably with no spirits at this stage) and test it in the hands of a Force user, then a non-sensitive, then a droid and finally a mechanism. This will tell us if the amulet can work "by itself", without any mind or life present. I think I'd expect similar results in all cases.\\
2) We desinfect an amulet (with reagents, temperature or vacuum) and check whether it works - probably repeating the previous test. Once again, I'd expect it to work. If it doesn't, we'll have discovered those bacteria :)

** An indirect way to detect Force particles is to look for midichlorians. If they are microscopic organisms that feed on the Force we would expect people who are powerful in the Force will have lots of midichlorians, which is canon.

Further evidence could be gathered by drawing blood from someone with a low midichlorian count and putting some blood near one of those Sith amulets. If after some time the blood near the amulet has more midichlorians than the blood that was kept away from the amulet as a control, that's evidence that midichlorians eat Force.

If the midichlorians don't react to the amulet, then maybe midiclorians are the source of the Force and the amulet is made of concentrated midichlorian poop or something like that.

*** And if midichlorians eat force, but the power levels of Jedi and Sith do not decrease with age, then the force is constantly replenished or generated in force-sensitives. Disovery of a means to immunize oneself against midichlorians will either result in an increasingly powerful force-sensitive, who perhaps gains power exponentially as time passes, or merely a force-sensitive who is still more powerful than others, if only because their force is able to reach its baseline.

I think the former case the more persuasive, as to have a baseline level of force power at all wouldn't be evolutionarily necessary when midichlorians serve the role of limiters. This might also suggest unpredicable outcomes in having unlimited force.

And why do Midi-chlorians have to be parasites? Maybe they're neither harmful nor useful, or maybe they're symbiotic. Maybe they're a beneficial change or mutation in the mitochondria that happens due to high Force exposure over long time spans, and that gives a Force user super mitochondria that work better than normal and allow a force user to eat less and exert themselves longer without wearing out, and can also be used to measure Force power in an individual by seeing what percentage of their mitochondria have changed to super Force powered "Midi-chlorian" mitochondria.
