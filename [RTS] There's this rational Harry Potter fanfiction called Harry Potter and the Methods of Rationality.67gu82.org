I guess the reason we write similarly is because of our browsing habits...? I mean, if we're influenced by the same things, then it could impact our writing style.

The funny thing is that the Harry Potter fanfic community really dislikes it. Well, some of them like it, but there seems to be this resentment against HPMoR since it gets recommended so often in that subreddit, and the people there generally doesn't like it. They have some genuine and well placed criticism, some of which I agree with, and some of which I don't.

One of the criticism includes scientific mistakes or misinformation with different facts, which I tend to agree with (Although there's not just mistakes either of course). But the fic isn't really for science, it is for rationality and philosophy, and the scientific principles are still true. So I would still defend it.

I think it's a great piece of fiction, but it's not really a Harry Potter story. It's much more independent than most fanfics, and that's probably one of the reasons why [[/r/harrypotterfanfiction]] doesn't like it.

** The biggest gripe I have with that fanfiction is that Harry, every other character, and by extension Yudkowsky himself, seem to fetishize being analytically clever, to the extent that it stunts what should be normal social skills. As one person commented online a while ago, conversations between Quirrel/Malfoy/Potter tend to take the form:

#+begin_quote
  “Here is an awesome manipulation I'm using against you”

  “My, that is an effective manipulation. You are a dangerous man”

  “I know, but I also know that you are only flattering me as an attempt to manipulate me.”

  “My, what an effective use of Bayesian evidence that is!”
#+end_quote

That whole "which level are you playing at" nonsense is another example of what I'm talking about.\\
Normal people don't worry about stuff like that, trusting their fast-response social intuition instead of using their slow-response intellect to try to rationally figure out if another person is telling the truth (which isn't any more likely to be correct, and may even be worse, due to fast-response working so well with subconscious indicators).

Additionally, Harry doesn't seem to ascribe any personhood to people who aren't as smart as he is, dividing the world into PCs and NPCs, and saying things like he doesn't see any reason for Weasley to exist.

Also, [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/][this page]] in an archive of one person's excellent analysis and criticism of HPMoR, though it's missing several entries due to the original going down.

I've always found it funny how much I like some of the fiction linked in this sub, given how much I can't stand MoR.

I think the /main/ thing wrong with it is that the author is utterly convinced that everyone else is irredeemably stupid and incapable of having ideas of their own. The way he writes the "banking" system as something a fifth grader could get rich off of, and the law system as this weird Dark Ages formal aristocracy, and so on - it reeks of having zero faith in anyone else /even to act in their own self-interest/.

(This comes out in the LW Sequences as well. There's some good stuff in there - I use the blegg/rube thingy about categories a lot - but it's not easy to wade through the condescension.)

It seems like so many of the problems in the story stem from that everyone-is-sheep mentality. He diverges from canon willy-nilly because the canon isn't rational and has no value. Harry talks down to everyone and they go along with it because when God-Emperor Hariezer speaks, the sheep listen. Everyone's decisions revolve around Harry - taken to ridiculous extremes in that chapter where he successfully(!) intimidates Snape for asking him a few questions.

Like, it's a mostly-shallow nerd fantasy along the lines of Ender's Game, and I don't begrudge people for liking it (I used to like those stories myself!), but the insistence that it's so much /more/ than a shallow nerd-fantasy is annoying.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

either your criticism is accurate, in which case your opponent would have to be a literal drooling moron, or you're deliberately leaving out nuances in an attempt to mischaracterize them/make them sound stupid/inflame other people. Guess which possibility is the more likely one? (Hint: it's not the one that relies on assuming your opponent is a total drooling moron.)

Like, at this point I really have to ask: why did you write this comment? If it was to convince people who like HPMoR that they're wrong to do so, then (1) that's pretty misguided, IMO, and (2) the wording and tone you used pretty much guarantee that that's not going to happen. If it was to make an anti-recommendation against HPMoR to people who haven't read it yet, then I think you picked the wrong subreddit to comment on. But to be honest, I don't think it's either of those two reasons. I think you posted a comment lambasting HPMoR because [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][it's fun to make fun of people/things you don't like]], because you wanted to score Internet points, and (if I were being uncharitable) because you wanted to get a reaction out of people.

Is this unfair? Is this unreasonable? Maybe so. But unfair or not, everything I've written here has been an honest explication of my thoughts. I'm sorry if I sounded a bit short with you in this comment, but quite frankly, if you refer to the main character of HPMoR as "God-Emperor Hariezer", you have no grounds to complain about the tone of someone else's reply.

P.S. Note that at no point have I actually tried to defend HPMoR. I haven't done so partially because (1) I don't have the time and (2) I don't think it's particularly in need of defending, but mostly because (3) I dislike the implied contextualization, in which HPMoR fans (who I imagine constitute /a substantial majority of this subreddit/) are immediately treated as the defendants to your prosecutor, just because you wrote a comment criticizing HPMoR. I can think of no other community in which the /default response to someone coming in and blatantly strawmanning your positions/ is to treat their points as if they were somehow salient enough to be worth arguing against, and yet this appears to be exactly what happens here every single damn time somebody criticizes something we like. (Remember that SV thread about "Why rational fiction is inherently problematic" that basically blew up both there and on Reddit, people?) This is a bad thing, I don't like it, and I'm tired of it happening.

And the charitable way to rephrase /that/ is "because you want to find, and socialize with, others who have similar dislikes to your own."

Personally, I've never found that picking friends by what they /dislike/ makes for a very good filter, but some people do it.

(Though, often, vitriol is /random/---people, especially teenagers (I don't know if said poster is one) will sometimes just cast hate at random targets, just like they'll sometimes cast interest at random targets, in order to find and test-join the groups that agree with those statements, to further see whether they like being a member of said groups. They'll then then retroactively use their judgement of the value of the group membership to inform whether they should be smug, or ashamed, about what they said previously; and therefore, whether it was "true" or not.)

Neither, really; I'm just trying to offer possible motivations (from an anthropological standpoint) for observed behavior that's quite hard to see a logical motivation for.

Honestly, it probably is "bad for the community"; though I don't feel much concern for that---not so much because I don't like this community, but because this sort of thing is just, a bit, "how people are", and so communities need to deal with some amount of that. Even a zero-tolerance policy for this sort of thing doesn't help much, because it's a constant stream of /new/ people that do it, and they mostly just do it for a little while, grow up, and then regret their previous behavior.

It's like three-year-olds drawing on the walls at a daycare. Disciplining them doesn't help much; time does; but then, next year, there are new three-year-olds. It's an "eh, whaddyagunnado" thing. You sand off the walls, repaint, and move on.

***** That's what's so funny to me! He writes at length about things like how rationality is badly represented in stories, then turns around and commits a lot of the same mistakes.

How likely is it /really/ that some poor wizard family wouldn't have figured out the Gringotts arbitrage trick? Mr. Weasley, with his muggle fascination? Fred or George? If breaking the wizarding economy completely really is /that easy/, I simply cannot believe the Weasleys would stay poor. If EY thinks they would, that means they exist in the story not to pursue their own goals, but to be part of the "stupid, backwards wizarding world" backdrop that EY so desperately wants to set up.

And this is a common thing. EY goes on many, many rants (even IN MoR) about how important and hard it is to admit you're totally and entirely wrong - and yet, Hariezer himself never has to do this. He talks about how cheap it is to have "smart" characters recite long lists of facts or numbers, and yet Hariezer's primary method of communication is long-winded rants full of jargon which often have inaccurate details, and are sometimes flat-out wrong (see the physics rant from chapter 2).

I mean, I /like/ the advice EY has blogged about. I think most of it is good if you're trying to write an intelligent story for a nerd audience. That's why I wish he'd used it in MoR.

#+end_quote

Really unlikely. However, spoiler alert:

Harry notices late in the story that Voldemort fails to imagine /nice/ ways of accomplishing his goals. It's a cognitive blind spot.

Harry has some of those, too. One of them is that, having noticed that his situation is unusual (being a scientific wizard), he tends to believe that he is /the first/ to be in this situation; that he always gets first mover advantages. He persists in acting this way even after being given the diary of Roger Bacon, a scientific wizard who lived hundreds of years ago.

(Entry 1723 in Bacon's diary: "Tried the arbitrage thing. Goblins showed up with glowing knives. Won't be doing that again.")

The story doesn't support the idea that Harry actually /does/ always get first mover advantages. He pretty much gets /one/: partial Transfiguration. But it very much supports the idea that Harry /erroneously believes/ that he will always get them.

(Entry 413 in Bacon's diary: "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME.")

And Harry is /incurious/ about his forebears. He makes no attempt to read Bacon's diary.

Harry lost his time-turner because he was abusing it. Later on he gets it back because he could have averted a tragedy if only he'd had it, and he verbally browbeats an authority figure into giving it back to him.

Harry sneaks gold into his pouch, something that was against the established limits, then it turns out that McGonagall should have let him do so all along.

McGonagall starts out as a strict authoritarian, but by the end of the story she learns her lesson and goes along with the corrections Harry gives her in front of the entire school.

Harry ignores the rules against experimenting with transfiguration to no negative repercussions except Hermione chewing him out, which he doesn't really take to heart, and he's ultimately justified in doing so because he learned partial transfiguration out of the deal.
