Welcome to the monthly thread for recommendations, which is posted on the fifth day of every month.

Feel free to recommend any books, movies, live-action TV shows, anime series, video games, fanfiction stories, blog posts, podcasts, or anything else that you think members of this subreddit would enjoy, whether those works are rational or not. Also, please consider including a few lines with the reasons for your recommendation.

Alternatively, you may /request/ recommendations, in the style of [[http://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6rjai2][the weekly recommendation-request thread of r/books]].

** [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/threadbare-original-litrpg.43430/][Threadbare]] is a story in progress on Sufficient Velocity.

The protagonist is a recently animated teddy bear, the setting is an original RPG-mechanics deathworld and the story is being written by the author of the [[https://www.amazon.com/Dire-Saga-Season-One-ebook/dp/B01N53O0W7/ref=sr_1_7?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1512489685&sr=1-7][Dire Saga]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.4351/][Dire Worm]].

It is not rationalist, though I am fairly certain that it qualifies as rational per the side-bar. It has frequent moments of tension, but the focus is on humor. It is well written and up to this point avoids most, maybe even all, of the clichés that make most LitRPGs such unreadable messes.

All in all I strongly recommend this for all lovers of light entertainment with serious undertones, especially since it updates every 1-2 days.

*** I have read the Dire series, and agree with the commendation. It has elements that perhaps don't fully conform with rational(oat) thought, but overall pretty good. Just read through Threadbare based on this rec. A very enjoyable read, taking a comedic approach to a fairly standard world-theme.

Definitely agree with the recommendation.

#+begin_quote
  A young man dies, and a grim reaper offers to revive him in exchange for servitude. Responsibilities include saving other people's lives and occasionally fighting unspeakable horrors. But this particular young man is cripplingly shy. No, seriously. He can barely even speak to people. It's really bad.
#+end_quote

It checks all the boxes of rational fiction. Superpowers are based of things like the periodic table of elements and successful applications of powers require knowledge about chemistry, physics, biology etc. You can't just materialize a working trebuchet if you don't how one is made. Factions are more nuanced then they appear on the surface. Acknowledgement that problems aren't so simple that they can be solved by beating people up. I find the whole thing to be a lot of fun. It has short updates daily.

*Podcast recommendations*

Excluding partisan political commentary podcasts and podcasts mentioned by other people already:

- 99% Invisible
- The AskHistorians Podcast - official podcast of [[/r/AskHistorians]]
- Backstory - they take things currently in the news and spend an hour talking about, um, the historical backstory.
- British History Podcast - what it says on the tin
- Dan Carlin's Hardcore History - 3-5 hour long episodes on history; sounds longer but is even longer when you realize that each episode is usually part of a miniseries (e.g. WWI took ~15 hours IIRC)
- Escape Pod, Podcastle, & Pseudopod - audio short stories (scifi, fantasy, horror respectively)
- FiveThirtyEight Poltiics - political commentary, but I wouldn't call them partisan
- Freakonomics - explores topics as varied as "How do we stop terrorism?" and "Why are there so many mattress outlets, when people don't buy mattresses very often?"
- Harry Potter and the Sacred Text - a chapter-a-week reading of the Harry Potter series that approaches it like a Bible Study, with the assumption that there are no mistakes and that you can find a valuable lesson in even randomly-selected passages. there are some genuinely interesting discussions, and I also appreciate the demonstration that you can find (or rather make) deep meaning in anything if you look hard enough.
- The History of English - history of the English language
- The History of Rome - what it says on the tin
- Foodstuff - the history of rice, butter, forks, etc.
- Intelligence Squared - one-hour debates on various topics. it's gotten me to shift my views a couple of times.
- Lawfare Podcast - a lot of current events / politics stuff like "Mass surveillance after Snowden", plus some historical context stuff like the Holodomor / Ukrainian famine and how that might be influencing how Putin is dealing with Ukraine
- The Partially Examined Life - philosophy podcast
- Philosophize This! - likewise
- Planet Money - stuff like the conflict between Walmart and Amazon, and how cows helped to stabilize some aspects of the economy of South Sudan (until they didn't, which is also part of the story)
- Radiolab - a lot of random things, from CRISPR to 4chan
- Safe for Democracy - history of U.S. foreign relations from WWII to the present day, brought to you by a crapload of coups
- Stuff You Missed in History Class - odds and ends from history
- TED Radio Hour - TED talks, on audio!
- TED Talks Daily - more TED talks, still on audio!
- Very Bad Wizards - more philosophy
- Waking Up with Sam Harris - philosophy and other odds and ends, kind of a New Atheist's Rationally Speaking, though that might not be a good description because you don't have to be a New Atheist to enjoy it (at least, I'm not)
- You Are Not So Smart - cognitive biases and suchlike
- War College - like Lawfare, but more military-focused
- What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law - a little bit partisan, I guess, but the focus is on constitutional law, even if it's usually through the lens of "Here's how Trump is skirting dangerously close to, or over, the line today"

*** I'd like to second [[/u/trekie140][u/trekie140]] 's recommendation for The Mixed Six. They do a great job of fun, and generally lighthearted conversation and it's one of the few things I'm a patreon for. Some of the guys from that also do RPPR which is my favorite actual play tabletop RPG podcast although the sound quality can be really really hit or miss. I'd recommend starting with the recent "Somewhere Lane".

Some other podcasts/not quite podcasts I'd recommend:

- Wait wait don't tell me

- The Good Friends of Jackson Elias

- Writing Excuses

- Daly Planet Films

- Fresh Air

I've tried to get into the Adventure zone a few times but never make it very far. Can someone make a case for it? Early on, at least, they seem to break from story/roleplaying a bit too often.

Or anyone else have good tabletop RPG podcasts?

**** I can make a strong case for the Adventure Zone. The first few episodes, the McElroys are certainly caught up in their own humor, but by the third arc (not counting interludes) they begin to really explore deeper themes of power/corruption. I wouldn't ever call it rational, except that Griffin is pretty good about letting plausible things happen and not giving anyone, even the villains, plot armor. Later parts of the series feature aspects that we would recognize from rational fiction, including competent protagonists, competent villains, multi verses, and time loops.

Might I recommend listening to MBMBAM first? You may enjoy the early, jokey episodes more if you are already inoculated with McElroy style humor.

**** I've listened to untold hours of RPPR and will forever be thankful for it leading me to so many things I loved, Caleb Stokes in particular with his work on Red Markets and The Mixed Six, but I have a hard time recommending it over other rpg podcasts like One Shot or The Adventure Zone.

RPPR is definitely a good example of how to play and run a rpg, but I can't say that's as entertaining to listen to as when professional improv comedians play. Their games also lean /a bit/ more on the simulationist side, whereas I'm a hardcore narrativist. I've never liked listening to the combat scenes.

I got into the show as time filler and it definitely served it's purpose as that, going above and beyond more than a few times, but for me it's become a less reliable source of entertainment as of late. I'm just not enough of a junkie for actual plays anymore, I want an engrossing story and compelling characters.

** Looking for recommendations for Youtube channels: no specific focus, so long as they are good at what they do instead of being "just another x channel". Some ones I like:

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube/featured][Lindsay Ellis]] does long form video essays about film criticism, focusing on narrative structure and how a story accomplishes its goals (or doesn't).

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/BrutalMovieReview/featured][Nyx Fears]] is like Lindsay Ellis, but he tends to focus on horror in particulary.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints/featured][Contrapoints]] is a youtuber that talks about political issues that are at least adjacent to social justice. She's funny as hell and has buckets of style.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjdQaSJCYS4o2eG93MvIwqg][Killian Experience]] makes funny parodies of video game strategy guides and retrospectives.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/JennyENicholson/feed][Jenny Nicholson]] has very casually presented videos with razor sharp wit. Most of her stuff is about Star Wars and superheroes.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt/featured][Kurzgesagt]]. Think CGP Grey with excellent animation.

[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT6duuVl_8qxJ5eaaPHRX_ij][Monster Factory]] is a playlist on the Polygon channel where two brothers make deliberately ugly characters in video games with character creation. Sounds simple, but it's one of the few channels to actually make me laugh so hard I was crying.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart][Vihart]] makes very nerdy math videos that play around with concepts and explain them with fun animations.

[[https://www.youtube.com/user/RedEyesTakeWarning][Overly Sarcastic Productions]] has fun and detailed videos about history, literature and tropes. My favourite are the videos about ancient legends, presented for a modern audience. You'll probably find yourself stopping quite often to have time to read all the little comments included in each picture.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g][Isaac Arthur]] has videos on science and futurism, treated in a realistic and detailed way while still keeping things accessible. I've learned about fun things like Orbital Rings from there, which basically are superstructures that put space elevators to shame and are what you'd use in case you want to turn the surface of Jupiter into living space.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClMJgjg2z_IrRm6J9KrhcuQ][Goodnight Moon]] creates vivid and detailed Fantasy ASMR. It's mesmerising to see a fantasy world that mostly just seems nice and cozy rather than the usual world-ending threats to people have to face in epic stories. If you like ASMR, this is the best I know of, and if you don't it's still worth watching because the worldbuilding is just so good.

[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-to_wlckb-bFDtQfUZL3Kw][Door Monster]] makes excellent comedy, often about games. Their Civ series is fun and even remotely connected, they've recently made a few videos on DnD, and so much more that I can't mention them all because this post would be too long.

And finally, if you want something brilliant yet utterly bizarre to watch, I give you [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDr8HZvJ_30&list=PLvDhAfvgg98MuP1B_Ib3InFXjWH5-B0tX][Kotoura-san Abridged]]. It's... something else. The original anime is the heart-wrenching tale of a young girl who is very depressed partly because she can read minds but really because her parents were terrible. Before they left her all alone. And then she finds friends at school, but depression isn't just easily overcome, and overshadows those new friendships. The abridged series is also all of that but somehow manages to be hilarious at the same time.

On the other hand, I read about 85% of [[https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01][Dream Drive]] and can't really recommend it. My main issues with Dream Drive are:

- It features Christian religion, world-view, and mythology too strongly for my liking.
- The story runs on fate and co-incidences are strongly in the service of having a (relatively predictable) plot
- Characters take some quite dumb courses of action in interest of the plot and fail to jump to fairly obvious conclusions (and conversely, unobvious conclusions are sometimes drawn from insufficient evidence)
- Some difficulty suspending disbelief regarding the way the author portraits sci-fi tech and things like 'hacking'. There's also some inconsistency in the way the magic works.
- It feels like the author had some general idea of what to write, but meandered into side-characters and side plots in the middle chapters, failing to fully maintain pacing and realize the initial ideas (or the classical litRPG trope).

That said, I did stick with it almost to the end. It's easy to read and the world building / magic has a few interesting ideas (although it's leaning heavily on familiar cultures and tropes).

I wasn't really familiar with either of those going into it and still enjoyed it immensely. Sadly it looks like it was discontinued a few years ago, right before what promised to be a really good action-packed part.

If you're looking for stuff besides fan fiction, I'm a bit surprised [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]] isn't on your list. It's a really good one about a world where Good and Evil are actual god-infused concepts and certain people earn archetypal Names imbued with power over other mortals. It's frequently talked about on this sub and has two updates a week (may bump up to three if it gets enough funding).

I also really enjoy [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][The Gods Are Bastards]], but it seems to get a mixed reception here. It's also on its 13th book, so... yeah, it'll keep you busy. It's hard to capture the full scope of the story, but it's more-or-less a high fantasy western. It has a frankly ludicrous number of characters but primarily focuses on two groups: a freshman class at a university run by an elven archmage, and a number of individuals involved in plots and politics surrounding a bishop who represents the cult of the god of thieves.

I'm not particularly asking if it's rational (though that would be good information too) but whether you think it's entertaining enough to be worth your time.

***** You can watch enough to understand most available fanworks in a single day. The early seasons are /really/ short. I think The Games We Play and Professor Arc are worth the watch of the first two, at least.

That said, RWBY really isn't good, it's carried entirely on fight choreography and recognizable character archetypes, and the first started getting increasingly cheaper after the original creator died.

***** I've enjoyed it; it feels a bit rough (especially animation-wise) in the early seasons, and there's a fair amount of episodes where the focus is on the fights and not any story movement. But as the series goes on both the story and the animation get better. The world-building is neat too. It's not the most amazing series ever, but it's worth a watch if you want something to binge-watch for a few nights.

If you're gonna read the RWBY fan fiction it helps to have some context for who the characters are. It's not strictly needed, but (for example) I read The Games We Play before I had watched the series, and it kinda-sorta spoiled some of the characters who show up in later seasons. It's also neat to have a baseline for what the story /actually/ is and then seeing how authors change it up in fanfics.

***** The animation and story have struggled since the original creator passed away. Definitely has its issues (annoyingly whiny characters, persistent willful arrogance and irrational behavior), but it's better than most anime's I've seen. (Though RWBY technically isn't anime.)

Not that that necessarily means much. I usually don't like anime.

It's not rationalist, but is rational. Character motivations are consistent with their roles/cultural contexts. Events have that feeling of "plausibility", where it seems like consequences logically proceed from the situations that lead up to them.

** I've been playing a lot of the new version of Dominions which came out about a week ago: [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/722060/Dominions_5__Warriors_of_the_Faith/][Dominions 5, Warriors of the Faith]]. The TL;DR: The Dwarf Fortress of Turn Based Strategy multiplayer videogames.

Illwinter, the makers, are a small indie team of two people making games as a hobby. The focus is very much on depth, variety, detail, and amount of content, while UI, graphics, and accessibility are not really at all the focus. The Dominions series is basically the same game at it's core, but every few years they do a huge rewrite on multiple elements of the game and break e.g. modding, map, and savegame compatibility and release it as a new game, but keeping most of the previous game's content; in between major releases, they support the game with additional content, balancing, and bug fixes for free. If you absolutely hated Dominions 3 or 4, this version will probably not change your view. If you've been enjoying the series, like me, then this version is a welcome addition that brings a lot of new elements, including a more real-time approach to modelling combat, a new system for recruiting commanders, a completely redone and vastly more interesting and versatile set of Bless effects to empower sacred units, and a somewhat improved UI.

The game's core conceit is that there is a fantasy world full of giants, lavamen, lizardmen, humans, oni, undead, demons, ogres, fishmen of several flavours, etc. Some time in the ancient past, the Pantokrator, chief god, became the most powerful god and ruled the world. Now the previous Pantokrator has disappeared and the most powerful beings in the world are duking it out to become the new chief god. You play as a Pretender God ruling a nation of believers, and try to conquer the world.

The game draws on many real life and fictional mythologies (Norse, Judaic, Christian, Egyptian, Chinese, Japanese, Hindu, Greek, Zoroastrian, Conan, Lovecraft, etc.) for the various nations to play as; there are three different ages to play in, each with 20-30 different nations to play as, some of which represent the same nation over time growing, decaying, changing, etc. In the game, you can cast spells that range in scale from summoning Water Elementals and casting fireballs, to summoning mad undead pretender gods from the pits of Tartarus, putting out the Sun, or sacrificing hundreds of slaves to attract the attention of horrors from beyond the stars (basically Earthdawn Horrors).

The game is turn based; every turn, you get to see the state of the world as far as you can tell from scouts, diplomacy, armies, etc, and then you order your mages, priests, commanders, spies, and armies where to go, what to do in fights, what spells to research and cast, and so forth. Then after all players have played this turn, all the combat and conflict and so forth is resolved simultaneously with the armies and generals and mages all obeying your orders for battle plans, and you can watch all the combat results from that happening, and see your armies crush your enemies (or be crushed, of course). The game keeps track of every soldier and models wounds, morale, etc. in granular detail. In multiplayer games, many games are played at a rate of 24 or 36 or 48 hours per turn - so that you can play out your turn whenever and then it will all be centrally processed. A typical turn might take a couple minutes for a player to play at the start of the game, but by the end it can be quite intense at an hour or more, depending on how much you want to micromanage. The game focuses heavily on combat and war, and abstracts away almost all base-building concerns.

The biggest problems with the game are the graphics (sprites that are easy to mod in more of but are otherwise not great) and that the enemy AI is not sophisticated so the multiplayer scene is the best place to play the game. The greatest strengths are the game's insane depth and replayability - I have spent over 700 hours on Steam on Dominions 4 without getting bored, and all signs point in that direction for Dominions 5 as well.

Dominions games often go on sale for up to ~80% off, after they've been out for some time, so if you're not willing to pay full price it may still be worth adding to a wishlist for the inevitable Steam sales.

** [[https://www.amazon.com/Lady-Awakened-Blackshear-Family-Book-ebook/dp/B0053CTN1W][A Lady Awakened]] is a romance novel with refreshingly practical characters.

The plot starts when Martha Russell is widowed. Her husband's estate will pass to his male next-of-kin, in this case, and abusive brother.

To protect the people on her estate, she hatches a plan. If she's able to conceive in the next month, English law will recognize the kid as her dead husband's heir. So, she makes a contract with an irresponsible and disliked neighbor.

The book was interesting in how it inverted the normal tempo of a romance novel. There's no "will they or won't they." They do. It's not especially good for either of them. But he has a contract.

So, instead of that back-and-forth, the characters end up bonding over debates about farming policy and the economics of running an English country estate. I think the book will be interesting for people who want Level 1 intelligent characters in an unusual genre.

"Malinalli is an ancient being adrift in a world that has forgotten her -- our own world, in the form of Providence, Rhode Island, 2014. Whiling away the days *until the inevitable time when the veil of secrecy surrounding the supernatural is torn apart and mythical creatures from every culture are revealed to humanity*, Mali is against her will thrust into an investigation that could very well make that new reality come sooner than anyone wishes. Thankfully, she is one of the few people with the knowledge necessary to hunt down a very special killer."

Emphasis mine.

As much as urban fantasy isn't what I'd usually consume, I'd highly reccomend this work. It's not rational per se, but characters is very much driven by internal motivations rather than plot demands, and it has some incredibly interesting worldbuilding. Plus, the main character is very sympathetic, which helps.

Also, this story is actually complete, but just being posted chapter by chapter, so there's no worries about the author abandoning the project.

The premise is that a bunch of the Ranma cast get exalted and transported into creation and then violence happens. It's an enjoyable action heavy fic that so far is rational, but not rationalist.

I think people should definitely give it a try if you've really liked Ranma fics before, or if you really want to see more good Exalted stories.

** Not something I wholeheartedly recommend, but a story that still tickled quite a few of my preferences was Robert J. Sawyer's Quintaglio trilogy. While the books have connecting themes and characters, they /can/ be read on their own.

Basic premise: Copernican revolution in world with sentient dinosaurs (relatives of velociraptors, I think).

There's more to it, of course, and the world building is well done in my opinion, with a lot of though put into the society how a predatory dinosaur species could develop culture and how this would express itself.
