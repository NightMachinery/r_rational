In this chapter, I abandon all remaining pretenses of writing fantasy. I don't usually like to post my stuff two times in a row, but I thought I would make a single exception in this instance.

Thanks as always for reading!

(Sorry if this popped up twice; I goofed on the first attempt at submission.)

I'm curious what you meant by this ... I didn't feel like the genre, setting, or direction of the story changed noticeably in this chapter? (If anything, it was the interlude a few chapters ago that suggests some weird meta genre-twist weirdness.)

Anyway, stuff is moving along.

Since Ophelia had the stronger reaction (probably meaning she recognized Balthazar's form more than he recognized hers), and given some of Kam's dialogue, it suggests Ophelia was the one with greater distinction treatment from her original form.

This chapter also isn't the first one where issues of gender have come up, there was all the discomfort with having the entrances segregated by gender for example. I'm wondering if it might be connected somehow: we know that the aetherbridge does a prosognostic overlap check, so if Ophelia and Balthazar had been on the same trip, the overlap would have been noticed sooner. This was 'conveniently' avoided, although I don't think it's been specified when Balthazar arrived, so the gendered entrance thing might be narratively unrelated. I'm just looking for anything that might be a clue, and this is all I've grabbed onto so far.

I was mostly goofing around, but I guess I was referring to the barrage of pseudo-sci fi concepts at the start of the chapter. Speaking more seriously, though, it's obviously still very much a fantasy story in a lot of its devices and its respect for actual science, just with a bit of cross-genre stuff thrown in.

**** heh, well, mixing in science just doesn't register as 'not fantasy' for me these days.

still really liking this work, keep it up!

** The setting is fascinating. For a while I though that Iron and Ironworkers are just metaphors for technology and the characters just live in a virtual reality, no actual magic involved. And there are so many parallels to that scenario in this explanation. Substrate, computers not been able to emulate themselves, string theory, mass warping space. But they seem too sophisticated a society to not understand their situation, and I like the whole weird magic setting more, I think.

How does seed checking work in practice, though? Surely restaurant staff don't check every person's seed as they enter by hand? That would be a recipe for disaster long term. Would be safer to just wear masks everywhere. Do they use ID cards? Can logic engines check the seed at the entrance automatically? But then why would you need paperwork here.

*** I'm glad you like the setting! I really appreciate these kind of comments.

I don't want to say too much, but when I was first outlining the story, I was thinking about how a lot of modern fantasy settings are fundamentally written as tragedies about the loss of past knowledge, with the implication that if it had been preserved, everything would have been okay - Library of Alexandria parables. I was partly drawn to create the setting by how I find those conceptually frustrating. I wanted a post-apocalypse where knowledge is kept, and instead the emphasis is on its inability, even at its apex, to save humans completely from both themselves and the reality of the universe.

The primary thing I tried to do with the worldbuilding was to create a certain tense strangeness by meshing together a combination of both ancient and futuristic imagery, language and metaphysics, to the point that things become difficult to distinguish as belonging to one or the other. A lot of the story is about generational conflict or the pursuit of recapturing something lost or fading away, and I wanted that dissonance between old and new to be palpable to the reader. To make them feel a sort of grief? I'm not sure if that will make sense.

There was originally a little section that explained this way back in chapter 4, but I had to remove it because it was too awkward and jarring with the level of context readers had that that point.

Basically, though: Older places without much importance of wealth use a system where someone enters the number at the door before it unlocks, while newer ones have a logic bridge that checks instead. The order using paperwork for it is another of its really antiquated traditions.
