Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Is anyone interested in doing a read through of any particular story?

I was going back over /Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid/ because of a deleted post earlier today and realized that while I hadn't managed to finish the last four chapters, it still was an amazing activity to do with this subreddit and I would love to do it again.

So any recommendations?

I worry that no strong consensus would emerge if we allow for different mediums. It might already be difficult enough to have the community agree on a book to read.

** When compared to the general populous, the rational community appears to be better informed about mental techniques and pitfalls. However this does not seem to have meaningfully impacted, the behaviour of people who identify as a part of the /rational/ community (myself included) [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/n4e/why_cfars_mission/][[1]]]. In other words, we do not seem to be applying what we know, to the real world.

To examine this hypothesis, I would like to gather some data. As it's hard to measure the impact of something abstract -- e.g. [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][The Sequences]] -- I'll attempt to ask more objective questions. It would be awesome if you could reply in the comments with your response.

4. What made/would-make you use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]] technique (e.g. organic chemistry course, inability to remember people's names)?

Q3 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic][Nootropics]]:

*** In my personal experience, the limiting factor for success is not usually things like ability to recognize cognitive biases, or knowledgeability about options--at least, not for someone in my position. I have been, and always will be, limited by willpower, drive, grit, resolve, or whatever you call it. When I start to do something or try to learn something or get something done, I'm usually already capable of accomplishing the task. Gaining more knowledge or tools doesn't help, unless they are explicitly aimed at increasing willpower or solving certain problems. Rationality never helped me improve my career prospects, become productive, or sleep better, because knowledge of what to do was never a limiting factor.

Some people may have lots of willpower, or may not understand where it needs to be applied, but my low-hanging fruits are different. My problems are always solved by setting rules for myself.

One of the low-hanging fruits I've been dealing with, for example, is getting 8 hours of sleep per night. Up until the past year or so, I usually got 6 hours of sleep per night, sometimes fewer. I was tired and less productive. My lack of sleep was not due to physiological insomnia, but the fact that I would excitedly stay up late every night reading or playing games. If I actually got in bed, I fell right asleep, even at normal hours. So, I started making rules for myself about when I was allowed to stay up late, building my discipline and self-control. Now I sleep well, and am much more productive in all aspects of my life. This is a great victory for my willpower, and did not use rationality.

Another example was dieting. I always wanted to lose weight, and one good way to do this is to cultivate a healthier lifestyle. I wanted to replace calorically dense, unfulfilling snacks like potato chips and candy bars with hearty, lower-calorie sneaks like nuts, beef jerky, apples. I wanted to stop eating large snacks after dinner, because I was rarely hungry and these added a lot of calories, etc. Sounds good, right? And yet, there was a problem: I lacked the willpower to diet. Instead, I decided to keep a meticulous food diary. This would let me track what I eat and hopefully motivate me to diet more. Sounds good, right? And yet, there was a problem: I lacked the willpower to meticulously look up and weigh all my food, especially on-the-spot. Instead, I decided to photograph literally everything I ate, and write it down at the end of the day, which is much easier. This let me keep a food diary without small inconveniences throughout the day. After keeping the food diary for about a month, I became motivated to diet seriously, and managed to make a healthy and sustainable adjustment to how I eat, resulting in a health improvements. I'm pretty proud of this, and this once again was something I always wanted to do, and always knew how to do, but lacked the will to pull off.

So, questions!

- Q1 Spaced Repetition

  - 1 - Yes
  - 2 - Yes, for about 4 years.
  - 3 - Technology and computer networking
  - 4 - I wanted to increase my skills and knowledge for the job I had at the time.

- Q2 Method of Loci

  - 1 - Yes
  - 2 - No, No.
  - 3 - N/A
  - 4 - If I had to learn new things for my career, or perhaps for a particular event or responsibility, and my particular mixture of mnemonics and spaced repetition was not successful.

- Q3 Nootropics

  - 1 - Yes
  - 2 - Yes, if you count Caffeine. I usually drink two cups of coffee per day. I've been drinking coffee at this rate for 8 years.
  - 3 - Caffeine makes me feel more alert and awake. I would consider using other nootropics if I felt like I desperately needed to increase productivity and my normal methods were ineffective.

*** In addition to how hard it is to detect bias, I think its also a matter of drive and discipline. In my case for example, I'm a huge fan of self improvement and constantly read about new strategies and techniques to improve my thinking and performance.

Problem is that I lack the discipline to maintain it for long periods of time and I tend to enter long periods where I just can't focus or get things done effectively. Currently I'm under one of those periods where even waking up becomes a chore and I'm in pain and tired most of the day, particularly when I try to focus and get something done. I still haven't figured how to overcome it but nootropics do help a bit.

* Q1 - Spaced Repetition:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: q1---spaced-repetition
  :END:
Yes. I'm currently using Anki for language learning and I'm trying to figure how to move it towards applications in my career (engineering). I use it daily, for about an hour at a time and also make use of repetition exercises but those tend to take 1 to 4 hours due to how tiring they are (particularly in this state).

About topic, currently its Japanese but planning to use it for Control and Ai concepts and formula.

* Q2 - Method of Loci:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: q2---method-of-loci
  :END:
No. Read about it, tried it a bit and built a small framework for myself with personal data. So far I've found it expensive because I'm highly linguistic/auditory and have more trouble remembering visual input and thus haven't been able to justify the time invested trying to create it.

I plan to attempt again once I've managed to put my long due tasks in order.

* Q3 - Nootropics
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: q3---nootropics
  :END:
Yes. Currently I take Adrafinil to help me focus and improve my mood. It helps me work for a bit of time although I found it fairly expensive and don't want to become dependent on it to work.

In addition I take:

- Caffeine. My main drug of choice, currently taking 3 cups per day although I'm not managing to stay awake anyway. I usually go through cool down periods where I don't take any coffee to recover.
- Green tea. Due to the L-theine and its a good complement with coffee.
- Monohydrated creatine. I'm trying to gain weight although it hasn't worked that much. I still miss my meals due to being asleep and probably require more food consumption than chemicals.
- Vitamin E. I'm 24 years old and showing signs of age.

I've also thought of consuming resveratrol and check anti aging supplements but with a student budget its not easy.

* Additional techniques
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: additional-techniques
  :END:
In addition I'm trying *meditation* and it works well at keeping my anxiety and headaches in check but the effects have been temporary at best.

Currently I'm reading *Brain Rules* by John Medina and checking how can I improve my thinking. Can't recommend the book as most of the advice is quite obvious.

And I checked *mnemonics* which seem to be another technique that adjusts well with my auditory/linguistic framework. They are also time consuming but not as much as the method of Loci so I'm thinking of proceeding with those once I'm more free.

What I find most important right now is to build willpower and discipline so that I can overcome whatever it is I have.

Also I'm trying to lessen my time on Reddit as I turned it into my escape from the pain without noticing. I spend too much time reading and too little doing (along with dreaming, it doesn't hurt when I'm asleep) and its hurting me a lot on the real life. I tend to become addicted to stuff like that to escape the pain and I'd welcome any advice on how to develop discipline and willpower.

1. Yup, I use it ~2x a week for geography, health care polcy, and random stuff I'm interested in that ranges from philosophy to cognitive science to anecdotes of famous people. I was tired of having a memory that wasn't great. I've always been intelligent but forgetful and I wanted to fix the latter.

2. I've used the 'linking' mnemonic to memorize all 45 US presidents and a couple of random lists of objects to impress people. This mnemonic involves turning the object into a memorable image that links to the image/mnemonic before it. For example, G Washington with a great big wig becomes a man of clay (John Adams) who tills the land (Jefferson, because he loved farmers), who digs up a friend of mine named Madison, whose head turns into a globe that reminds me o the Munroe doctrine. Goofy stuff, easy to remember, but it does have to be walked through or recalled semi frequently. I had trouble remembering it right now after 3 months of not thinking about it, but I could refresh that memory pretty easily with ~15 minutes of rehearsal. I can easily memorize a 20 or 40 item list in 120 seconds, and recall it for a while (an hour, without further rehearsal, probably), which is very occasionally useful.

3. Yup, I've heard about them since senior year of college. I occasionally take caffeine + l-theanine, rarely take l-theanine for anxiety (which is rare), supplemented Bacopa for ~5 months, very occasionally use nicotine gum to stay awake or party, and I've used microdoses of LSD a couple of times. Not sure if the last one counts, but I enjoyed it quite a bit with few side effects, so I'll include it. I use nootropics mostly for my energy levels, which are low. I've never felt too stupid for something...I've often felt too lazy for something.

I suggest meditation to anyone looking for an interesting and potentially beneficial practice. I've entered interesting states of mind with it, have been able to cultivate an emotional distance from certain painful things, and have generally felt like a better person while meditation regularly.

3. Math, languages, geography, history, random trivia, IT, lyrics/poems, pieces of code, ...
4. Interest in language learning

*Q2*

1. Yes
2. Yes, I've been using it for about 10 years. Not sure how to answer the "how regularly" part, that would need specification if you mean "going through a journey", "creating a new journey" or "having some sort of journey in your memory". Daily-ish for first option, about monthly for second, constantly for third.
3. Telephone numbers, school stuff, languages, random numbers for fun (with the usage of Dominic system)
4. I learnt this method to make up for my poor memory + had an interest in effective learning

*Q3*

1. Yes
2. No, I tried piracetam and thought it didn't help + got scared a bit
3. If I was sure there is nootropics that is fairly safe + doesn't make me develop addiction + doesn't screw with my already frail brain in some way

Why I think I'm not as rational in my life as I'd like to be: lack of knowledge (there is probably tons of hacks or more effective ways of doing things I don't do because I don't know that I should search for them), inadequacy of my body/brain, lack of willpower. IMO [[/u/blazinghand]] hit the nail on head with their comment. I like [[/r/getdisciplined]] and [[/r/meditation]], these subs help with the discipline/willpower problem a lot.

*** I've used spaced repetition, though without any software, for undergraduate anatomy and physiology. I found it useful, but did not adapt it as a general study technique because I've found that for my major coursework (Computer Science) I can easily do acceptably well on tests just by attending class and completing all projects.

I've never had any success with the method of loci, but I might consider making another attempt at it if had information that I felt was worth that much investment in effort to memorize.

I'm disinclined towards regularly taking any drugs, I don't even have a caffeine habit. I would strongly consider taking nootropics if they had more strongly established dosages/benefits/long term effects, or if they had significant adoption over a multi-year term with no side effects. At this point, I don't feel the effort of acquiring them is worth the benefit of their use, but that point could change at any time.

*** 1. Yes, I am familiar with the principle of spaced repetition. No I don't use it, as I am not a student and my job doesn't require a lot of memorization so I don't see any domain in my life that I need it for.

2. I hadn't heard of the phrase "Method of Loci" before, but (after clicking the link) it turns out I am familiar with it, but under the name "Memory Palace." I don't use it, as I am quite far at the low end of the phantasia/aphantasia scale, so using visual imagery to help recall factual information has alway seemed a little backwards to me. (Indeed, I am much more likely to use factual information to help me generate visual imagery!)

3. I have heard of nootropics. I do not currently take any, nor have I ever except for a ~2-week sample prescription for Adderall that I tried out at the suggestion of my physician several years ago. I am relatively unconvinced that the man-made category of "nootropics" necessarily carves nature at the joints, so I have no opinion on nootropics taken /en bloc/; my interest in any particular drug would have to be determined individually. (Though my experience with the Adderall makes me generally risk-averse on the subject.) It would take a substantial amount of time and diligence to do the necessary research for myself, and I haven't had the inclination to make that investment. If you asked me today, I would be most likely to try modafinil over anything else.

*** I have no strong opinion on whether TGWP is considered rational or not. If we go by the sidebar, I feel like the ultimate conflict and it's resolution had a lot of "the plot requires it" and "being good and evil rather than intelligent reasons", while there were a lot of things in the story before that point which did not have these issues. As far as having an intelligent protagonist goes... Jaune didn't do anything particularly egregiously stupid, but it never felt as if he was amazingly brilliant or whatever either - having a high number down next to "intelligence" is not the same as demonstrating intelligence in the story, and Jaune didn't really feel super smart to me ever.

Regardless of whether it is or is not 'rational' fiction, I wouldn't recommend the whole thing to people anyways - mostly because while the beginning up to and including the stealing of the airship was pretty strong, after that the fic ran into huge pacing issues where for a very long time none of the 'conflicts' in the story had stakes or mattered at all if the protagonist won or lost, which drained the story of tension or interest for a very long time. And then the ending felt sort of a lot like Star Ocean 2 or Star Ocean 3, in that it was extremely strange and felt very discontinuous with the rest of the plot which had come before while also trivializing everything in that plot that had come before it.

*** I'd argue the first quarter or so was pretty rational, but it definitely diverges from any sort of rational path shortly after the pandora shell incident, if not before then.

**** Great Scott! I only just got to the Pandora Shell part. Is that seriously only the first fourth of this thing!? o_O

***** It might be a little farther than that, but I gave up while it was still in progress. Tbh, I don't consider it to be worth reading past pandora shell unless you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for reading material.

*** (with mod hat on)

I think this can only be settled by a very obviously irrational story, or community discussion. So it's not considered anything yet, as the community hasn't considered it.

(hat off)

I enjoyed it but wouldn't call it rational; the plot and worldbuilding are very tightly intertwined. Characters generally gain more power, rather than smarter ways to use it. This is probably a natural consequence of the one-chapter-per-day serial - an incredible feat, but not one which promotes deep and detailed planning! My vote: not rational.

** I've been feeling anxious because I made several stupid financial mistakes even though I'm still up several hundred dollars. Is this normal for either normal people or the type of people who come here?

*** Making stupid financial mistakes is a pretty typical thing for people to do in general. My own investing is based off of an attempt to avoid trying to be clever and beat the market (since I'm not and I won't), and instead avoid mistakes and match the market.
