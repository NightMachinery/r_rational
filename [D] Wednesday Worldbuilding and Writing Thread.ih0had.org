Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing][I've developed a fictional country that utilizes many of the obscure political policies and governance structures that are talked about in the rational community.]]

It started out as an exploration of a parallel Venezuela that put its oil revenue into a sovereign wealth fund, though it's now much weirder than /just/ that.

Would like for people to point out any glaring issues, especially if it's because of specific expertise.

Yeah there are certain areas where I left things deliberately vague or I just link to other sources, for instance the specifics of the futarchy system would default to "whatever Robin Hanson endorses", because fleshing out /every single detail/ would require I be an economist myself. Generally when I make a comparative claim like a tax being "high" I mean on the high end of the distribution of wealthy nations. Since I where I haven't fleshed something out I default to assuming this Venezuela is similar to other wealthy nations, so as to error on the side of caution.

The inheritance taxes are decently high, but only as high as South Korea (and slightly more than France) and those countries seem to be doing fine (though the structure of the estate tax was designed to avoid the major issues with South Korea's estate tax). The nice thing about having the social security system double as a large part of the estate tax is that it can't be dodged, because people never have access to their principle so they can't exactly leave the country and take the money with them (even if they could access the /dividends/ from abroad).

#+end_quote

Venezuela in this timeline has a lot of advantages because almost all profits from oil (with Venezuela having the worlds biggest reserve) and other natural resources goes into the states sovereign wealth fund. Hell even in our timeline where most of that resource wealth was embezzled/wasted, Venezuela was /still/ able to support staggering government expenses up until oil prices crashed (just look at the figures for what an absurd portion of the populace were government employees). The country has also made sure to consistently run a surplus so that it has been able to benefit from the compound growth of its SWF. The very high immigration would also mean this Venezuela much, /much/ more populous than it is in our timeline, definitely exceeding Brazil.\\
The country is hardly a post-scarcity economy since none of the welfare the government provides is /unique/, and is generally provided in a much more cost effective way than what is the norm.

Below I make some comments on areas where I suspect the expenses you brought up are less significant than you think:

#+begin_quote
  Plus the government would pay for the insurance of those who couldn't afford it
#+end_quote

This should be much less costly than the single payer healthcare systems most wealthy nations have. Since the healthcare system was structure with incentives aligned so that it should be able to match the costs in many developing nations (by virtue of not experiencing the explosion in costs experienced by wealthy nations).

#+begin_quote
  A variety of free nutritious, but bland food like Soylent is provided by the government for free to anyone for personal consumption. Additionally the government subsidizes almost all rent for the poor, to ensure all housing can be high quality.
#+end_quote

Lots of nations have something like a food stamp system and this should be much cheaper because people usually will prefer normal food to something like soylent, and it's much cheaper to produce than normal food. The rent subsidizes however are absolutely a one of the governments largest expenses, making up most government welfare (though again other nations do similar things in ways which should usually be less cost effective).

#+begin_quote
  Infrastructure is one of the largest government expenditures, because while toll roads are common outside cities, other infrastructure must be publicly funded.
#+end_quote

This is also absolutely a major expense, but other less wealthy (per capita) nations like China have done this, and by structuring things like Hong Kong's MTR Venezuela should waste a lot less money.

#+begin_quote
  The country buys modern military hardware from other NATO members, but only enough to be militarily superior to its much poorer neighbors.
#+end_quote

I don't know why you would think was a major expense given their spending only what they have to. After all this is like the US spending only as much on military hardware as necessary to be militarily superior to Mexico and Canada. So the expenses here should be relatively trivial compared to the costs of the rest of the military.

#+begin_quote
  Primarily the function of the military is a public health and jobs training program.... serving good food, having nice amenities...
#+end_quote

The military is certainly a major part of the government's expenses, since it's focused on job training though some of this cost should be offset by the economic benefits it provides. The military also serve multiple functions which saves money, since its members provide the labor for many government projects (at no /additional/ ongoing cost), disaster relief, etc.

There's a reason so many highly urbanized asian countries already do this quite a lot, since creating new land near urban centers can be very profitable. So the main limit on land reclamation might actually be environmental concerns more so than cost.

A unit of currency is simply worth more in the hands of someone who needs it for what they consider basic necessities than in the hands of a collector who's gonna use it to prevent others from gaining a similar number of units in their count.

** Urban fantasy and language, let's go!

Real pulp urban fantasy (True Blood, Buffy, World of Darkness) has a few features: long-lived creatures of various human or superhuman level intelligence species (that are often at various stages of peace/war/conflict with one another) spread throughout the world. I'm calling them "supes" for short.

How would they communicate? You imagine a vampire that needs to move in human circles keeping up to date with the local human language, but what would a Sphynx do? Being clearly non-human, she's not going to have much interest in learning human languages except insomuch as she needs to communicate with other supes who know them. She'd probably speak her one native language (what would it be? /would/ she speak Ancient Egyptian, or would she speak Sphynx?) and whatever other languages she picked up.

Yes, supes have the time to learn many languages, and many would devote some portion of their time to it: but humans have the time to learn many languages, and very few anglophones speak more than one. It seems that language learning is done either from passion (so you'd have lots of supes who speak hundreds of languages they accumulated over the years with increasing velocity) or from necessity (so you'd have lots of supes who pick up and then drop languages as they gain/lose need).

So, with that background musing out the way, here's the questions I'm interested in discussing this week:

- Would supes have a lingua franca? What would it be? A constructed language? An ancient language that everyone teaches their children for the purposes of a lingua franca (kind of like Latin in the middle ages)? The native language of a species that is in power?

- What would the native language of these species /be/? I see no reason for them to speak human languages "natively", as they presumably don't have human parents (except vampires, werewolves). Why would a centaur, a siren, a sphynx, or a griffin learn to speak middle English just because they were born in the time and place of Shakespeare? But then, would these four different species have their own individual language (languageS, surely, because humans aren't monoliths who share one language)? Presumably the vocal cords of a griffin wouldn't be amenable to the same phonemes as a centaur.

- Imagine say, a centaur and a vampire meet. The vampire no doubt speaks their original human language. What does the centaur speak? How do they communicate? This is the thrust of my post, I guess: what's their lingua franca. Was the vampire expected to learn a supe language to fit in? Was the supe expected to learn a few human languages in case they need to speak to vampires? What if supes are very high status and vampires are very low status? Probably the vampire would be expected to learn the supe's language, right?

- How long do languages remain mutually intelligible? Shakespeare is barely intelligible to me (you need the usage notes), and you miss a lot of the nuance (e.g. the double meaning of "nothing", the pun with "country"). So probably 250-300 years is about right? How easily could a long-lived creature "keep up with the language"? Adults today don't understand modern slang, so I'd imagine it would be a lot of effort (i.e. it would impinge on "language learning time" for both the passionate and the non-passionate).

- I had the concept of a 400 year old siren based in Greece, who spoke Greek, but in an unholy mix of the past 400 years of vocabulary that was a bit hard to understand because, being a siren, he'd never really had need to maintain "easy communication" with the local humans - a weird, jilted, jarring style was perfectly servable when he needed to interact with local humans, and the local supes had picked up Greek for much the same reason and tended to have a similar command of 400+ years of Greek vocab and made similar mistakes. IDK why I am mentioning this, I just thought it was something that would obviously happen with supes as described above and I wanted opinions.

*** I think this depends highly on the history of the world. Assuming supes were at some point mostly public, but very rare, and now are both hidden and rare, I would think small isolated communities would form for both the species that can safely interact with humans and those that can't, and these pockets would have frequent enough interaction to be able to mostly understand their neighbor pockets but not necessarily all of them and not necessarily a distant pocket. Human interacting supes would likely be largely integrated, or maybe have an Amish style “go see the outside world and then come back” tradition, and therefore speak the local human languages natively.

If populations are low enough that communities aren't really possible, then I'd expect the life expectancies to be really extreme, and for most supes to be able to keep up with the language, even if they occasionally have to spend 10 years catching up.

*** I could imagine that across species, supes having established customs and rituals and maybe a few phrases without having a full language. After all, if different species rarely meet each other, they probably wouldn't be able to properly practice and maintain a specialized language but certain customs, like offering bread and salt to indicate hospitality, and certain commonly used phrases might be used enough to be remembered.

This could lead to some interesting scenarios. The ancient spells spoken by cultists to communicate to their sleeping god are actually just garbled commonly used phrases that were most frequently used to talk to the God back when it was awake and bothered to learn a bit of the local human language. Or the siren scenario you described, where the garbled tongue of a particularly influential and established supe become the language of a local supe community.

I would bet either the most used local human language or the most widespread would be the most common lingua franca. Maybe Latin, since it was spoken across Europe by the educated? In the modern era, in Europe and America, I could see it being split between Latin and English, as post World War II English became common enough to finally be worth learning/relearning by the supes. To go to your vampire meets centaur scenario, it depends on who is educated and how recently. The centaur might be irritated that the younger vampire hasn't learned latin, the common tongue of Europe for hundreds of years and thus the centaur muddles through with English, which it hasn't quite gotten around to mastering yet, which the French vampire went to the trouble of learning since it is so commonly used in the modern human World.

*** Ok, several points:

- In any sensible story, that at least aims at realism (True Blood and WoD come to mind) supes are rare, far fewer than humans, and mostly hide from humans trying to blend in, or keep to remote wilderness. What that means, is that effectively supes would adopt local human languages first, out of sheer necessity, because baring some very inhuman supes, most of them would be interacting with humans.

- because of the above, I believe there would be several types of "lingua franca", most notably Latin, English and Chinese, plus possibly Spanish and Russian.

- if there are any "native supe languages" those would very likely be used only between supes of the same type, as some kind of Sacred Tongue, used for formal occasions.

- long lived, humanoid supes would very likely influence human language a far bit over the centuries, just by using it. It would be likely that modern common English is the way it is partly because there are hundreds of vampires who refuse to let go of old grammar and words and keep feeding it back into common use.

- for many supes, especially Europe based, Classical Latin is likely the language of Magic, contracts, and politics. Why? Because Classical Latin is a VERY precise and meticulously developed language that has grammar and words for every possible idea, and thus allows for a very precise speech or writing. If you are a 1000 year old vampire writing a Hunting Grounds contract, or a Demon buying a soul, or a Witch casting a complex ritual spell, you want to be as precise and non ambiguous as possible.

- a lot of immortal/long lived supes woudl likely speak in two "modes": standard modern language for everyday dealings with normals, and speaking with their original accent or original language when wanting to show their age (and thus, power). So say, a 2000 year old vampire might speak with a mild Boston accent on a normal night, but make him mad enough and he would rant with a throaty Ancient Germanic accent of his warlord days.

- the more "natural" the supernatural creature is, the less likely it is to remember old languages. Biological creatures change over time, and overwrite their old knowledge. A 600 year old centaur likely does not remember the language he spoke as a young colt, but a 600 year old vampire would, since being frozen in time is the whole point of their curse. Biologicals forget and move on, but the undead do not, and it applies to languages as well.

- and finally: if there is Magic in the setting, it very likely influences language as well. As a rule of the thumb, you do not want to cast spells using your regular language, or you run a risk on accidentally throwing a spell during normal conversation. This would encourage magical supes to forcibly try to make good quality languages obscure, but not forgotten. This way, these precise languages (like Latin) stay alive and learnable, but unlikely to spread to the general population and cause a leak of magical spells.

Is this true, or is this [[/r/badlinguistics]] ? Like, English and Indonesian could probably fit this bill, because languages are "turing complete" (I know that's not a real concept for natural language, but you can explain things: those lists of untranslatable vocabulary that proceed to /translate all the words/ are proof enough). If Classical Latin is special in some way, and that specialness is so important that supes would learn the language for spell casting/etc, then it would stand to reason that they might want to expand and improve on it and generate Latin 3.0?

***** about Latin:

Latin is a very old language, compared to English, that has fell out of use and codified. There are several chronological types of Latin, but Classical Latin is probably THE language that legal, medical, and scientific jargon is based on, precisely because it is a word-rich language with very well tested grammar rules.

English does not compare to that. English has messy grammar, and its a live language that keeps pirating words from other languages all the time, most notably from French, Spanish and German.

If you want a language for Magic, you need something that no longer changes, and is already as versatile as possibly needed. There is no concept that could not be worded using Latin, AFAIK.

Generation Latin 3.0 would be great, except the chaos that would happen DURING the development. If Latin was the language of magic, then messing up the declension in a sentence might not just mean failing an exam, or making a faux pas, but actually blowing yourself up. It would be like going from Imperial to Metric System, except if saying "10 inches!" or "20 centimeters!" could set your arm on fire.

*** A little late to the party, but two (plus one) ideas I thought worth mentioning:

1) I think that the native language of a supes species in power has the best chance of becoming the supernatural langua franca. Maybe one species of some means became alarmed by the growing population of humanity and began exerting influence on other supes to form an inter-species organization, in order to preempt the possibility of being divided and conquered by humanity's sheer numbers. And because they were the first and or most-influential mover, their language ended up on top. This has a (vaguely?) historical parallel to how English became so widespread thanks to the British Empire and post-WWII America.

2) As for what the native language of each supes species would be, I think that might depend on how each species originated. For example, in a straight adaptation from OG Greek mythology, it would make sense for the centaurs to have originally spoke ancient (or Mycenaean?) Greek, as the first of them were the offspring Ixion (ancient Greek bad guy) and Nephele (a woman Zeus made from scratch out of a cloud). Then, over time, as centaurs do their own thing, maybe they become isolated enough from other ancient (or Mycenaean?) Greek speakers that they develop their own dialect and or language. Or if instead the centaurs are created from scratch by some bored deity, then their original native language would come from whoever first teaches them to speak. And if no one bothers to teach them... then I guess they gradually develop their own, the same way early hominids to humans must have?

3) The siren idea sounds totes legit!

No idea if any of the above if actually helpful. I just wanted to contribute something two weeks ago, and then distractions happened until now.

**** Thanks so much for your comment! I apologise for taking so long to respond to it but I really wanted to take the time.

A lot of this is complicated by my setting not putting Our World on a pedestal: most supes live in "the underworld", essentially a second Earth / alternate dimension / plane of existence, and only a few bother to make a life on Earth. That said, many do live their whole lives there (my Greek siren for example), and others just happen to like it (maybe they're not popular with other supes, or just like isolation, or like free range human meat?). But it /does/ mean that the Underworld would have its own languages similar to Earth having its own languages, and maybe the Underworld lingua franca is what has caught on on Earth. But would they teach Undertongue to, say, vampires? I suppose it would only take one vampire to spread it, and Modern Vampires barter a lot in teaching skills, and being able to communicate with supes fairly reliable would be a pretty neat skill... hmmm.

I'm wondering if it's more legitimate that the Siren would have learned "Ancient Greek"(Mycenaean? idk, I'd research the right name) from Mommy Siren, or Vampire would have learned Undertongue from another vampire in a "trade" that would help with situations like this. The latter adds more depth to the story, but also might be a bit of an annoying aside to make when the alternative seems equally sensible.

1) Could definitely still work, more or less as written, with the proviso that the Supe that brings this along chooses Undertongue as it's the ~English(or Latin, French, Chinese depending on your era) equiv in the Underworld, and it's adopted after a bit of angry posturing between a few who think that Undertongue represents Kraken imperialism or whatever.

2) I like this as concept, but if we assume that supes originate in the Underworld waaaay back, and the populations that interacted with people in Greece/etc are small groups of weirdos who decided to live elsewhere, those people wouldn't be speaking Greek originally but whatever their "native" language was. But I suppose if they lived in Greece for a few generations they'd speak it too becuase why not. It just feels /weird/ having Sirens, which are clearly not human, speaking Greek, but... if they have brains and mouths they can /learn/, damnit.

Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to give me some thoughts to riff off of!

***** Okay! New information (to me); I'm totally down for some Duat / Otherworld / Norse cosmology / Nevernever geography. I think that the prevalence of “Undertongue” on Earth (and vice-versa, possibly) will mostly be a function of the relationship between Earth and the Underworld: if there is need to use the language it will be naturally maintained, and if not, it would likely atrophy, either falling into disuse in favour of other languages or gradually evolving into a new form. The obvious exceptions to all of the above are individuals (philologists?) who intend to preserve the Undertongue in its original form.

Slightly digression: Mycenaean Greek is a Bronze Age culture and language which declined during the Bronze Age Collapse, and is effectively the cultural-equivalent of “ancient Greece” to what we today call Ancient Greece (the Iron Age culture). It is, best as I can determine, the closest thing to a historical setting that can be applied to the “Heroic Age” of Greek mythology, and thus is the language that would have been spoken by Theseus, Heracles, and all the centaurs they fought and chilled with (...had they been real).

So, depending on the Siren's family history, if their lineage reaches all the way back to the Sirens that bothered the Argonauts and Odysseus, then it's plausible for Mycenaean Greek to be passed down within the family. But with Mycenaean having declined post-1150 BCE, more recent dialects may be more reasonable (see 2, below).

1) Now that I grasp the existence of the Underworld and Undertongue, I agree entirely! Also, Kraken (giant octopi???) imperialism sounds like... ultimate horror.

2) Agreed, if Undertongue is the original mother language of supes, then it's entirely a question of if or how much the various small out-groups accumulate other languages. As for the specific example of the Siren... well, in OG Greek myth, the lethal temptation of the Siren Song wasn't just its sheer musical beauty, but also its lyrical content (e.g., when they sang to Odysseus, they tempted him with the knowledge of “all things that come to pass on the fruitful earth”). So, if singing in a language understood by the audience increases the efficacy of Siren Song, then there is impetus for them to be current and multilingual.

Glad I could be helpful, and not just trying too hard to be cool-smart! XD

** Ideas for avoiding the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly][Gods Need Prayer Badly]] trope while still explaining why sacrifices are made to the God(s) and/or the God(s) are worshipped?

A few ideas I've already thought about. Feel free to expand upon them.

- The god(s) are simply egotistical.
- The worship/sacrifice have community building functions. For instance, animal sacrifices might serve as food for the priests. Large ceremonies might have a nationalistic role. (this is part of the real world reason). This does kind of beg the question as to the point of the gods then.
- The god(s) don't need worship/sacrifices, but people think they do and the gods don't care enough to correct them.
- The gods don't directly need worship/sacrifices, they are eternal/immortal, but the sacrifices allow them more influence on the world
- The gods are keeping score between themselves and worship/sacrifices are worth points. Or are a way of gaming the scoring method.
- The gods think worship is good for their followers psychologically (I think this is given as a reason by some Christian theologians)

Other ideas?

A god doesn't get weaker with fewer worshipers, they get less coherent, more subject to individuals. Structured worship and structured religion is a way for the gods to maintain a coherent identity, which most of them very much want to do. (Lots of implications of this.)
- Worship and sacrifice directly impact the world in some way that the gods like. Maybe the god who is constantly demanding goat sacrifices really, really hates goats. The sacrifice is something that is /done for the gods/ in the hopes that they will repay you.
- Worship and sacrifice are good for the worshipers, which is why the gods require or ask for it. Most of the religious strictures are actually food safety guidelines in disguise. Maybe prayer is structured as a method of making people think through their problems, or empathize with others, or some other quick hack to reduce conflict or find better solutions. Gods don't listen to every prayer, and can't answer all the ones they do listen to, but if you pray right, you'll be better off than if you never prayed at all, which is what the gods want (and of course, different gods have different methods of prayer). (Wait, shit, you already said this one.)

**** I really like the first one. Depending on the exact mechanic, the god might even prefer a smaller population of worshippers if it lets them get more committed or more homogenous worshippers that can be impressed with an exact perception of the god's identity. Or they could use a mystery religion setup to protect and cultivate their identity. Backstory for an urban fantasy take on YHWH: they accidentally erase their own identity and motivation in the process of trying to make themselves omniscient/omnipresent.

I thought of the basic idea of the last one, but you fleshed it out a lot better. Thinking about the real world, you can kind of see the different theologies at work in the different denominations of Christianity: the greedy requests of prosperity gospel, the more moderate requests of denominations with a less literal belief in the power of prayer, the formulaic prayers of Catholicism, the passive aggressive prayers and indirect gossip in Southern Baptists, etc. In a fantasy setting you could have a lot more specially designed prayers depending on the God's expertise and goals: complex patterns of therapeutic meditation, spells intermixed into the prayer, a communal way of addressing taboo topics... this seems like a really rich vein of ideas to explore.

Also, no pressure, but I am really psyched up for the Worth the Candle take on the gods.

would that also not work in the opposite way?

I mean, If Im a Horned Toad, the God of the Southern Swamps, this identity and my "story" woudl stay pretty coherent if I have 100 worshippers and they all know the Gospel of the Horned Toad by memory.

But If I have 1000 0000 worshippers, and they split into factions, reformants, counter-reformants, etc, then I would be averaged out into just Toadlike God of Vague Wilderness

*** - The gods don't want to be bothered by endless frivolous requests for their intervention. To keep things manageable, they instructed their priests that they would require sacrifices to provide their aid, with bigger sacrifices for bigger requests, and a threat of punishment for anyone who fails to appease them. In practice, these punishments are only used on people who are endlessly spamming them.

- The sacrifices can somehow be arranged to allow a prayer to get through a spam filter. The gods can basically ignore their millions of followers, and only receive messages when large and very specific sacrifices are made, like a barrel of absinthe and a basket of incense burned at sunset at a shrine to the god in question using a bonfire made with goat tallow and charcoal derived from willow saplings.

This website talks about gods in the ancient world though with a Greek and Roman bent. But here are some bullet points I half remember.

• Gods are in charge of certain things, you want to stay on the good side of as many as possible but mostly of the strongest ones

EX

War god, food god, weather god, god of childbirth

• But small gods will typical be sated with less and be easier to catch the attention of than the big ones

• Sacrifices to the gods is bartering for them to help you out

EX

Prayer: I give you chicken, you give me rain? God: Y?/N?

• Certain sacrifices happen because there's a reliable outcome from said sacrifices

EX

Priest: The earth god usually responds if we pour wine on the ground, dance for 5 minutes and fast for 3 days.

Earth god: You did it right so sure, soil is now fertile

*** In classical myth, the usual explanation was that the gods didn't /need/ sacrifice (they existed and were powerful before they made humans, after all), but they did /enjoy/ the sensation of being sacrificed to immensely. The smell of burnt offerings being pleasurable to them is often mentioned.

Of course, there were differing schools of thought on this historically! But this was a common theory, anyway. (And that's without getting into different religions, e.g. the Aztec gods did literally depend on sacrifice for power IIRC.)

** How to make it plausible that a new player of a game is the first that finds a combination of skills and/or items that is quite powerful or profitable?

In games today players theorycraft and test just about everything very quickly, so finding an unknown combo needs some mitigating circumstances to be plausible.

Some things I have been thinking about are (in no particular order):

- Large number of clesses, skills and items makes theorycrafting take more effort and time. This is not in itself a barrier, but helps amplify below points.
- The game has been live a long time, and things that has been theorycrafted and "proven" to be useless might interact with things released years later. Theorycrafters may be working with outdated assumptions.
- If people are able to earn real world money by playing the game, the sharing of information might be less free than it is in games today. Fewer theorycrafters have a complete picture. On the other hand, successful guilds may hire entire teams of theorycrafters.
- Categories of classes, skills or items may have a "bad reputation" as being useless; for example in a VRMMO some professions or skills might be primarily for the enjoyment of the players rather than effectiveness in dungeons. They may be passed over when theorycrafting.
- Some effects may only be discoverable if you have knowledge in the area the effect is intended for and an (more or less) related area where it has an interesting side effect. Or perhaps only if you /perform tests/ using skills and/or items from those two areas. If one area has "bad reputation", there may be few theorycrafting players who can perform those tests due to their class and skill choices.
- The combo is powerful only in a narrow scope that is not common, either because it has "bad reputation" or because there is little attractive content of that scope. That scope can, with the combo, somehow be leveraged to greater potential.
- There are combos that are easier to discover that are equally or more powerful but has some cost or limitation that can be avoided using the new combo.
- Rarity of items that are key to the combo may also limit who can perform tests. Too rare, or especially /previously unknown/, items will potentially make the reader feel like the combo is handed to the character.\\
- Being a single character game would limit players to testing (but not theorycrafting) things using the class, skills and items they have access to.\\

Any other ideas? How much is needed, in your opinion, to make it plausible that a new player finds an undiscovered combo?

*** That's a good list. To add to it:

- Theorycrafters might be mistaken about how a mechanic actually works, due to either a misreading of the rules, rules which have a different implementation from what the UI shows, or something else.
- The combo might be powerful only in a team/group/guild setting, which is harder to theorycraft for due to combinatoric explosion and the general difficulties of attempting to theorycraft how two or more builds might work together.
- There are unknown bugs or anomalies within the skills that were never discovered because testing (both by the devs and by the theorycrafters) was focused on other areas.

Generally speaking, I think most people will give you a bit of a pass if it's the conceit of the work, so you don't need to put in that much effort to figuring it out. It would be better to, IMO, but not /necessary/.

*** I currently can't think of a single novel, even trash ones, that failed in plausibly explaining why the undiscovered combo was undiscovered. Most of the probability failures were in other aspects of the worldbuilding, like economics/politics/real-world assassins going after the MC (?????)/ nonsensical game balance/inconsistent explanations.

LitRPG and VRMMORPG type stories have a relatively high probability buy-in and many of your provided circumstances are basically freebies in worldbuilding. Undiscovered combo kind of falls under the buy-in,and it's basically free as well.

The things you need to consider are the secondary effects of the discovery and basically explaining or showing the meta. Some bad novels don't properly explain why no one else copies the MC. Or if other people do copy, don't think about the secondary effects properly. Sometimes, the meta doesn't shift and the MC remains the dominating outlier, which doesn't make sense either.

*** In competitive settings, the meta could have settled into a stable configuration with several dominate strategies/builds/approaches. An newcomer might try something entirely different which people believe won't work at the highest level of play, but the newcomer manages to progressively improve on it and tweak their new thing to counter the meta. When the newcomer reaches the highest level, their off-meta strategy has the additional merit of being totally unexpected

For a real world example... not a MMORPG example, but rather a virtual CCG example... in Shadowverse, the meta changes every 3 months as new cards are released. I can think of several times were the meta seemed thoroughly explored by the 2nd month and then an off-meta deck suddenly rises to prominence in the last month. Hypothetically if a less experienced or more stubborn player started with the basis for that off meta-deck in the first few weeks and stuck with it, tweaking it to counter the meta that emerged, they could have around an entire month or so in which their off-meta deck not only beats the meta decks by directly countering them but also because the players using the meta decks don't know the right counterplays to the off-meta deck.

In an MMO setting, the new player might simply be lucky and/or stubborn and stick with something that seems unoptimal for far too long and gradually find a way of tweaking it to counter something meta.

In general, I think readers will accept at least one lucky break as part of the premise if it happens at the beginning of the story.

Hm. I need the combo to be a solution to a major problem rather than a starting point. The main character struggles with this problem and figures out a solution quite a bit into the story (it is crafting related rather than fighting if that matters).

***** If there original luck was picking or having the opportunity to get the right item/class/skill/ability (in spite of the meta or theorycrafters or recommended builds) and their subsequent finding of a key combo builds off that initial premise, then it should be acceptable to the reader, especially if it is foreshadowed.

So for instance, if the main character picks a crafting class against the recommended starting classes and happens to make it initially work, and most of the meta focused players don't bother with focusing on crafting (perhaps crafted items are viewed as inferior to rare dropped items at the highest level of play, and items purchased from NPCs are an acceptable stopgap), then the main character finding new combos within the crafting class should be acceptable for the reader.

Later, the main character solves an important problem by finding a new synergy that at its core is a few skills (generally considered useless) and an item (also generally considered useless). The skills and item have been known for some time, but the combination is unknown.

That is why I want it to be plausibly obscure.

The reason why Entities are close to mindless is because of their anti-malware procedure. You see, among anti-cancer laser and reprogramable flesh white cell, they have the total perspective canon (a concept taken from hitchhiker guide to the galaxy ) as part of their routine checkup.

So, if a shard gain the abilty to understand what is their context and understand their place in it (a requierement to apply tool correctly) then they also become succeptible to the total perspective canon effect.
