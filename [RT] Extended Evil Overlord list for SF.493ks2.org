Charlie Stross has put together a list of common mistakes/cliches in space opera that looks real handy for anyone aspiring to rational worldbuilding in an SF setting. [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/03/towards-a-taxonomy-of-cliches-.html#more][Link]]


** The original Evil Overlord list was both helpful and funny, while this one comes off as insulting. It also implicitly states that soft SF is inherently inferior.

*** While I am of the opinion that, in the end, it is up to the reader to make that judgement call, I will admit to a sort of...slow-burning fury that wells up within me whenever I read Sci-Fi with classic dogfighting, or spaceship battles that are just glorified exchanges of cannon fire in space-water where all the ships line up in a pretty formation and fire at each other, or when our intrepid heroes land on an alien planet, grab some kudzu, and chow down because fuck proteins am I right?, or a number of other things that this list covered.

From my perspective, yes, well written soft Sci-Fi is in fact inherently inferior to well written hard Sci-Fi, but well written soft SF is superior to poorly written hard SF.

** TL;DR: this list is extremely misleading.

Firstly, conflating "cliches" and "mistakes" is a weird move. A cliche is something that's so common it's become boring. It isn't something that's unrealistic or factually untrue. Those are different things, and you deal with them differently, and they have different consequences for the reader.

#+begin_quote

  1. Planetary civilizations
#+end_quote

About half of these are different ways of saying "don't do single-biome planets".

This is a) common knowledge, and b) actually pretty rare, when you consider that most scifi only ever visits a single location on a given planet.

It's also arguably a popular misconception /in itself/, since most planets don't have Earthlike axial tilt, and most planets have very few areas that would appear visually distinct to a human, since most planets are uninhabitable (and uninhabi/ted/) wastelands.

#+begin_quote
  You can fly anywhere at Mach 2.2+ without experiencing hull heating due to atmospheric friction
#+end_quote

This ... isn't a cliche /or/ a mistake, is it? It's just a fact about how some fictional spaceships work.

A lot of fictional spaceships don't even work this way, since everybody /knows/ that moving sufficiently fast will cause you to heat up.

Also, this is itself a misconception; the issue isn't friction, it's that the air heats up as it's compressed in front of the craft.

#+begin_quote
  You can fly anywhere at Mach 2.2+ without worrying about Air Traffic Control and NOTAMs
#+end_quote

/glances at which sub-heading we're under/

Why would you mention it at all, if it's not plot-relevant? Why would you assume that an alien civilization has come to the same solution as us for this, if you're trying to /break/ cliches? Especially if they have better technology than us.

Also, most scifi does in fact show some form of air-traffic control when approaching inhabited stations.

#+begin_quote
  Deep carbon cycle, subduction, ionosphere UV splitting of water, long-term terraforming stability: why worry about little things like that?

  Coriolis force, trade winds, cyclones, what are those?
#+end_quote

... usually irrelevant in scifi? Still, I guess bringing them up /would/ violate a cliche ...

#+begin_quote
  Some planets have a breathable atmosphere but no water
#+end_quote

Not totally sure where he's going with this. That oxygenated atmospheres can't sustain themselves without life? That sufficiently dry air is annoying (but breathable) and dehydrates you faster?

(Aside: how often does scifi specify there's /no/ water on a planet, as opposed to relatively little water compared to Earth? I can't recall ever seeing this.)

#+begin_quote

  1. Space and cosmology
#+end_quote

hoo boy

#+begin_quote

  - Moons are good, the more the better!
  - Suns are good, too, the more the better!
#+end_quote

Ugh. I know, right?

#+begin_quote
  ... Especially if one of them is a giant. (Those never explode or flare messily.)
#+end_quote

... is he implying that large stars don't have a Goldilox zone, or are sufficiently short-lived and volatile that they'd destroy any life forming? Scifi writers have no sense of scale indeed.

#+begin_quote
  Planetary ring systems are picturesque, not dangerous
#+end_quote

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ME5jhsgmB4][Indeed]].

No, hang on a sec. In all seriousness, planetary rings aren't dangerous, unless you physically crash into them like an idiot. They cast a shadow, that's about the only thing scifi doesn't acknowledge. (Although there is a tendency to get confused about the composition of planetary rings - they're pretty fine.)

#+begin_quote
  Planets have magnetic poles that approximate their rotational axis
#+end_quote

... yes, quite a lot of planets do? And it's been speculated that they may be a precondition for life, so that's kind of important.

Also, how often does this come up in scifi? I'd honestly be surprised if something brought up the details of planetary magnetic fields, not that Stross seems to know them.

#+begin_quote
  Planetary gravity can be approximated to a point source for purposes of calculating orbital dynamics
#+end_quote

Well ... yes, they can.

#+begin_quote
  If you are in geosynchronous orbit away from the equator you still hover over the same spot on the planetary surface all the time
#+end_quote

Yeah, there's no such thing as a geostationary orbit over points that aren't on the equator. Unless you're cheating by constantly hovering in place using schizotech, rather than orbiting.

#+begin_quote
  All satellites orbit the equator
#+end_quote

Are we talking planetary satellites? Because yes, they do.

#+begin_quote
  The flight time between planets in an inner star system is the same as between planets in the outer system
#+end_quote

Again, this point is reiterated multiple times for some reason, but it's actually a good one.

#+begin_quote
  Actually, hitting a space rock or other spaceship is no big deal, a bit like being in a minor car accident
#+end_quote

Another "let's make the same point 15 times" one. This point is ... kind of the main reason most scifi ships have shields of some kind? But technically true, I guess.

#+begin_quote
  Gas giants are good for mining volatiles ... Because dealing with Mach 6 wind shear, 10,000 Bar pressure, and a lethally deep gravity well is trivial
#+end_quote

Actually

a) it's not the depth of the gravity well, it's the slope, and gas giants aren't particularly lethal on that front (because very large,)

b) gas giants have regions of human-compatible pressure, because again, they're /large/, and run the full gamut from "absurd" to "very low" as you move upwards from the core,

c) Gas giants are, again, /very large/, and there are plenty of regions that are perfectly calm.

This from a guy who just finished ranting about how planets are large and you shouldn't treat them as having a single biome ...

#+begin_quote

  1. Biology

  /Biology is complicated---so much so that many SF authors suffer from Dunning-Kruger syndrome in approaching the design of life-supporting planets./
#+end_quote

I'd point out that Dunning-Kruger is an urban myth, but then, this whole essay/listicle is basically a giant example of it.

#+begin_quote
  All planets harbour a single X
#+end_quote

Evolutionary niches, what are they? (This is occasionally an issue, but it's so vague ...)

#+begin_quote
  The native flora and fauna use a biochemistry that we can derive sustenance from
#+end_quote

/sigh/ yeah ...

#+begin_quote
  Pay no attention to the native microbiota, they're harmless
#+end_quote

Literally the point after pointing out that /we/ couldn't eat alien lifeforms.

#+begin_quote
  There are no native parasites that might eat Maize, so we can turn the entire largest continent into a robot-run plantation
#+end_quote

... wtf?

#+begin_quote
  Terraforming is really simple; you can do it with algae capsules delivered from orbit
#+end_quote

I mean ... maybe? I'm not sure how "some kind of hypertech tailored algae capsule" equates to "simple" to you, but whatever.

#+begin_quote
  Ecosystems are robust; why not let your ship's cat stretch her legs whenever you land?
#+end_quote

What, a single cat?

#+begin_quote
  photosynthesis
#+end_quote

/glares/ I know, right?

#+begin_quote

  1. Economics

  Everyone uses Money to mediate exchanges of value
#+end_quote

Probably, yeah. Pretty much all human societies do.

#+begin_quote
  Money is always denominated in uniform ratios divisible by 10
#+end_quote

/glances at all modern currencies/ I'm sure we'll go back to pounds and shillings soon enough. this is just a passing fad

#+begin_quote
  Money is made out of shiny bits of metal, OR pieces of green paper, OR credit stored in a computer network
#+end_quote

Green paper is silly, but how often is currency green in scifi? Not /that/ often, right?

Still, alternate currency schemes are interesting. Go forth and create interesting types of currency, y'all.

#+begin_quote
  Planetary credit networks
#+end_quote

We do ... kind of have one of those already?

#+begin_quote
  Barter is a sign of primitive people who haven't invented money
#+end_quote

Economic orthodoxy until recently, but yeah, this isn't how it works.

#+begin_quote
  Because your body is just one of your fungible assets, right?
#+end_quote

What a crazy idea that could never happen.

Anyway, I'm bored now. I think this all makes my point pretty clear - this list is mostly wrong, and unbearably smug all the while.

Also, it makes me extremely dubious about buying Accelerando ... huh, the same guy who wrote this wrote wrote the /Laundry/ series? That was good!

... wait, was he under the impression that those were /hard science-fiction?/

Except if you look up, because /our very own moon/ orbits closer to the sun's equatorial plane than to Earth's. And there are many examples which have been documented for decades, if not centuries, of other moons in our own solar system which also have notable orbital inclinations.

***** ...Except no? Because they don't, any more than they orbit any other sequence of points on the planetary surface - which is the point that Stross was making. Just because quite a lot of them /do/ (to a certain degree, anyway) doesn't mean that all of them do, or should be expected to do, or that even the ones which are very nearly equatorial are exactly so.

The cliché being railed against was that of every moon in every planetary system orbiting in nearly circular, nearly perfectly equatorial orbits. It's a quick visual shortcut when the details don't matter, sure, but it's lazy and actually counter to natural formation when you're setting an entire book on a world with a particular set of natural satellites.

Someone I know put it in perspective - it was OK to gloss over this kind of thing back before Google, because no-one expected authors to go do the heavy lifting needed to make various aspects of their works reasonably realistic. But the bar for quality has been lifted as the amount of work required to do said research has plummeted, because these days the /readers/ have the internet at their fingertips as well, and are far more likely at some point to have idly wandered through one or more wikipedia pages regarding moons, orbits, tides, satellite formation, effects on planetary ecologies, and so on. And if they haven't, it's an effort of mere seconds for them to do so at any point if they ever feel inclined.

Stories - /books/ - in which everything is cookie-cutter handwaved are going to be competing with ones in which the author actually bothered to put at least five minutes' effort into some basic research and was therefore able to include something more realistic and interesting, giving them an edge in detail and entertainment value, and a more three-dimensional world-setting, without requiring a corresponding additional suspension of disbelief. It's no crime to want better-quality stories.

Not to mention, when stories these days are discussed to death online, torn apart and nitpicked and clucked over with every new author release, including these kinds of details can help towards maintaining reader interest, giving them something to discuss, and improving the fandom community. That's not a bad thing. And all it needs is a couple of hours - sometimes even just minutes - in front of a computer in order to add that extra aspect.

****** If anything, I run into /more/ weird orbits in fiction than in real life. "Ooh, this species lives on a planet that spends a THOUSAND YEARS in the frozen depths of space, so everything is adapted to the freezing cold! This technological civilization arose while they were away from their star, and now they're approaching it again! This planet has TWO rings at right angles to each other!"

I'm not arguing in favour of fiction being unrealistic. (There are arguments for that, but I'm not making them - it /does/ bug me when fiction is unrealistic.)

I'm arguing that "moons orbit around the equator in roughly circular orbits" is a good rule of thumb that will produce realistic results 99% of the time, unless you happen to include a full Star Atlas of your chosen universe and it shows all of them in artificially perfect regular orbits.

** This list is telling me a highly realistic sci-fi story using common themes would probably be very boring.

A lot of these "mistakes" are deliberate choices made for the sake of story. You can clean up some of them, and the ones tut-tuting the use of cliches are fine, but without making SOME assumptions/contrived circumstances... well there is a niche genre that it could end up as (a very interesting one too), but I don't think its fair to limit sci-fi to that niche.

I'm willing to suspend disbelief. A lot of these rules are just complaining about an author techno-babbling her way through an issue, instead of finding a real solution. I don't see how it is necessary for authors to come up with /actual/ solutions to problems that might exist /if there story were actually reality/.

You are aware that rational stories can include magic right? Rational sci-fi <> Hard scifi.

When the sidebar says a "cosistant world" it doesnt mean the author is limited 1:1 to what is -known- to be true In the real world.
