Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** his name comes up often enough on this sub, but I recently blew through all of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang][Ted Chiang]]'s short stories for the first time and wanted to renew the recommendation for people who haven't seen them yet. I didn't care much for the movie /Arrival/, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the original short story ("Story of Your Life") was much more focused and soulful. His stories posit fantastical premises and follow them through to their logical conclusions, but more than that, they are constructed in ways that meld together seemingly-disparate themes and ideas in astonishing ways. All of his major works are collected across two books - /Stories of Your Life and Others/ (republished just as /Arrival/) and /Exhalation: Stories/ - but you can track most/all of them down with a quick Google. I don't think any of his stories are bad, but many are fairly insubstantial; of his longer stuff I most enjoyed:

- "The Lifecycle of Software Objects" - parenting and learning are big themes in Chiang's work (see also "Exhalation", "Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny", "Understand"), but this story might do the best job of exploring them? Also interesting discussion of AI and software development, but there's loads more going on here besides
- "Hell is the Absence of God" - a modern-day horror retelling of the Book of Job. Lots of Chiang's stuff kinda reminds me of /Unsong/ - see also "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate" and "Tower of Babylon"

#+end_quote

I would like Arrival so much more if it didn't completely conclude on literally the antithesis of Story of Your Life. I read the book before watching the film and as it progressed I was getting more and more confused.

The book concludes that there is no such thing as free will. This is emphasised because the daughter's death in the book is a random event that could easily be stopped not some genetic disease. In the movie they say free will exists but having nice memories with a daughter is worth the pain and emphasises her choice to have a kid.

**** I think you're right about the random event being more compelling than disease, but would question whether the "thesis" of the short story is that free will doesn't exist. One of the last lines is "From the beginning I knew my destination, and I chose my route accordingly", and if you look at Chiang's later works concerned with the topic ("The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate", "What's Expected of Us" and "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom") I think you get the impression that he believes very strongly in the idea of choice even in deterministic paradigms. From the commentary of "Merchant": "I wanted to try writing a time-travel story where the inability to [change the past] wasn't necessarily a cause for sadness. [...] acceptance of fate is one of the basic articles of faith in Islam."

***** I haven't read his other works but your quote is exactly in line with what I intended. She chose her route to match what she saw. The important word is "accordingly". She was incapable of choosing other than the future. This is mentioned a number of times as I remember. I am definitely not suggesting that it didn't feel like a choice, otherwise she would just save her daughter. Maybe if you want to get in some semantics about free will but either way I think it was clear from the book that it is a deterministic universe (ignoring how seeing into the future wouldn't work if there were branching timelines anyway) and that everything happens at once, time is just another dimension. No more can you teleport from one spot to another or walk one way and arrive in another place can you change time. Any other explanation doesn't make sense with the actions of the aliens either. Choice must not actually exist for the alien plot of the book to work. I don't want to get into a semantic argument about free will and compatibilism, suffice to say by "free will" I mean determinism, and the movie does not focus on the acceptance of the determinism of the universe but instead as I said suggests that the universe is not deterministic and that she could have chosen differently

***** Nothing that's got the same "hard science to magic" vibe, no. Stuff that's related-ish:

- RoyalRoad:

  - "I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)" - has the main character actively experimenting with the weird mechanics of how the "Lavi" and "Qi" work, but doesn't have the mundane-earth-science side.
  - "Cultivating Earth" (on hiatus) - an ancient Cultivator decides to set up a sect on Earth because it's a planet that's developed civilisation without Qi due to his actions. Very well written and I'm still hoping it starts up again.
  - "Eight" - has the MC applying their skills at woodscraft and knowledge about spiritual matters they'd learned from their family, rather than science.

- Sufficient Velocity:

  - "Marked for Death" - inbetween attempting mostly successfully to survive in a rationalised version of Naruto (which is a horrifying deathworld), the quest-avatar character attempts to Do Science to chakra and seals. (With mixed results.)

- Fanfiction.net

  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project]] Rationalised DBZ - I'm not particularly a fan of the setting, so I've stopped following this one, but it does fit

- Other

  - Ra, by qntm ([[https://qntm.org/ra]]) - "Discovered in the 1970s, magic is now a bona fide field of engineering. There's magic in heavy industry and magic in your home. It's what's next after electricity." Hard magic-sci-fi.
  - Saga of Soul ([[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/]]) - "The story begins when Eriko, an introverted bookworm, suffers a near-death experience. Instead of walking toward the Light, she takes it upon herself to perform scientific experiments, which leads to her acquiring magical powers."

***** I loved the anime, but that was admittedly with consciously making some allowances for the fact that it's trying to be a fun adventure story (and pro-science propaganda) for young kids, basically copying battle manga/anime like Naruto and so on but making science the focus instead of battle. So I kind of have to agree with your criticism here as far as realism goes.

The bad guy is unrealistically strong, Senku unrealistically smart, devices tend to work unrealistically well, inspirational speeches tend to meet wide-eyed acceptance, etc., often just simply because it's that kind of story. But at the same time, it's a researched story, and conveys believable/true scientific concepts in terms of tech dependencies, and also pays good attention to things like continuity and character growth.

Charles Stross plays in this space quite a bit, and has the least frivolous takes I can think of, though this is not a strong statement. The Family Trade series has quite a few characters going both ways between medieval/fantasy and modern worlds. The Nightmare Stacks, from his Laundry series, has a POV fantasy character cross over to modern Britain, and follows that up with a full scale invasion - you don't need to have read the previous books in the series to enjoy this one.

The Strugatsky brothers have some uniquely depressing takes adjacent to this; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_from_Hell][The Kid from Hell]] is probably the closest.

The plot is that the mostly-rational main character of the magitech WW1 anime enters politics following a moderately worse version of canon (ie, like actual WW1) and succeeds /Springtime for Hitler/ style. There are minor issues with the worldbuilding that most people (not having any experience in national politics or international diplomacy outside of strategy video games, a couple whiggish biographies and some movies) will not notice and the small cast of characters are written very well. At present the epilogue has yet to be posted, but the author's rationale that the story must end because the lead has won and is no longer an outsider to the establishment is valid. 4/5

I would also like to recommend the excellent animated films of multiple oscar-nominee Don Hertzfeldt and his associates. All but his three feature-length works are on youtube and they display an excellent concern for the open psychological and existential questions concerning human mortality, with the three feature length works critically examining the question of identity with respect to transhumanism. 5/5

Finally, I recommend the pre-canon Naruto fanfic [[https://fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1][Compass of thy soul]] and it's sequel, [[https://fanfiction.net/s/13388642/1/Direct-thee-to-Peace][Direct thee to peace]], which finished last week. It is a capably written story about the rigors of internecine warfare on the military families in the setting, and the author has clearly researched the living conditions of pre-unification Japan. The sequel drops the ball to become a moderately hammy story about a family of patriarchs and scions coming to blows over their differences but it remains engaging and the cast are mostly rational even if breaks SoD on the nature of civil and military governance. 4/5

Given that he's a pretty good writer, I think if he hadn't felt rushed by his obligation to patreon and browbeaten by spacebattles, he could have figured a better plot for the the third 'book'. Maybe an inversion of the conceit of the first two books, e.g. she tries to succeed and actually fails.

*** I quite liked Compass of thy soul and Direct thee to peace, but upon reflection the stories had super questionable pro-authoritarian politics. On a macro level the duology maintains that royalty is implicitly better than everyone else due to, effectively, the divine right of kings (in this case as expressed by the Uchiha doujutsu), and that everything would have been better if the Senju had just known their place.

There was also a bunch of weird Christian stuff in the background - there's very little mention of the Kamis at all but whenever it comes up the MC makes vague references to believing in monotheism still, and the reincarnated MC introduces a bunch of our-world songs to the Uchiha clan, at least one of which is from Veggie Tales. It's fine and mostly stays out of the way, up until like the last couple of paragraphs in DTP, where you're smashed over the head with a literal deathbed conversion.

Both stories were good, don't get me wrong, but if you dislike getting ambushed by Christian (or authoritarian) themes in novels you should go into them with your eyes open.

Authoritarian ruling power weren't always socially backward. Social progress from feudal conglomerates was toward absolute power of the king. On that stage the kings were often in symbiotic relationship with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm#Third_Estate][Third Estate]] - upper and middle strata of commoners, especially with free cities.

** Book 16 of the Dresden Files series drops tomorrow, so now's as good a time as any to recommend the series. It's about a private detective who is a wizard. I recommend the series for its very large and enjoyable world and the wide breadth of characters, both of which seem to grow with every book. You have interesting fairies (who love making deals), several flavours of vampires, fallen angels, vague Lovecraftian threats slowly coming nearer, vanilla mortal gangsters, wizard politics, holy knights, and all kinds of other fun stuff. Most religions are true to some degree, as well. Not rational/ist/, but most of the time the characters actively and intelligently pursue their goals, and there are some clever plots and traps throughout.

Downsides: Some readers think the main character is sexist because he doesn't like hurting women and doesn't expect them to betray him or beat him in a fair fight, but I do feel the need to point out that this is a character flaw that actively hurts him again and again, and he gradually learns not to make those mistakes. Also it was the author's first book series, so the first two books are significantly less enjoyable than the rest, but you can easily start with book 3 for vampires or book 4 for fairy politics and not miss much (The author made an effort to make them good entry points)... Or you can power through the first two books if you want. They aren't /bad/, they just aren't great like what comes after.

The audiobooks are fantastic, as well. Narrated by James Marsters, who played Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Well, that, and there's a definite male gaze going on, where he tends to describe women primarily based on how sexually attractive he finds them. Even his best friend's teenaged daughters, which gets squickier each time a few years passes and the next daughter hits puberty.

** I've got two things two recommend today. TW: Ponies

*First*, I want to recommend basically everything by *Forthwith*([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3196486/Forthwith16][fanfic]], [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173607/Forthwith/stories][fimfic]]), especially the mlp fanfics [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power][Seeking Power]] , [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]] , and the Code Geass fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870721/1/Kallen-Stadtfeld-Countess-of-Britannia][Kallen Stadtfeld, Countess of Britiannia]].

Forthwith's stories are inspired by HPMOR, often fairly explicitly. Both the MLP fics have a main character very similar to HJPEV and relationships/strategies that will feel familiar. Also, as you might imagine, it doesn't take much for Lelouch from Code Geass to be a rationalist. Overall, the writing is high quality, the plotting is good, and the humor is fun. The Moon's Apprentice is complete, Seeking Power was just majorly revised with an eye toward continuation, and the Code Geass Fic updates in batches every few months. Also, I wouldn't be shocked if the author is on this subreddit, so hello! if that's the case.

*Second*, I kind of want to recommend the mlp fic [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25966/austraeoh][Austraeoh]]

I say kind of because there are some major pros and cons to this fic, which I'll go through, but it's just so unique I want to talk about it for a little bit.

*What is Austraeoh about?*

Austraeoh is an epic journey. It is long. No, really, it's longer than what you're thinking. At almost 3.7 million words it is currently roughly 3 times the length of Worm and about 1.5 times the current length of A Practical Guide to Evil. It's one of the longest works in the English language. After a two-year hiatus it just started updating again, so who knows how far there still is to go. It features a single main character, Rainbow Dash, traveling east, and touches on various companions that join and leave her along the way. Book 1 is basically a standalone. Books 2-6 are a set which introduce some wonderful side characters. Books 7-8 mark a new start, and Book 9 (in progress) continues from book 8, but is clearly a significant break from the previous books.

*Pros:*

- Some very interesting plotting. In particular, the hero/villain plotting and counter plotting toward the end of the eighth book is some of the most unique I've read with a final outcome that hits like a freight train. The villains throughout are compelling and frightening without being copycats of one another. I'd say most characters behave reasonably, without too many egregious idiot balls, but there are a few. To be fair, the main character is not known for her intelligence. I don't recall anything that broke my suspension of disbelief too much, but I have a high tolerance for that type of thing.
- Fairly fast pace. Because the main character is constantly traveling, local plot points are brought up and resolved at a reasonable speed. Overarching points take longer but there is definite development fairly frequently. It's certainly not just a meandering mess of hanging plot points that you might fear from it's length.
- Characters are a strong point. They are by and large well rendered and enjoyable. Rainbow Dash really grows and develops as a person (pony) and in later books that comes into fascinating conflict with who she used to be. I don't like original characters as a rule, but the ones in this series really won me over with their diverse voices and unique perspectives. Good characters do bad things and vice versa, and they grow and learn from the experience. (One dude is blind but has a magical echo-location device, which obviously isn't personality based, but is awesome.)
- Epic scale/stakes. The series touches on things like ringworlds and cosmic civilizations. This is more the underlying plot than the main one, so think of it as a bonus rather than the primary reason to read the series. In addition, the stakes in each conflict Rainbow Dash gets into feel very real. She doesn't always win and when she fails there are real consequences for her or for characters she (and the reader) have come to care about. There are a few emotional farewells, and one in particular at which I shed a tear.

*Cons:*

- Writing is idiosyncratic. I won't say bad, because it's not, but it varies widely in level of maturity. Some of the emotional scenes are incredibly weighty and well written, while some of the humor is crude and goes on for far too long. Other sections are shockingly dark. Children get tortured/killed, both on screen and off. It's not for the faint of heart, but looking at a chapter at random you wouldn't guess how dark it can get. Also, the author uses words that I've never seen anywhere else. They're immediately intelligible, but somewhat strange.
- Length. I said it before, but in all honesty, I'm not sure this series is better than the sum value of the ten or so other books you could read in the meantime. Fortunately, it's written in fairly discrete increments, so it's relatively easy to put down and pick back up. I am glad I read it, but I can't imagine rereading it.
- Unfinished. The author is writing again, after quite a long time, but there is still clearly quite some ways to go before the end of this journey. I hope he makes it to the end, but I don't think even he would guarantee it.

*Final thoughts:* this is by the author of [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/background-pony][Background Pony]] which I can wholeheartedly recommend and is one of the MLP fandom's favorite stories. He knows how to write a dramatic and impactful story. I personally find something deeply satisfying about starting an absurdly long series and having it feel like a worthwhile journey as I slowly work my way through it. In some ways, odd as it sounds, this series reminds me of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen][Malazan Book of the Fallen]] (another very good, very long, occasionally very dark series).

If you're uncertain, I'd say give it at least through book 2. The first book sets up a lot of things, but the second book is where the world really starts to expand and the secondary characters come into their own. As I said, it's not for everyone, but I think it might appeal to some of the people on this subreddit. At the very least, I hope you marvel at the time and energy this one strange person has put into a single story.

Also there is (light book 1 spoilers) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPA8FFeDLw][fan music]] and (book 1 spoilers)[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18tWAkwuOqc][animation]]

The magic system does operate under an IP system which makes sense given the rules described, gives special keys to spells to access them, has an entity with all the spells to enforce the compact, and takes steps to catch people who have found the potential antimeme through monopolistic contracts to report new sellers. Animals and plants naturally evolve and cast spells but end up bottlenecked by the non-scalar law so are limited to local areas. People get around the non-scalar law with the communication trick measuring intensity changes in a spell. The villain is moustache twirlingly evil but gets rid of enemies because he doesn't want to teach dozens of new archmages who will then break his monopoly on the technology he makes all his money from after a leak of half of the secret meta-spell online makes it obvious to anyone. It definitely isn't on the level of HPMOR or Ra but attempts to take itself seriously as a system and doesn't throw out its own rules for inconsistent reasons.

** I've recently found [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][Dark Skies]] to be extremely addicting and enjoyable.

The POV character figures out life and challenges from a near tabula rasa state. They are both very clever and also intentionally written as lacking in common sense, which I greatly enjoyed. It's a well written perspective which I found scratched my rationalist itches as the MC figures out the world around them.

The author is very good at what I view as a sort of slow burn intensity. Obstacles are set up for the MC and then you watch over an arc as they figure out the bits and pieces to required to meet the current challenge. YMMV if this is a pacing style you enjoy - it can get rather drawn out and intense. I found it very addicting.

I wouldn't quite say it meets the bar of being rational, but some of the elements are there. Going by the sidebar, there is definitely focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of knowledge and resources. Plenty of intellectual payoff so far too.

On the non-rational side, worldbuilding is hit and miss. A lot of thought goes into many pieces of it, but at the same time some others feel like they were initially tacked on for the convenience of the current plot with acceptable but not great explanations later (one example: a species of small animals that can climb trees for a clear and pronounced benefit, but don't 'because they are too stupid to realize this'). The same is true for apparent goals and motives. Sometimes side character actions seem a little plot motivated, although mostly the motivations are well fleshed out.

Overall, I'd still recommend the fiction as a highly enjoyable read - especially for those that enjoy rationalist characters - although it falls somewhat short of the bar to be fully considered rational.
