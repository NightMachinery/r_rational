** Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

- Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
- Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
- The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

** Great read as always! You have Fray as Flay once.

This chapter got me thinking about the scale of powers we see in this universe. I'm used to things like Worm and X-Men, where most powers are fairly weak unless used correctly, with a few extremely powerful individuals mixed in. So far, the only powers we've seen in Delphic have been A-list--car-throwing superstrength and telekinesis, extremely fast flight/superspeed, flawless invisibility/invincibility, and of course Hector's unlimited retrovoyance. I wonder if there are shitty supers or ones even more epic than we've seen, or if for whatever reason everyone's powers are at about the same level.

*** The story has included weaker supers - all three of the Ottawa team members are very much on the weak side of what professional supers can do. I think there's a bias in my storytelling in that any Super Team is going to deploy their "heavies" in a wise way, and not tend to pit weak powers against something they can't take down.

Crappier powers also exist, but those people don't join super teams. We will see if I get a chance to introduce more of that in the story, or maybe as a subject for side chapters.

** If I was Hector, I'd consider tracing back Spinner's movements for the past few months. He's clearly used to being sent around (or even out) of the country to bloodhound supers. I'd want to know if the guy has been to Detroit recently.

Really enjoying the story so far.
