*** I think the /gameplay/ is "rational" (if that even means anything) but I'd strongly disagree that the /themes/ are rational, for the following very-spoilery reason. (Seriously, this comment is meant to engage conversation with people who have already played the game; don't click if you intend to play!)

All throughout the game I assumed the endgame would involve saving everyone. My assumption the whole way through was that all the lovable Hearthians I met on Timber Hearth, plus the Hearthian astronauts scattered across the solar system who had become my friends, I was gonna somehow be able to round them all up and save them from the approaching destruction of the sun. Then I got to the endgame and the moral of the story turned out to be: Sometimes the Universe ends, killing everyone, and the correct thing to do is to be at peace with that eventuality. Which thoroughly transhuman me found to be some real bullshit. So the entire ending sequence left me pretty mad!

Still heartily recommend the experience of playing the game though!

**** I agree with you.

Major spoilers below.

I was mostly talking about the gameplay itself. There's a lot I would do to bring the narrative more in line with rationalist ideals. Personally I still found the ending emotionally satisfying as a tragedy. I don't think the little scout in the epilogue implies survival was possible. I think being able to witness and influence the events that take place is the "ultimate reward" given to the character for their boundless curiosity, in pure ludonarrative harmony.

I don't think there are any other games where the game is the mystery and the pure joy of discovery to this extent. The Hearthians are the only irrational actors in the narrative they've been left with, but they're endearing in that. It's not rationalist, but it's smart and well-written enough to fit my take on the classification as rational.

My favourite moment was to change the rule about who I was to make myself the wall, and suddenly I was half the map. Moved one step to the left and half the map moved, and instantly died because one of the walls hit a patch of water, and water had a rule about killing you.

** An interesting question. I can think of several video games that feature 'Rational' things, like AI, or honest pursuits of your goals. As was mentioned in previous threads, most multiplayer games qualify by default. Restricting it to "video games with a somewhat robust ruleset that the player must figure out on their own to succeed" I came up with the following two games:

​

1) Kerbal Space Program. Near real life orbital physics (the biology is made up). The game will explain some aspects of how it works in tutorials, but most of it it won't.

​

2) Pathologic (2). A game about saving a small town from a plague. How the plague works is not explained, and figuring out what is important, how it works and what is a distraction is important if you want to save everyone / as many as possible.

​

There's also two other games I feel are rational, but can't justify from any principled definition

Blood bowl: This is a multiplayer game, but I want to plug it for being heavily reliant upon decision-making under uncertainty (everything is a diceroll, so to get good you really have to get a feel for how high a risk 1/36 actually is).

​

Return of the Obra Dinn. Puzzle game that will test your powers of deduction and inference.

** [[/u/-main][u/-main]] already mentioned The Witness, but I'd like to go into a bit more depth. I think it's the current pinnacle of rationalism in gaming.

Bluntly: The Witness is Jonathan Blow's attempt to convey how to reason. It addresses capital i Insight, in the tradition of Buddhism, where it's specifically known as Vipassana. The aim of Vipassana practices, and of Buddhism as a whole, is to navigate reality without perceptual biases or goal conflicts; and Blow crafts a game which conveys each principle of that tool set, without a single instruction given to players.

How the game manages this deserves a moment by moment breakdown, but I don't want to go /that/ in depth in a comment. The abridged version is: by eliminating anything that isn't directly a part of, or framing for, a puzzle---including any extrinsic reward---Blow creates a filter for players who are intrinsically motivated by the desire to solve puzzles. The architecture of the game then guides the player into needing to observe more and more details of deeper and wider kinds, in order to learn how to progress; each new realization of what “irrelevant” object is actually key to solving the next iteration of puzzle complexity is made feasible, but the player ultimately has to be looking for and generating each small epiphany. Eventually, the player not only masters each type of puzzle, and the reasoning required to derive object-level solutions, but also masters the finding of and interpretation of new kinds of puzzles, which are invisible in plain sight until the player ups their thinking. This meta-level problem solving also gets mastered, and finally, the game puts the player into a timed barrage of all the puzzle types they've seen---but with slight innovations to all of them. Having given the player the chance and tools to 1) only play if their motivation to do so is strong and intrinsic, 2) master the activity of solving known problem types, and 3) master the process of learning new things, this stimulus is extremely likely to put players into an intense Flow state. While not quite enough to stand in for more robust forms of mental training, this is genuinely enough to nudge susceptible players into major “spiritual” insights---they may very well be able to notice how their minds work, and how reality actually is, at levels comparable to people who undergo thorough Enlightenment training. No, most people probably won't experience anything like the Buddhist concepts of Awakening...but some /might/, and that's incredibly extraordinary. And for those who don't, they'll still have a thoroughly visceral tour of each step along the Insight process.

Now, I'm actually not as big a fan of Buddhism as I might sound to be: despite my impression that it collects a lot of important information about how psychological change occurs, and how to best trigger and use it, it's dense at best and bullshit in many ways. Still, it's perhaps the most thorough understanding of how minds work that humans have, particularly in the rationalist sense of escaping bias and aligning goals. It's also insanely hard to communicate, as it's a series of mental realizations a person has to trigger themselves, but which consist of directly noticing the solutions to our most deep-rooted confusions.

Blow's game manages to make these concepts intuitive.

The Witness also includes cryptic, scattered quotes, which function as Koans: Zen-style riddles which prompt the listener to feel like they don't have enough information to comprehend, while clearly indicating that the riddle /does/ contain sufficient information, and therefore prompting a deep and thorough examination of things that would normally be half-noticed at most. These riddles, along with the literal stories and quotes they use---and their sources, which are well-known and relevant---fill out the conceptual background of the game. Even the title refers to Witness Consciousness: the concept that all a person really /is/, is a perceiver of perceptions: that they can't possibly be identical to any thing they've ever experienced, and as such, can only be the experiencer, if they are anything at all. (This idea is far more nuanced and has many competing versions, so I'm just focusing on my favorite dumbing down. Go read mctb.org if you wanna really start down these rabbit holes.)

I won't talk much about the harder-to-discover aspects of the game, but they all reinforce the Buddhist Insight progression, which is to say, the process of learning how to learn, and which in turn appears to just be a discarding of everything that gets in the way of learning---and part of the really interesting stuff is how that somehow seems to be possible, and work.

I've skimped extremely heavily on details and explanations here, out of a combination of laziness, desire for the game to speak for itself, and genuine difficulty explaining the concepts I'm trying to communicate. I'd say go for it: it's truly the only game I've ever seen that takes the total realization of rationality as its goal, and it genuinely has enough pieces of the puzzle, arranged properly, that the whole picture could actually come together for many players.

*** The following is not really worth reading if you haven't played the game.

I played through The Witness once, coming to the end with the island flyover. I don't remember feeling anything like this buddhist progression you describe. Is this buddhist concept a thing I should research, then play the game again? I didn't get to many of the extra challenges or even try to understand the 'koans'. I got pissed when they undid all my puzzle completion at the end. The video felt pretentious, not demonstrative.

I looked at a walkthrough twice; once for the sound patterns part, as I had my headphones off, and once for the dividing the colour groups mechanic, because I think I missed the tutorial puzzle for that? I couldn't get a single passing answer so eventually I gave up and looked up what the symbol meant.

**** So, this is one of the most frustrating pieces of Blow's style, which he has directly absorbed from Zen, Buddhism at large, mysticism as a whole, and modern art.

Blow's on the record as stating both that he can't verbalize the whole meaning/intent of his games, and that there /is/ a specific meaning/intent to every single thing in them. He's very much like the worst kind of art snob: “oh, I can't help you get it, you have to figure it out yourself. But if you don't you're dumb.” Blow and Buddhists could both do a lot better to first understand and then explain the concepts they're observing.

But they don't do so by and large---to plug it again, mctb.org, which Slate Star did a great review of, is the best counterexample I know of. Ingram calls this “mushroom culture”: they feed you shit and keep you in the dark.

As best I can tell, the value in this is that solving something on your own guidance---entirely, from start to finish---is not only The Skill that's being fostered, but is uniquely satisfying. Certainly that's the satisfaction I got from piecing this all together. However, I've also /ever been taught things/, and this made my eventual attempts at self learning /easier/ and /more satisfying/, not worse. So I personally agree with your frustrations, and think that having /any/ explanation put in front of players would be great. I don't think it's kind or helpful in any way to say to players, “well, if you don't automatically investigate what the game is about or search for interviews online about Blow's intent, then you don't really care about understanding, so you /shouldn't/ be given more help.” Giving someone the /first bit of context/ is not going to prevent them from developing self-motivation. But /not/ giving it, is gonna result in exactly the state you've gotten to.

Having said that...I may be wrong. There may be some really important reason why giving any guidance to people is gonna deprive them of key value, and paradoxically, if that's the case then I can't be told why. But that strikes me as utter bullshit, so at very least I'm skeptical.

All that said, the value I /do/ get from the game is so earth-shattering that I can even excuse this major frustration. Especially if maybe, there's a good reason for it. But since I don't think there is, here's what I wish everyone was told.

* * *

When approaching these riddles, just like in approaching the content of the game, you'll need to treat /literally every object/ as relevant and content-conveying in order to “get it”. It's as though you're handed a puzzle with 100 pieces, and 78 of them seem like duplicates or ones that don't fit. But if you examine them all /very carefully/, you find that there's actually ways to incorporate many of those pieces into a finished puzzle; and exactly one way to incorporate them all. That's what's happening here, and the pieces in Braid and The Witness are literally every event and object. Some only have small meanings, but until every piece is used, you're not done.

The hidden puzzles in The Witness are the part that convey this content, so people who aren't fully completing the game will just miss them and be frustrated. That's intentional: the cyclical ending you referenced is a direct analogue of the Buddhist cycle of death and rebirth. Just like in Buddhism, the way out is to be frustrated that that keeps happening, and resolve to figure out what can be done about it. Blow seems to intentionally let players just quit if this frustrates them, which seems like a giant missed opportunity when all he'd have to do is include an intro:

“Hi, I'm Jonathan Blow, and this game is trying to teach you something. It's necessary that I explain as little as possible, as learning how to figure things out for yourself is /the whole point/, but I want to let you know that everything you see here is a clue, so as long as that's worth your interest, don't be discouraged. And if it's not, then sincerely, that's great! This game is meant to be used and then moved on from, so your moving on once it's finished being useful is exactly our hope. Sure, if you leave before you fully “get” it, there may be some useful stuff still to be mined; but if you feel frustrated, then even if coming back later would help, beating yourself up mentally probably won't. So please don't waste your energy on this at times when it's not genuinely rewarding for you.

If you investigate this as if it were a world you were actually stuck in, albeit with your ability to look up information about the quotes and clips while you play kept intact, you should be able to solve it the way physicists or engineers solve problems. Very much the same way Feynman approaches everything in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman. Good luck, and if you do get fed up: apologies, I know it can be rough. Hopefully you'll agree, when you solve it, that the difficulty/unguidedness was necessary for conveying the full epiphany.”

So, I wish he'd done that. But yeah: getting confused at the end, and feeling like you've missed something, is almost certainly the intent. That's why the very first recording in the game is Gautama's quote about being trapped in a cycle of rebirth. The fact of the gameplay mirroring this cycle is meant to have the same effect that Buddhists ascribe to rebirth: you'll have to keep trying until you get it right. If you stop caring, cool: you'll just go do something else until it becomes worth your time to re-engage. Blow uses it as a filter: gamers who want to figure out what's happening will try again, gamers who don't won't.

Heavy themes of perception, understanding, belief and hypothesis formation, wonder at discovery, and the 'hand of the designer being heavy in the world' -- I don't know how else to say that. It makes the world feel purposeful and deliberate and internally-structured, then references God and scientific discovery in that context. Highly recommended.

*** I can't find the specific reference, but what came to mind from this suggestion was a quote from some old SF whose setting included widespread self-modification capacities, of a father advising his son on the many traps someone can drive themselves into in the first few moments of self-modifying. This was quoted in one of Eliezer's Sequence posts, IIRC something like "you must not become one of the Black Devas who pursue their momentary drives with such impossible fervor that they never surface, nor one of the White Devas who create so many walls cutting them off from their old biological instincts that they lose all motivation to act at all, nor the..." (there were at least a couple more cases). Eliezer's reply was "if these are universally agreed to be bad, /why would you give people the option/?"

Bioshock is a lot like that. It doesn't introduce the premise "Rationally self-interested society", it introduces the premise "Rationally self-interested society /which discovers addictive magic/". In other words, a society which values self-determination highly and discovers a potent and dangerous form of self-modification, which it then allows everyone access to... /mostly/ before learning that it's incredibly addictive and seems to cause insanity. Take a non-Flanderized society like the modern USA and it would have the same problems with a different spin.

**** For the curious, the specific reference here is The Golden Age by John C. Wright. It's a hyper-capitalist, hyper-transhumanist, fairly hard sci-fi novel, the first in a trilogy.

One of the conceits of the setting is that self agency is paramount, hence if you turn yourself into one of the black devas nobody will rescue you because you can no longer consent to it.

The first novel is brilliant; it's one of the best examples of a high conflict yet low violence sci-fi books I've ever seen. Unfortunately the rest of the series didn't live up to the promise, but the ending is good enough to treat it as a stand alone book.

***** Indeed! And I was specifically thinking of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MTjej6HKvPByx3dEA/devil-s-offers][this]], which was easy to find once I knew what it was quoting.

Deva = 'Manorial', and the other two were even more extreme forms of those, so I didn't remember perfectly.

**** great analysis, you are correct.

Another aspect, apart form the Plasmids destroying their society, was that the Rationalists of Rapture failed to realise how dangerous an Intelligent Irrationalist can be. Just as Ayn Rand they were based of, they thought someone who is not a rational agent does not pose a threat to them. Then Fontaine and Lamb shown them wrong.

Idk. Last time I saw Fontaine was Burial At Sea. I haven't played the original BioShock in several years, I'll have to play it again soon. But I really have a hard time believing that a [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Level 3 Intelligent Character]] can be portrayed outside a written medium, and I doubt Fontaine does anything that would qualify him as Level 2 Intelligent, but I could be wrong.

********* IMHO, Fontaine is borderline Level 2, but a lot of his success is due to recognising opportunity that was given to him on a silver platter. Im not sure how to think about it, because it falls into the crack between "intelligent" and "clever".

******* He flourished in Rapture only by taking advantage of it; if he committed to not working to 'destroy' it, it would have ceased to be somewhere he could flourish, that very instant. He was a black marketeer; subverting and undermining the local power structures and society was /literally his profession/.

I don't think hardcore libertarian/objectivisim of the kind professed in rapture is really a good model for rational self interest. Since there's a lot of situations where coordination and cooperation make game theoretical sense.

You could maybe view it as a group of people who thought they had discovered the One True Path to rationality, and pursued it in spite of evidence to the contrary. Making it a parable for updating your beliefs
