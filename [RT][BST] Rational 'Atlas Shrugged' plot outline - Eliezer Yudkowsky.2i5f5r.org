Edit: +I'm going to go through this and find the right spots for line breaks. Copy pasting on mobile sucks.+ That works.

Rational /Atlas Shrugged/ plot outline:

Dagny Taggart as an alternate Google cofounder, who's been pushing hard on robotic cars in order to reduce traffic accidents.

Hank Rearden is an alternate Tesla cofounder, trying to produce electric cars to reduce carbon footprints (he's not building rockets because Elon Musk is too powerful a character for this story).

Both of them were raised by different kinds of horrible parents who kept pushing altruism at them, and swore early on to live their lives for their own sake, nor ask any other to live their life for the sake of theirs. They studied game theory when they got to college and decided that the ideal of cooperating in iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas with other selfish people seemed very beautiful. They are aware that the part where they advise other people to be selfish is not what a Bayesian selfishness maximizer would do, but they see no point to some kind of crazy idealistic purity in their utility function.

Dagny and Hank are sick and tired of San Francisco's controls on new apartments making rents around them skyrocket and causing their employees to be hated, and they go around screaming "IF WE MUST HAVE TAXES CAN'T WE HAVE LAND VALUE TAXES?" and plotting a move to a charter city where they can have their all-electric all-robotic car grid and reasonable rents for their employees. They try to get together with alternate Amazon cofounder Ellis Wyatt to build the logistic systems they need, and Wyatt brings on board the notion of movable housing.

...and that's when things start to go wrong. The key people they need for the project keep... disappearing.

Francisco d'Anconia is the alternate Skype cofounder who was previously trying to build a cryptoequity system and find a country to support it---Dagny remembers Francisco being so enthusiastic about what correct equity and correct finance could accomplish---and then Francisco mysteriously dropped that project and now seems to be actively opposing projects like theirs.

Promising rationality theorist Hugh Akston now seems to mainly be writing fanfiction, though nobody knows where he's uploading the stories from.John Galt is a sad, conflicted figure played by Michael Vassar (obvious). Galt convinced Scott Sumner to drop out of pushing NGDP level targeting, after Galt realized that faster world economic growth was just pushing along the timeline to unFriendly AI. Galt doesn't /like/ everything he does to keep the Great Stagnation in place, he certainly doesn't gloat about it, he just doesn't see anything else he can do.

Galt's Gulch was funded by Midas Thiel and has all the things done correctly, as best they can at their relatively low tech level and with such poor economies of scale. They have robotic electric cars, because those can be made relatively cheaply, but no underground roads or movable housing. A lot of people working near Galt's Gulch are just farmers---very-well-educated farmers who couldn't make it in the insane System elsewhere. Others are retired founders or angel investors who don't want the police randomly kicking in their door one night because they use marijuara.

Mathematicians who can't make it through the insane funding situations of academia have been coming to Galt's Gulch's math monasteries, led by Hugh Akston. Other monasteries have the real social scientists who use Bayesian statistics, except for their plants in academia that publish frequentist articles to slow down the field. They have the real schools that rapid-test teaching units, which is how they produce their operatives that keep the Great Stagnation in place. They don't have any political power in the mainstream, all they have is a conspiracy. Their goal is not to cause a collapse but to just cause things to keep ticking along with slower economic growth, and to sabotage academic science that produces x-risks, though they've had more success sabotaging biology and medicine than computer science.

The existence of Galt's Gulch is well-known and not secret; only the conspiracy parts of it are nonpublic. As a whole, the town is very ideologically nonuniform but higher-IQ than average; in most ways it resembles a college town.

Overarching the entire story are newspapers and TV interviews with Tyler Cowen talking about the Great Stagnation, and the wild-haired conspiracy theorists screaming about how it's all a plot by John Galt and the Illuminati in Galt's Gulch. Naturally Galt planted the conspiracy theorists to make sure the idea was disreputable and never got any public attention from people trying to look Serious.

The real trick would be to have the story constantly exhibit the Objectivist!heroic virtues of self-reliance, non-appeal to altruism, cooperative selfish people, defiance of the System, etcetera, while normatively repairing all the parts that talk about rationality and economics.
